Heere bigynneth the Persouns Tale . CMCTPARS-M3,288.C1b.4

<heading>

Jer. 6=o= . State super vias , et videte , et interrogate de viis
antiquis que sit via bona , et ambulate in ea ; et invenietis
refrigerium animabus vestris , etc. CMCTPARS-M3,288.C1b.6

Oure sweete lord God of hevene , that no man wole perisse , but wole
that we comen alle to the knoweleche of hym , and to the blisful lif
that is perdurable , amonesteth us By the prophete Jeremie , that seith
in thys wyse : " Stondeth upon the weyes , and seeth And axeth of olde
pathes <paren> that is to seyn , of olde Sentences <$$paren> which is
the goode wey , and walketh in that wey , and ye shal fynde refresshynge
for youre soules , etc. " CMCTPARS-M3,288.C1b.7

Manye been the weyes espirituels that leden folk to oure Lord Jhesu
Crist , and to the regne of glorie . Of whiche weyes , ther is a ful
noble wey and ful covenable , which may nat fayle to man ne to womman
that thurgh synne hath mysgoon fro The righte wey of Jerusalem celestial
; CMCTPARS-M3,288.C1b.8

and This wey is cleped Penitence , of which man Sholde gladly herknen
and enquere with His herte , to wyten what is Penitence , and wheenes it
is cleped Penitence , and in how manye maners been the acciouns or
werkynges of Penitence , and how manye speces Ther been of Penitence ,
and whiche thynges Apertenen and bihoven to Penitence , and Whiche
thynges destourben Penitence . CMCTPARS-M3,288.C1b.9

Seint Ambrose seith that Penitence is the pleynynge of man for the gilt
that he hath doon , and namoore to do any thyng for which <P_288.C2b>
hym oghte to pleyne . CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.10

And som doctour seith , " Penitence is the waymentynge of man that
sorweth for his synne , CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.11

and pyneth hymself for he hath mysdoon . " CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.12

Penitence , With certeyne circumstances , is varray repentance of a man
that halt hymself in sorwe And oother peyne for his giltes .
CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.13

And for he shal be verray penitent , he shal first biwaylen The synnes
that he hath doon , and stidefastly purposen in his herte to have shrift
of mouthe , and to doon satisfaccioun , and nevere to doon thyng for
which hym oghte moore to biwayle Or to compleyne , and to continue in
goode werkes , CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.14

or elles his repentance may nat availle . CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.15

For , as seith Seint Ysidre , " He is a japere and A gabbere , and no
verray repentant , that eftsoone dooth thyng for which hym oghte repente
. " CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.16

Wepynge , and nat for to stynte to do synne , may nat avayle .
CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.17

But nathelees , men shal hope that every tyme that man falleth , be it
never so ofte , that he may arise thurgh Penitence , if he have grace ;
CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.18

but certeinly it is greet doute . CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.19

For , as seith Seint Gregorie , " unnethe ariseth he out of his synne ,
that is charged with the charge of yvel usage . "
CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.20

And therfore repentant folk , that stynte for to Synne , and forlete
synne er that synne forlete hem , hooly chirche holdeth hem siker of
hire savacioun . CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.21

And he that synneth and verraily repenteth hym in his laste , hooly
chirche yet hopeth his savacioun , by the grete mercy of Oure Lord Jhesu
Crist , for his repentaunce ; CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.22

but taak the siker wey . CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.23

And , now , sith I have declared yow what thyng is Penitence , now shul
ye understonde <P_289.C1> that ther been three acciouns of Penitence .
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.24

The firste is that if a man be baptized after that he hath synned .
Seint Augustyn seith , " But he be penytent for his olde synful lyf , he
may nat bigynne the newe clene lif . " CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.25

For , certes , if he be baptized withouten penitence of his olde gilt ,
he receyveth the mark of baptesme , but nat the grace ne the remission
of his synnes , til he have repentance verray . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.26

Another defaute is this : that men doon deedly synne after that they han
receyved baptesme . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.27

The thridde defaute is that men fallen in venial synnes after hir
baptesme , fro day to day . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.28

Therof seith Seint Augustyn that penitence of goode and humble folk is
the penitence of every day . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.29

The speces of Penitence been three . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.30

That oon of hem is solempne , CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.31

another is commune , CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.32

and the thridde is privee . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.33

Thilke penance that is solempne is in two maneres ; as to be put out of
hooly chirche in Lente , for slaughtre of children and swich maner thyng
. CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.34

Another is , whan a man hath synned openly , of which synne the fame is
openly spoken in the contree , CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.35

and thanne hooly chirche by juggement destreyneth hym for to do open
penaunce . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.36

Commune penaunce is that preestes enjoynen men communly in certeyn caas
, as for to goon Peraventure naked in pilgrimages , or barefoot .
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.37

Pryvee penaunce is thilke that men doon alday for privee synnes , of
whiche we shryve us prively and receyve privee penaunce .
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.38

Now shal@ @tow understande what is bihovely and necessarie to verray
perfit Penitence . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.39

And This stant on three thynges : Contricioun of Herte , Confessioun of
Mouth , and Satisfaction . for which seith Seint John Crisostom , "
Penitence destreyneth a man to accepte benygnely every peyne that hym is
enjoyned , with contricioun of herte , and shrift of mouth , with
satisfaccioun , and in werkynge of alle manere humylitee . "
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.40

And this is fruytful penitence agayn three thinges in which we wratthe
oure Lord Jhesu Crist ; this is to seyn , by delit in thynkynge , by
reccheleesnesse in spekynge , and by wikked synful werknyge .
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.41

And agayns thise wikkede giltes is Penitence , that may be likned unto a
tree . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.42

<P_289.C2>

The roote of this tree is Contricioun , that hideth hym in the herte of
hym that is verray repentaunt , right as the roote of a tree gydeth hym
in the erthe . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.44

Of the roote of Contricioun spryngeth a stalke that bereth braunches and
leves of Confessioun , and fruyt of Satisfaccioun . for which Crist
seith in his gospel , " Dooth digne fruyt of Penitence " ;
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.45

for by this fruyt may men knowe this tree , and nat by the roote that is
hyd in the herte of man , ne by the braunches , ne by the leves of
Confessioun . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.46

And therfore oure Lord Jhesu Crist seith thus : " By the fruyt of hem
shul ye knowen hem . " CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.47

Of this roote eek spryngeth a seed of grace , the which seed is mooder
of sikernesse , CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.48

and this seed is egre and hoot . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.49

The grace of this seed spryngeth of God thurgh remembrance of the day of
doom and on the peynes of helle . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.50

Of this matere seith Salomon that in the drede of God man forleteth his
synne . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.51

The heete of this seed is the love of God , and the desiryng of the joye
perdurable . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.52

This heete draweth the herte of a man to God CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.53

and dooth hym haten his synne . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.54

For soothly ther is nothyng that savoureth so wel to a child as the milk
of his norice , CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.55

ne nothyng is to hym moore abhomnyable than thilke milk whan it is
medled with oother mete . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.56

Right so the synful man that loveth his synne , hym semeth that it is to
him moost sweete of any thyng ; CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.57

but fro that tyme that he loveth sadly oure Lord Jhesu Crist , and
desireth the lif perdurable , ther n@ @ys to him no thyng moore
abhomynable . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.58

For soothly the lawe of God is the love of God ; for which David the
prophete seith : " I have loved thy lawe , and hated wikkednesse and
hate " ; CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.59

he that loveth God kepeth his lawe and his word . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.60

This tree saugh the prophete Daniel in spirit , upon the avysioun of the
kyng Nabugodonosor , whan he conseiled hym to do penitence .
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.61

Penaunce is the tree of lyf to hem that it receyven ,
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.62

and he that holdeth hym in verray penitence is blessed , after the
sentence of Solomon . CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.63

In this Penitence or Contricioun man shal Understonde foure thynges ;
that is to seyn , what is Contricioun , and whiche been the causes that
moeven a man to Contricioun , and how he <P_290.C1> sholde be contrit ,
and what Contricioun availleth to the soule . CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.64

Thanne is it thus : that contricioun is the verray sorwe that a man
receyveth in his herte for his synnes , with sad purpos to shryve hum ,
and to do penaunce , and neveremoore to do synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.65

And this sorwe shal been in this manere , as seith Seint Bernard :
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.66

" it shal been hevy and grevous , and ful sharp and poynaunt in herte .
" CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.67

First , for man hath agilt his Lord and his Creatour ;
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.68

and moore sharp and poynaunt , for he hath agilt hys Fader celestial ;
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.69

and yet moore sharp and Poynaunt , for he hath wrathed and agilt hym
that boghte hym , that with his precious blood hath delivered us fro the
bondes of synne , and fro the crueltee of the devel , and fro the peynes
of helle . CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.70

The causes that oghte moeve a man to Contricioun been sixe .
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.71

First a man shal remembre hym of his synnes ; CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.72

but looke he that thilke remembraunce ne be to hym no delit by no wey ,
but greet shame and sorwe for his gilt . CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.73

For Job seith , " Synful men doon werkes worthy of confusioun . "
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.74

And therfore seith Ezechie , " I wol remembre me alle the yeres of my
lyf in bitternesse of myn herte . " CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.75

And God seith in the Apocalipse , " Remembreth yow fro whennes that ye
been falle " ; CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.76

for biforn that tyme that ye synned , ye were the children of God and
lymes of the regne of God ; CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.77

but for youre synne ye been woxen thral , and foul , and membres of the
feend , hate of aungels , sclaundre of hooly chirche , and foode of the
false serpent , perpetueel matere of the fir of helle ; and yet moore
foul and abhomynable , CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.78

for ye trespassen so ofte tyme as dooth the hound that retourneth to
eten his spewyng . CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.79

And yet be ye fouler for youre longe continuyng in synne and youre
synful usage , for which ye be roten in youre synne , as a beest in his
dong . CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.80

Swiche manere of thoghtes maken a man to have shame of his synne , and
no delit , as God seith by the prophete Ezechiel , CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.81

" Ye shal remembre yow of youre weyes , CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.82

and they shuln displese yow . " CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.83

Soothly synnes been the weyes that leden folk to helle .
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.84

The seconde cause that oghte make a man to have desdeyn of synne is this
: that , as seith Seint Peter , " whoso that dooth synne is thral
<P_290.C2> of synne " ; CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.85

and synne put a man in greet thraldom . CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.86

And therfore seith the prophete Ezechiel : " I wente sorweful in desdayn
of myself . " CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.87

Certes , wel oghte a man have desdayn of synne and withdrawe hym from
that thraldom and vileynye . CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.88

And lo , what seith Seneca in this matere ? CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.89

He seith thus : CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.90

" Though I wiste that neither God ne man ne sholde nevere knowe it , yet
wolde I have desdayn for to do synne . " CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.91

And the same Seneca also seith : " I am born to gretter thynges than to
be thral to my body , or than for to maken of my body a thral . "
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.92

Ne a fouler thral may no man ne womman maken of his body than for to
yeven his body to synne . CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.93

Al were it the fouleste cherl or the fouleste womman that lyveth , and
leest of value , yet is he thanne moore foul and moore in servitute .
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.94

Evere fro the hyer degree that man falleth , the moore is he thral , and
moore to God and to the world vile and abhomynable .
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.95

O goode God , wel oghte man have desdayn of synne , sith that thurgh
synne ther he was free now is he maked bonde . CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.96

And therfore seyth Seint Augustyn : " If thou hast desdayn of thy
servant , if he agilte or synne , have thou thanne desdayn that thou
thyself sholdest do synne . " CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.97

Tak reward of thy value , that thou ne be foul to thyself .
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.98

Allas , wel oghten they thanne have desdayn to been servauntz and
thralles to synne , and soore been ashamed of hemself that God of his
endelees goodnesse hath set hem in heigh estaat , or yeven hem wit ,
strengthe of body , heele , beautee , prosperitee , and boghte hem fro
the deeth with his herte-blood , that they so unkyndely , agayns his
gentilesse , quiten hym so vileynsly to slaughtre of hir owene soules .
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.99

O goode God , ye wommen that been of so greet beautee , remembreth yow
of the proverbe of Salomon . CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.100

He seith , " Likneth a fair womman that is a fool of hire body lyk to a
ryng of gold that were in the groyn of a soughe . "
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.101

For right as a soughe wroteth in everich ordure , so wroteth she hire
beautee in the stynkynge ordure of synne . CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.102

The thridde cause that oghte moeve a man to Contricioun is drede of the
day of doom and of the horrible peynes of helle .
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.103

For as Seint <P_291.C1> Jerome seith , " At every tyme that me
remembreth of the day of doom I quake ; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.104

for whan I ete or drynke , or what so that I do , evere semeth me that
the trompe sowneth in myn ere : CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.105

' Riseth up , ye that been dede , CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.106

and cometh to the juggement . ' " CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.107

O goode God , muchel oghte a man to drede swich a juggement , " ther as
we shullen been alle , " as Seint Poul seith , " biforn the seete of
oure Lord Jhesu Crist " ; where@ @as he shal make a general
congregacioun , where@ @as no man may been absent .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.108

For certes there availleth noon essoyne ne excusacioun . And nat oonly
that oure defautes shullen be jugged , but eek that alle oure werkes
shullen openly be knowe . CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.109

And , as seith Seint Bernard , " Ther ne shal no pledynge availle , ne
no sleighte ; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.110

we shullen yeven rekenynge of everich ydel word . "
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.111

Ther shul we han a juge that may nat been deceyved ne corrupt .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.112

And why ? CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.113

For , certes , alle oure thoghtes been discovered as to hym ,
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.114

ne for preyere ne for meede he shal nat been corrupt .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.115

And therfore seith Salomon , " The wratthe of God ne wol nat spare no
wight , for preyere ne for yifte " ; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.116

and therfore , at the day of doom ther n@ @ys noon hope to escape .
Wherfore , as seith Seint Anselm , " Ful greet angwyssh shul the synful
folk have at that tyme ; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.117

ther shal the stierne and wrothe juge sitte above , and under hym the
horrible pit of helle open to destroyen hym that moot biknowen his
synnes , whiche synnes openly been shewed biforn God and biforn every
creature ; and in the left syde mo develes than herte may bithynke , for
to harye and drawe the synful soules to the peyne of helle ;
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.118

and withinne the hertes of folk shal be bitynge conscience ,
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.119

and withouteforth shal be the world al brennynge .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.120

Whider shall thanne the wrecched synful man flee to hiden hym ?
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.121

Certes , he may nat hyden hym ; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.122

he moste come forth and shewen hym . " CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.123

For certes , as seith seint Jerome , " the erthe shal casten hym out of
hym , and the see also , and the eyr also , that shal be ful of
thonder-clappes and lightnynges . " CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.124

Now soothly , whoso wel remembreth hym of thise thynges , I gesse that
his synne shal nat turne hym into delit , but to greet sorwe for drede
of the peyne of helle . CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.125

And therfore seith Job to God , " Suffre , <P_291.C2> Lord , that I may
a while biwaille and wepe , er I go withoute returnyng to the derke lond
, covered with the derknesse of deeth , to the lond of mysese and of
derknesse , where@ @as is the shadwe of deeth , whereas ther is noon
ordre or ordinaunce but grisly drede that evere shal laste . "
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.126

Loo , heere may ye seen that Job preyde respit a while to biwepe and
waille his trespas , CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.127

for soothly oo day of respit is bettre than al the tresor of this world
. CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.128

And forasmuche as a man may acquiten hymself biforn God by penitence in
this world , and nat by tresor , therfore sholde he preye to God to yeve
hym respit a while to biwepe and biwaillen his trespas .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.129

For certes , al the sorwe that a man myghte make fro the bigynnyng of
the world n@ @ys but a litel thyng at regard of the sorwe of helle .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.130

The cause why that Job clepeth helle the " lond of derknesse " :
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.131

understondeth that he clepeth it " lond " or erthe , for it is stable
and nevere shal faille ; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.132

" derk , " for he that is in helle hath defaute of light material .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.133

For certes , the derke light that shal come out of the fyr that evere
shal brenne shal turne hym al to peyne that is in helle
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.134

for it sheweth him to the horrible develes that hym tormenten .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.135

" Covered with the derknesse of deeth " - that is to seyn , that he that
is in helle shal have defaute of the sighte of God ,
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.136

for certes the sighte of God is the lyf perdurable .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.137

" The derknesse of deeth " been the synnes that the wrecched man hath
doon , whiche that destourben hym to see the face of God , right as
dooth a derk clowde bitwixe us and the sonne . CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.138

" Lond of misese , " by cause that ther been three maneres of defautes ,
agayn three thynges that folk of this world han in this present lyf ;
that is to seyn , honours , delices , and richesses .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.139

Agayns honour , have they in helle shame and confusioun .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.140

For wel ye woot that men clepen honour the reverence that man doth to
man , CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.141

but in helle is noon honour ne reverence . CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.142

For certes , namoore reverence shal be doon there to a kyng than to a
knave . For which God seith by the prophete Jeremye , " Thilke folk
that me despisen shul been in despit . " CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.143

Honour is eek cleped greet lordshipe ; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.144

ther shal no wight serven other , but of harm and torment .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.145

Honour is eek cleped greet dignytee and heighnesse ,
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.146

but in helle shul they been al fortroden of develes .
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.147

And <P_292.C1> God seith , " The horrible develes shulle goon and comen
upon the hevedes of the dampned folk . " CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.148

And this is for as muche as the hyer that they were in this present lyf
, the moore shulle they been abated and defouled in helle .
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.149

Agayns the richesse of this world shul they han mysese of poverte ,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.150

and this poverte shal been in foure thynges : CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.151

In defaute of tresor , of which that David seith , " The riche folk ,
that embraceden and oneden al hire herte to tresor of this world , shul
slepe in the slepynge of deeth ; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.152

and nothyng ne shal they fynden in hir handes of al hir tresor . "
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.153

And mooreover the myseyse of helle shal been in defaute of mete and
drinke . CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.154

For God seith thus by Moyses : " They shul been wasted with hunger ,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.155

and the briddes of helle shul devouren hem with bitter deeth ,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.156

and the galle of the dragon shal been hire drynke , and the venym of the
dragon hire morsels . " CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.157

And forther_over , hire myseyse shal been in defaute of clothyng ,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.158

for they shulle be naked in body as of clothyng , save the fyr in which
they bree and othere filthes ; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.159

and naked shul they been of soule , as of alle manere vertues , which
that is the clothyng of the soule . CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.160

Where been thanne the gaye robes , and the softe shetes , and the smale
shertes ? CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.161

loo , what seith God of hem by the prophete Ysaye :
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.162

that " under hem shul been strawed motthes , and hire covertures shulle
been of womres of helle . " CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.163

And forther_over , hir myseyse shal been in defaute of freendes .
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.164

For he n@ @ys nat povre that hath goode freendes ;
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.165

but there is no frend , CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.166

for neither God ne no creature shal been freend to hem ,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.167

and everich of hem shal haten oother with deedly hate .
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.168

" The sones and the doghtren shullen rebellen agayns fader and mooder ,
and kynrede agauns kynrede , and chiden and despisen everich of hem
oother bothe day and nyght , " as God seith by the prophete Michias .
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.169

And the lovynge children , that whilom loveden so flesshly everich
oother , Wolden everich of hem eten oother if they Myghte .
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.170

For how sholden they love hem togidre in the peyne of helle , whan they
hated everich of hem oother in the prosperitee of this lyf ?
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.171

For truste wel , hir flesshly love was deedly hate , as seith the
prophete David : CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.172

<P_292.C2>

" whoso that loveth wikkednesse , he hateth his soule . "
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.174

And whoso hateth his owene soule , certes , he may love noon oother
wight in no manere . CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.175

And therfore , in helle is no solas ne no freendshipe ,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.176

but evere the moore flesshly kynredes that been in helle , the Moore
cursynges , the more chidynges , and the moore deedly hate ther is among
hem . CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.177

And forther_over , they shul have defaute of alle manere delices .
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.178

For certes , delices been after the appetites of the fyve wittes , as
sighte , herynge , smellynge , savorynge , and touchynge .
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.179

But in helle hir sighte shal be ful of derknesse And of smoke , and
therfore ful of teeres ; and hir herynge ful of waymentynge and of
gryntynge of teeth , as seith Jhesu Crist . CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.180

Hir nose-thirles shullen be ful of stynkynge stynk ;
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.181

and as seith Ysaye the prophete , " hir savoryng shal be ful of bitter
galle " ; and touchynge of al hir body ycovered with " fir that nevere
shal quenche , and with wormes that nevere shul dyen , " as God seith by
the mouth of Ysaye . CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.182

And for as muche as they shul nat wene that they may dyen for peyne ,
and by hir deeth flee fro peyne , that may they understonden by the word
of Job , that seith , " ther as is the shadwe of deeth . "
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.183

Certes , a shadwe hath the liknesse of the thyng of which it is shadwe ,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.184

but shadwe is nat the same thyng of which it is shadwe .
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.185

Right so fareth the peyne of helle ; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.186

it is lyk deeth for the horrible angwissh , CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.187

and why ? CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.188

For it peyneth hem evere , as though they sholde dye anon ;
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.189

but certes , they shal nat dye . CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.190

For , as seith Seint Gregorie , " To wrecche caytyves shal be deeth
withoute deeth , and ende withouten ende , and defaute withoute failynge
. CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.191

For hir deeth shal alwey lyven , CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.192

and hir ende shal everemo bigynne , CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.193

and hir defaute shal nat faille . " CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.194

And therfore seith Seint John the Evaungelist , " they shullen folwe
deeth , CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.195

and they shul nat fynde hym ; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.196

and they shul desiren to dye , CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.197

and deeth shal flee fro hem . " CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.198

And eek Job seith that in helle is noon ordre of rule .
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.199

And al be it so that God hath creat alle thynges in right ordre , and no
thyng withouten ordre , but alle thynges been ordeyned and nombred ; yet
, nathelees , they that been dampned been nothyng in ordre ,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.200

ne holden noon ordre , CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.201

for the erthe ne shal bere hem no fruyt . CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.202

For , as the prophete David seith , " God shal destroie the fruyt of the
erthe as fro hem ; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.203

ne water ne <P_293.C1> shal yeve hem no moisture , ne the eyr no
refresshyng , ne fyr no light . " CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.204

For , as seith Seint Basilie , " the brennynge of the fyr of this world
shal God yeven in helle to hem that been dampned ,
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.205

but the light and the cleernesse shal be yeven in hevene to this
children , " right as the goode man yeveth flessh to his children and
bones to his houndes . CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.206

And for they shullen have noon hope to escape , seith Seint Job at@ @te
laste that " ther shal horrour and grisly drede dwellen withouten ende .
" CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.207

Horrour is alwey drede of harm that is to come , CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.208

and this drede shal evere dwelle in the hertes of hem that been dampned
. CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.209

And therfore han they lorn al hire hope , for sevene causes .
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.210

First , for God , that is hir juge , shal be withouten mercy to hem ;
and they may nat plese hym ne noon of his halwes ; ne they ne may yeve
no thyng for hir raunsoun ; ne they have no voys to speke to hym ; ne
they may nat fle fro peyne ; ne they have no goodnesse in hem , that
they mowe shewe to delivere hem fro peyne . CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.211

And therfore seith Salomon : " the wikked man dyeth ,
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.212

and whan he is deed , he shal have noon hope to escape fro peyne . "
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.213

Whoso thanne wolde wel understande thise peynes , and bithynke hym weel
that he hath deserved thilke peynes for his synnes , certes , he sholde
have moore talent to Siken and to wepe , than for to syngen and to pleye
. CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.214

For , as that seith Salomon , " Whoso that hadde the science to knowe
the peynes that been establissed and ordeyned for synne , he wolde make
sorwe . " CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.215

" Thilke science , " as seith Seint Augustyn , " maketh a man to
waymenten in his herte . " CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.216

The fourthe point that oghte maken a man to have contricion is the
sorweful remembraunce of the good that he hath left to doon heere in
erthe , and eek the good that he hath lorn . CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.217

Soothly , the goode werkes that he hath lost , outher they been the
goode werkes that he wroghte er he fel into deedly synne , or elles the
goode werkes that he wroghte while he lay in synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.218

Soothly , the goode werkes that he dide biforn that he fil in synne been
al mortefied and astoned and dulled by the ofte synnyng .
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.219

The othere goode werkes , that he wroghte whil he lay in deedly synne ,
thei been outrely dede , as to the lyf perdurable in hevene .
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.220

<P_293.C2>

Thanne thilke goode werkes that been mortefied by ofte synnyng , whiche
goode werkes he dide whil he was in charitee , ne mowe nevere quyken
agayn withouten verray penitence . CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.222

And therof seith God by the mouth of Ezechiel , that " if the rightful
man returne agayn from his rightwisnesse and werke wikkednesse , shal he
lyve ? " CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.223

Nay , for alle the goode werkes that he hath wroght ne shul nevere been
in remembraunce , CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.224

for he shal dyen in this synne . CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.225

And upon thilke chapitre seith Seint Gregorie thus :
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.226

that " we shulle understonde this principally ; that whan we doon Deedly
synne , it is for noght thanne to rehercen or drawen into memorie the
goode werkes that we han wroght biforn . " CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.227

For certes , in the werkynge of the deedly synne , ther is no trust to
no good werk that we han doon biforn ; that is to seyn , as for to have
therby the lyf perdurable in hevene . CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.228

But nathelees , the goode werkes quyken agayn , CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.229

and comen agayn , CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.230

and helpen , CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.231

and availlen to have the lyf perdurable in hevene , whan we han
contricioun . CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.232

but soothly , the goode werkes that men doon whil they been in deedly
synne , for as muche as they were doon in deedly synne , they may nevere
quyke agayn . CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.233

For certes , thyng that nevere hadde lyf may nevere quykene ;
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.234

and nathelees , al be it that they ne availle noght to han the lyf
perdurable , yet availlen they to abregge of the peyne of helle , or
elles to geten temporal richesse , or elles that God wole the rather
enlumyne and lightne the herte of the synful man to have repentaunce ;
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.235

and eek they availlen for to usen a man to doon goode werkes , that the
feend have the lasse power of his soule . CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.236

And thus the curteis Lord Jhesu Crist ne wole that no good werk be lost
, CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.237

for in somwhat it shal availle . CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.238

But , for as muche as the goode werkes that men doon whil they been in
good lyf been al mortefied by synne folwynge , and eek sith that alle
the goode werkes that men doon whil They been in deedly synne been
outrely dede as for to have the lyf perdurable , wel may that man that
no good werk ne dooth synge thilke newe frenshe song , " jay tout perdu
mon temps et mon labour . " CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.239

For certes , synne bireveth a man bothe goodnesse of nature and eek the
goodnesse of grace . CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.240

For soothly , the grace of <P_294.C1> the Hooly Goost fareth lyk fyr ,
that may nat been ydel ; CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.241

for fyr fayleth anoon as it forleteth his wirkynge ,
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.242

and right so grace fayleth anoon as it forleteth his werkynge .
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.243

Then leseth the synful man the goodnesse of glorie , that oonly is
bihight to goode men that labouren and werken . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.244

Wel may he be sory thanne , that oweth al his lif to God as longe as he
hath lyved , and eek as longe as he shal lyve , that no goodnesse ne
hath to paye with his dette to God to whom he oweth al his lyf .
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.245

For trust wel , " He shal yeven acountes , " as seith Seint Bernard , "
of alle the goodes that han be yeven hym in this present lyf , and how
he hath hem despended , $in so muche that ther shal nat perisse an heer
of his heed , ne a moment of an houre ne shal nat perisse of his tyme ,
that he ne shal yeve of it a rekenyng . " CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.246

The fifthe thyng that oghte moeve a man to contricioun is remembrance of
the passioun that oure Lord Jhesu Crist suffred for oure synnes .
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.247

For , as seith Seint Bernard , " Whil that I lyve I shal have
remembrance of the travailles that oure Lord Crist suffred in prechyng :
his werynesse in travaillyng , his temptaciouns whan he fasted , his
longe wakynges whan he preyde , hise teeres whan that he weep for pitee
of good peple , the wo and the shame and the filthe that men seyden to
hym , of the foule spittyng that men spitte in his face , of the
buffettes that men yaven hym , of the foule mowes , and of the repreves
that men to hym seyden , of the nayles with whiche he was nayled to the
croys , and of al the remenant of his passioun that he suffred for my
synnes , CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.248

and no thyng for his gilt . " CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.249

And ye shul understonde that in mannes synne is every manere of ordre or
ordinaunce turned up-so-doun . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.250

For it is sooth that God , and resoun , and sensualitee , and the body
of man been so ordeyned that everich of thise foure thynges sholde have
lordshipe over that oother , as thus : CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.251

God sholde have lordshipe over resoun , and resoun over sensualitee ,
and sensualitee over the body of man . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.252

But Soothly , whan man synneth , al this ordre or ordinaunce is turned
up-so-doun . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.253

And therfore thanne , for as muche as the resoun of man ne wol nat be
subget ne obeisant to God , that is his lord by right , therfore leseth
it the lordshipe <P_294.C2> that it sholde have over sensualitee , and
eek over the body of man . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.254

And why ? CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.255

For sensualitee rebelleth thanne agayns resoun , CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.256

and by that way leseth resoun the lordshipe over sensualitee and over
the body . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.257

For right as resoun is rebel to God , right so is bothe sensualitee
rebel to resoun and the body also . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.258

And certes this disordinaunce and this rebellioun oure Lord Jhesu Crist
aboghte Upon his precious body ful deere , CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.259

and herkneth in which wise . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.260

For as muche thanne as resoun is rebel to God , therfore is man worthy
to have sorwe and to be deed . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.261

This suffred oure Lord Jhesu Crist for man , after that he hadde be
bitraysed of his disciple , and distreyned and bounde , so that his
blood brast out at every nayl of his handes , as seith Seint Augustyn .
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.262

And forther_over , for as muchel As resoun of man ne wol nat daunte
sensualitee whan it may , therfore is man worthy to have shame ;
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.263

and this suffred oure Lord Jhesu Crist for man , whan they spetten in
his visage . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.264

And forther_over , for as muchel thanne as the caytyf body of man is
rebel bothe to resoun and to sensualitee , therfore is it worthy the
deeth . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.265

And this suffred oure Lord Jhesu Crist for man upon the croys where as
ther was no part of his body free withouten greet peyne and bitter
passioun . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.266

And al this suffred Jhesu Crist , that nevere forfeted .
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.267

And therfore resonably may be seyd of Jhesu in this manere :
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.268

" To muchel am I peyned for the thynges that I nevere deserved , and to
muche defouled for shendshipe that man is worthy to have . "
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.269

And therfore may the synful man wel seye , as seith Seint Bernard ,
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.270

" Acursed be the bitternesse of my synne , for which ther moste be
suffred so muchel bitternesse . " CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.271

For certes , after the diverse $disordinaunces of oure wikkednesses was
the passioun of Jhesu Crist ordeyned in diverse thynges .
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.272

As thus : Certes , synful mannes soule is bitraysed of the devel by
coveitise of temporeel prosperitee , and scorned by deceite whan he
cheseth flesshly delices ; CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.273

and yet is it tormented by inpacience of adversitee , And bispet by
servage and subjeccioun of synne ; CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.274

and at@ @te laste it is slayn fynally . CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.275

For <P_295.C1> this disordinaunce of synful man was Jhesu Crist first
bitraysed , CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.276

and after that was he bounde , that cam for to unbynden us of synne and
peyne . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.277

Thanne was he byscorned , that oonly sholde han been honoured in alle
thynges and of alle thynges . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.278

Thanne was his visage , that oghte be desired to be seyn of al mankynde
, in which visage aungels desiren to looke , Vileynsly bispet .
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.279

Thanne was he scourged , that no thyng hadde agilt ;
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.280

and finally , thanne was he crucified and slayn .
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.281

Thanne was acompliced the word of Ysaye , " He was wounded for oure
mysdedes and defouled for oure felonies . " CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.282

Now sith that Jhesu Crist took upon hymself the peyne of alle oure
wikkednesses , muchel oghte synful man wepen and biwayle , that for his
synnes Goddes sone of hevene sholde al this peyne endure .
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.283

The sixte thyng that oghte moeve a man to contricioun is the hope of
three thynges ; that is to seyn , foryifnesse of synne , and the yifte
to grace wel for to do , and the glorie of hevene , with which God shal
gerdone man for his goode dedes . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.284

And for as muche as Jhesu Crist yeveth us thise yiftes of his largesse
and of his sovereyn bountee , therfore is he cleped Jhesus Nazarenus rex
Judeorum . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.285

Jhesus is to seyn " saveour " or " salvacioun , " on whom men shul hope
to have foryifnesse of synnes , which that is proprely salvacioun of
synnes . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.286

And therfore seyde the aungel to Joseph , " Thou shalt clepen his name
Jhesus , that shal saven his peple of hir synnes . "
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.287

And heerof seith Seint Peter : " Ther is noon oother name under hevene
that is yeve to any man , by which a man may be saved , but oonly Jhesus
. " CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.288

Nazarenus is as muche for to seye as " florisshynge , " in which a man
shal hope that he that yeveth hym remissioun of synnes shal geve hym eek
grace wel for to do . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.289

For in the flour is hope of fruyt in tyme comynge , and in foryifnesse
of synnes hope of grace wel for to do . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.290

" I was at@ @te dore of thyn herte , seith Jhesus ,
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.291

" and cleped for to entre . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.292

He that openeth to me shal have foryifnesse of synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.293

I wol entre into hym by my grace , and soupe with hym , " by the goode
werkes that he shal doon , whiche werkes been the foode of God ;
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.294

<P_295.C2>

" and he shal soupe with me " by the grete joye that I shal yeven hym .
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.296

Thus shal man hope , for his werkes of penaunce that God shal yeven hym
his regne , as he bihooteth hym in the gospel . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.297

Now shal a man understonde in which manere shal been his contricioun .
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.298

I seye that it shal been universal and total . This is to seyn , a man
shal be verray repentaunt for alle his synnes that he hath doon in delit
of his thoght , CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.299

for delit is ful perilous . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.300

For ther been two manere of consentynges : CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.301

that oon of hem is cleped consentynge of affeccioun , whan a man is
moeved to do synne , and deliteth hym longe for to thynke on that synne
; CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.302

and his reson aperceyveth it wel that it is synne agayns the lawe of God
, CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.303

and yet his resoun refreyneth nat his foul delit or talent , though he
se wel apertly that it is agayns the reverence of God .
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.304

Although his resoun ne consente noght to doon that synne in dede , yet
seyn somme doctours that swich delit that dwelleth longe , it is ful
perilous , al be it nevere so lite . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.305

And also a man sholde sorwe namely for al that evere he hath desired
agayn the lawe of God with perfit consentynge of his resoun ,
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.306

for therof is no doute , that it is deedly synne in consentynge .
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.307

For certes , ther is no deedly synne , that it n@ @as first in mannes
thought , and after that in his delit , and so forth into consentynge
and into dede . Wherfore I seye that many men ne repenten hem nevere of
swiche thoghtes and delites , ne nevere shryven hem of it , but oonly of
the dede of grete synnes outward . Wherfore I seye that swiche wikked
delites and wikked thoghtes been subtile bigileres of hem that shullen
be dampned . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.308

Mooreover , man oghte to sorwe for his wikkede wordes as wel as for his
wikkede dedes . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.309

For certes , the repentaunce of a synguler synne , and nat repente of
alle his othere synnes , or elles repenten hym of alle his othere synnes
, and nat of a synguler synne , may nat availle .
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.310

For certes , God almyghty is al good , CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.311

and therfore he foryeveth al , or elles right noght .
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.312

And heerof seith Seint Augustyn , " I wot certeynly that God is enemy to
everich synnere . " CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.313

and how Thanne ? CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.314

He that observeth o synne , shal he have foryifnesse of the remenaunt of
his othere synnes ? CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.315

Nay . CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.316

And forther_over , contrcioun <P_296.C1a> sholde be wonder sorweful and
angwissous ; CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.317

and therfore yeveth hym God pleynly his mercy ; CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.318

and therfore , whan my soule was angwissous withinne me , I hadde
remembrance of God that my preyere myghte come to hym .
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.319

Forther_over , contricioun moste be continueel , and that man have
stedefast purpos to shriven hym , and for to amenden hym of his lyf .
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.320

For soothly , whil contricioun lasteth , man may evere have hope of
foryifnesse ; CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.321

and of this comth hate of synne , that destroyeth synne , bothe in
himself , and eek in oother folk , at his power . For which seith David
: " ye that loven God , hateth wikkednesse . " CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.322

For trusteth wel , to love God is for to love that he loveth , and hate
that he hateth . CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.323

The laste thyng that men shal understonde in contricioun is this :
wherof avayleth contricioun . CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.324

I seye that somtyme contricioun delivereth a man fro synne ; of which
that David seith , " I seye , " quod David <paren> that is to seyn , I
purposed fermely <$$paren> " to shryve me , CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.325

and thow , Lord , relessedest my synne . " CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.326

And right so as Contricion availleth noght withouten sad purpos of
shrifte , if man have oportunitee , right <P_296.C2a> so litel worth is
shrifte or satisfaccioun withouten contricioun .
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.327

And mooreover contricion destroyeth the prisoun of helle ,
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.328

and maketh wayk and fieble alle the strengthes of the develes ,
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.329

and restoreth the yiftes of the Hooly Goost and of alle goode vertues ;
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.330

and it clenseth the soule of synne , CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.331

and delivereth the soule fro the peyne of helle , and fro the compaignye
of the devel , and fro the servage of synne , CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.332

and restoreth it to alle goodes espirituels , and to the compaignye and
communyoun of hooly chirche . CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.333

And forther_over , it maketh hym that whilom was sone of ire to be sone
of grace ; CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.334

and alle thise thynges been preved by hooly writ .
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.335

And therfore , he that wolde sette his entente to thise thynges , he
were ful wys ; CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.336

for soothly he ne sholde nat thanne in al his lyf have corage to synne ,
but yeven his body and al his herte to the service of Jhesu Crist , and
therof doon hym hommage . CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.337

For soothly oure sweete Lord Jhesu Crist hath spared us so debonairly in
oure folies , that if he ne hadde pitee of mannes soule , a sory song we
Myghten alle synge . CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.338

<P_296.C1b>

The seconde partie of Penitence is Confessioun , that is signe of
contricioun . CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.343

Now shul ye understonde what is Confessioun , and wheither it oghte
nedes be doon or noon , and whiche thynges been covenable to verray
Confessioun . CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.344

First shal@ @tow understonde that Confessioun is verray shewynge of
synnes to the preest . CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.345

This is to seyn " verray , " for he moste confessen hym of alle the
condiciouns that bilongen to his synne , as ferforth as he kan .
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.346

Al moot be seyd , and no thyng excused ne hyd ne forwrapped ,
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.347

and noght avaunte thee of thy goode werkes . CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.348

And forther_over , it is necessarie to understonde whennes that synnes
spryngen , and how they encreessen and whiche they been .
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.349

Of the spryngynge of synnes seith Seint Paul in this wise : that " Right
as by a man synne entred first into this world , and thurgh that synne
deeth , right so thilke deeth entred into alle <P_296.C2b> men that
synneden . " CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.350

And this man was Adam , by whom synne entred into this world , whan he
brak the comaundementz of God . CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.351

And therfore , he that first was so myghty that he sholde nat have dyed
, bicam swich oon that he moste nedes dye , wheither he wolde or noon ,
and al his progenye in this world , that in thilke man synneden .
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.352

Looke that in th'@ @estaat of innocence , whan Adam and Eve naked weren
in Paradys , and nothyng ne hadden shame of hir nakednesse , how that
the serpent , that was moost wily of alle othere beestes that God hadde
maked , seyde to the womman , " Why comaunded God to yow ye sholde nat
eten of every tree in Paradys ? " CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.353

The womman answerde : " Of the fruyt , " quod she , " of the trees in
Paradys we feden us , CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.354

but soothly , of the fruyt of the tree that is in the myddel of Paradys
, God forbad us for to ete , ne nat touchen it , lest per_aventure we
sholde dyen . " CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.355

The serpent seyde to the womman , " Nay , nay , ye shul nat dyen of
deeth ; CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.356

for sothe , God woot that what day that ye eten therof , youre eyen shul
opene and ye shul been as goddes , knowynge good and harm . "
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.357

The womman thanne <P_297.C1> saugh that the tree was good to feedyng ,
and fair to the eyen , and delitable to the sighte .
CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.358

She took of the fruyt of the tree , CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.359

and eet it , CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.360

and yaf to hire housbonde , CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.361

and he eet , CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.362

and anoon the eyen of hem bothe openeden . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.363

And whan that they knewe that they were naked , they sowed of fige leves
a maner of breches to hiden hire membres . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.364

There may ye seen that deedly synne hath , first , suggestion of the
feend , as sheweth heere by the naddre ; and afterward , the delit of
the flessh , as sheweth heere by Eve ; and after that , the consentynge
of resoun , as sheweth heere by Adam . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.365

For trust wel , though so were that the feend tempted Eve - that is to
seyn , the flessh - and the flessh hadde delit in the beautee of the
fruyt defended , yet certes , til that resoun - that is to seyn , Adam -
consented to the etynge of the fruyt , yet stood he in th'@ @estaat of
innocence . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.366

Of thilke Adam tooke we thilke synne original , CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.367

for of hym flesshly descended be we alle , and engendred of vile and
corrupt mateere . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.368

And whan the soule is put in oure body , right anon is contract original
synne ; CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.369

and that that was erst but oonly peyne of concupiscence is afterward
bothe peyne and synne . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.370

And therfore be we alle born sones of wratthe and of dampnacioun
perdurable , if it n@ @ere baptesme that we receyven , which bynymeth us
the culpe . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.371

But for sothe , the peyne dwelleth with us , as to temptacioun , which
peyne highte concupiscence . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.372

And this concupiscence , whan it is wrongfully disposed or ordeyned in
man , it maketh hym coveite , by coveitise of flessh , flesshly synne ,
by sighte of his eyen as to erthely thynges , and eek coveitise of
hynesse by pride of herte . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.373

Now , as for to speken of the firste coveitise , that is concupiscence ,
after the lawe of oure membres that weren lawefulliche ymaked and by
rightful juggement of God , I seye , forasmuche as man is nat obeisaunt
to God , that is his lord , therfore is the flessh to hym disobeisaunt
thurgh concupiscence , which yet is cleped norrissynge of synne and
occasioun of synne . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.374

Therfore , al the while that a man hath in hym the peyne of
concupiscence , it is impossible but he be tempted somtime and moeved in
his flessh to synne . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.375

And this thyng may nat faille as longe <P_297.C2> as he lyveth ;
CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.376

it may wel wexe fieble and faille by vertu of baptesme and by the grace
of God thurgh penitence , CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.377

but fully ne shal it nevere quenche , that he ne shal som tyme be moeved
in hymself , but if he were al refreyded by siknesse , or by malefice of
sorcerie , or colde drynkes . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.378

For lo , what seith Seint Paul : " The flessh coveiteth agayn the spirit
, and the spirit agayn the flessh ; CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.379

they been so contrarie and so stryven that a man may nat alway doon as
he wolde . " CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.380

The same Seint Paul , after his grete penaunce in water and in lond - in
water by nyght and by day in greet peril and in greet peyne ; in lond ,
in famyne and thurst , in coold and cloothlees , and ones stoned almoost
to the deeth - yet seyde he , " Allas , I caytyf man !
CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.381

Who shal delivere me fro the prisoun of my caytyf body ? "
CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.382

And Seint Jerome , whan he longe tyme hadde woned in desert , where as
he hadde no compaignye but of wilde beestes , where as he ne hadde no
mete but herbes , and water to his drynke , ne no bed but the naked
erthe , for which his flessh was blak as an Ethiopeen for heete , and ny
destroyed for coold , yet seyde he that " the brennynge of lecherie
boyled in al his body . " Wherfore I woot wel sykerly that they been
deceyved that seyn that they ne be nat tempted in hir body .
CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.383

Witnesse on Seint Jame the Apostel , that seith that " every wight is
tempted in his owene concupiscence " ; that is to seyn , that everich of
us hath matere and occasioun to be tempted of the norissynge of synne
that is in his body . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.384

And therfore seith Seint John the Evaungelist , " If that we seyn that
we be withoute synne , we deceyve us selve , CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.385

and trouthe is nat in us . " CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.386

Now shal ye understonde in what manere that synne wexeth or encreesseth
in man . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.387

The firste thyng is thilke norissynge of synne of which I spak biforn ,
thilke flesshly concupiscence . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.388

And after that comth the subjeccioun of the devel - this is to seyn ,
the develes bely , with which he bloweth in man the fir of flesshly
concupiscence . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.389

And after that , a man bithynketh hym wheither he wol doon or no thilke
thing to which he is tempted . CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.390

And thanne , if that a man withstonde and weyve the firste entisynge of
his flessh and of the feend , thanne is it no synne ;
CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.391

<P_298.C1>

and if it so be that he do nat so , thanne feeleth he anoon a flambe of
delit . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.393

And thanne is it good to be war and kepen hym wel ,
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.394

or elles he wol falle anon into consentynge of synne ;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.395

and thanne wol he do it , if he may have tyme and place .
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.396

And of this matere seith Moyses by the devel in this manere :
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.397

" The feend seith , ' I wole chace and pursue the man by wikked
suggestioun , CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.398

and I wole hente hym by moevynge or stirynge of synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.399

And I wol departe my prise or my praye by deliberacioun ,
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.400

and my lust shal been acompliced in delit . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.401

I wol drawe my swerd in consentynge ' " - for certes , right as a swerd
departeth a thyng in two peces , right so consentynge departeth God fro
man - CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.402

" ' and thanne wol I sleen hym with myn hand in dede of synne ' ;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.403

thus seith the feend . " CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.404

For certes , thanne is a man al deed in soule . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.405

And thus is synne acompliced by temptacioun , by delit , and by
consentynge ; CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.406

and thanne is the synne cleped actueel . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.407

For sothe , synne is in two maneres ; CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.408

outher it is venial or deedly synne . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.409

Soothly , whan man loveth any creature moore than Jhesu Crist oure
Creatour , thanne is it deedly synne . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.410

And venial synne is it , if man love Jhesu Crist lasse than hym oghte .
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.411

For sothe , the dede of this venial synne is ful perilous ,
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.412

for it amenuseth the love that men sholde han to God moore and moore .
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.413

And therfore , if a man charge hymself with manye swiche venial synnes ,
certes , but if so be that he somtyme descharge hym of hem by shrifte ,
they mowe ful lightly amenuse in hym al the love that he hath to Jhesu
Crist ; CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.414

and in this wise skippeth venial into deedly synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.415

For certes , the moore that a man chargeth his soule with venial synnes
, the moore is he enclyned to fallen into deedly synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.416

And therfore lat us nat be necligent to deschargen us of venial synnes .
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.417

For the proverbe seith that " Manye smale maken a greet . "
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.418

And herkne this ensample . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.419

A greet wawe of the see comth som tyme with so greet a violence that it
drencheth the ship . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.420

And the same harm doon som tyme the smale dropes of water , that entren
thurgh a litel crevace into the thurrok , and in the botme of the ship ,
if men be so necligent that they ne descharge hem nat by_tyme .
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.421

<P_298.C2>

And therfore , although ther be a difference bitwixe thise two causes of
drenchynge , algates the ship is dreynt . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.423

Right so fareth it somtyme of deedly synne , and of anoyouse veniale
synnes , whan they multiplie in a man so greetly that <em> the love of
<$$em> thilke worldly thynges that he loveth , thurgh whiche he synneth
venyally , is as greet in his herte as the love of God , or moore .
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.424

And therfore , the love of every thyng that is nat biset in God , ne
doon principally for Goddes sake , although that a man love it lasse
than God , yet is it venial synne ; and deedly synne whan the love of
any thyng weyeth in the herte of man as muchel as the love of God , or
moore . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.425

And therfore , the love of every thyng that is nat biset in God , ne
doon principally for Goddes sake , although that a man love it lasse
than God , yet is it venial synne ; and deedly synne whan the love of
any thyng weyeth in the herte of man as muchel as the love of God , or
moore . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.426

" Deedly synne , " as seith Seint Augustyn , " is whan a man turneth his
herte fro God , which that is verray sovereyn bountee , that may nat
chaunge , and yeveth his herte to thyng that may chaunge and flitte . "
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.427

And certes , that is every thyng save God of hevene .
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.428

For sooth is that if a man yeve his love , the which that he oweth al to
God with al his herte , unto a creature , certes , as muche of his love
as he yeveth to thilke creature , so muche He bireveth fro God ;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.429

and therfore dooth he synne . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.430

For he that is dettour to God ne yeldeth nat to God al his dette ; that
is to seyn , al the love of his herte . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.431

Now sith man understondeth generally which is venial synne , thanne is
it covenable to tellen specially of synnes whiche that many a man
peraventure ne demeth hem nat synnes , and ne shryveth him nat of the
same thynges , CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.432

And yet natheless they been synnes , soothly , as thise clerkes writen ,
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.433

this is to seyn , that at every tyme that a man eteth or drynketh moore
than suffiseth to the sustenaunce of his body , in certein he dooth
synne . CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.434

And eek whan he speketh moore than it nedeth , it is synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.435

Eke whan he herkneth nat benignely the compleint of the povre ;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.436

eke whan he is in heele of body , and wol nat faste whan other folk
faste , withouten cause resonable ; CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.437

eke whan he slepeth moore than nedeth , or whan he comth by thilke
enchesoun to late to chirche , or to othere werkes of charite ;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.438

eke whan he useth his wyf , withouten sovereyn desir of engendrure to
the honour of God , or for the entente to yelde to his wyf the dette of
his body ; CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.439

eke whan he wol nat visite the sike and the prisoner , if he may ;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.440

eke if he love wyf or child , or oother <P_299.C1a> worldly thyng ,
moore than resoun requireth ; CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.441

eke if he flatere or blandise moore than hym oghte for any necessitee ;
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.442

eke if he amenuse or withdrawe the almesse of the povre ;
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.443

eke if he apparailleth his mete moore deliciously than nede is , or ete
it to hastily by likerousnesse ; CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.444

eke if he tale vanytees at chirche or at Goddes service , or that he be
a talker of ydel wordes of folye or of vileynye ,
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.445

for he shal yelden acountes of it at the day of doom ;
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.446

eke whan he biheteth or assureth to do thynges that he may nat parfourne
; CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.447

eke whan that he by lightnesse or folie mysseyeth or scorneth his
neighebor ; CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.448

eke whan he hath any wikked suspecioun of thyng ther he ne woot of it no
soothfastnesse : CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.449

thise thynges , and no withoute nombre , been synnes , as seith Seint
Augustyn . CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.450

Now shal men understonde that , al be it so that noon erthely man may
eschue alle venial <P_299.C2a> synnes , yet may he refreyne hym by the
brennynge love that he hath to oure Lord Jhesu Christ , and by preyeres
and confessioun and othere goode werkes , so that it shal but litel
greve . CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2a.451

For , as seith Seint Augustyn , " If a man love God in swich manere that
al that evere he dooth is in the love of God , and for the love of God
verraily , for he brenneth in the love of God , looke , how muche that a
drope of water that falleth in a fourneys ful of fyr anoyeth or greveth
, CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2a.452

so muche anoyeth a venial synne unto a man that is perfit in the love of
Jhesu Crist . " CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2a.453

men may also refreyne venial synne by receyvynge worthily of the
precious body of Jhesu Crist ; by receyvynge eek of hooly water , by
almesdede , by general confessioun of Confiteor at masse and at complyn
, and by blessynge of bisshopes and of preestes , and by oothere goode
werkes . CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2a.454

Now been they cleped chieftaynes , for as muche as they been chief and
spryng of alle othere synnes . CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1b.461

Of the roote of thise sevene synnes , thanne , is Pride the general
roote of alle harmes . CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1b.462

For of this roote spryngen certein braunches , as Ire , Envye , Accidie
or Slewthe , Avarice or Coveitise <paren> to commune understondynge
<$$paren> , Glotonye , and Lecherye . CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1b.463

And everich of thise chief synnes hath his braunches and his twigges ,
as shal be declared in hire chapitres folwynge .

And thogh so be that no man kan outerly telle the nombre of the twigges
and of the harmes that cometh of Pride , yet wol I shewe a partie of hem
, as ye shul understonde . CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1b.468

<P_299.C2b>

Ther is inobedience , avauntynge , ypocrisie , despit , arrogance ,
inpudence , swellynge of herte , insolence , elacioun , inpacience ,
strif , contumacie , presumpcioun , Irreverence , pertinacie , veyne
glorie , and many another twig that I kan nat declare .
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.470

Inobedient is he that disobeyeth for despit to the comandementz of God ,
and to his sovereyns , and to his goostly fader .
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.471

Avauntour is he that bosteth of the harm or of the bountee that he hath
doon . CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.472

Ypocrite is he that hideth to shewe hym swich as he is , and sheweth hym
swich as he noght is . CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.473

Despitous is he that hath desdeyn of his neighebor - that is to seyn ,
of his evene-Cristene - or hath despit to doon that hym oghte to do .
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.474

Arrogant is he that thynketh that he hath thilke bountees in hym that he
hath noght , or weneth that he sholde have hem by his desertes , or
elles he demeth that he be that he n@ @ys nat . CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.475

Inpudent is he that for his pride hath no shame of his <P_300.C1> synnes
. CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.476

Swellynge of herte is whan a man rejoyseth hym of harm that he hath doon
. CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.477

Insolent is he that despiseth in his juggement alle othere folk , as to
regard of his value , and of his konnyng , and of his spekyng , and of
his beryng . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.478

Elacioun is whan he ne may neither suffre to have maister ne felawe .
CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.479

Inpacient is he that wol nat been ytaught ne undernome of his vice , and
by strif werreieth trouthe wityngly , and deffendeth his folye .
CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.480

Contumax is he that thurgh his indignacioun is agayns everich auctoritee
or power of hem that been his sovereyns . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.481

Presumpcioun is whan a man undertaketh an emprise that hym oghte nat do
, or elles that he may nat do ; CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.482

and this is called surquidrie . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.483

Irreverence is whan men do nat honour there as hem oghte to doon , and
waiten to be reverenced . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.484

Pertinacie is whan man deffendeth his folie , and truseth to muchel to
his owene wit . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.485

Veyneglorie is for to have pompe and delit in his temporeel hynesse ,
and glorifie hym in this worldly estaat . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.486

Janglynge is whan a man speketh to muche biforn folk , and clappeth as a
mille , and taketh no keep what he seith . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.487

And yet is ther a privee spece of Pride , that waiteth first to be
salewed er he wole salewe , al be he lasse worth than {worth} that
oother is peraventure ; CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.488

and eek he waiteth or desireth to sitte , or elles to goon above hym in
the wey , or kisse pax , or been encensed , or goon to offryng biforn
his neighebor , and swiche semblable thynges , agayns his duetee ,
peraventure , but that he hath his herte and his entente in swich a
proud desir to be magnified and honoured biforn the peple .
CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.489

Now been ther two maneres of Pride : CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.490

that oon of hem is withinne the herte of man , CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.491

and that oother is withoute . Of whiche , soothly , thise forseyde
thynges , and mo than I have seyd , apertenen to Pride that is in the
herte of man ; CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.492

and that othere speces of Pride been withoute . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.493

But natheles that oon of thise speces of Pride is signe of that oother ,
right as the gaye leefsel at@ @te taverne is signe of the wyn that is in
the celer . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.494

And this is in manye thynges : as in speche and contenaunce , <P_300.C2>
and in outrageous array of clothyng . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.495

For certes , if ther ne hadde be no synne in clothyng , Crist wolde nat
so soone have noted and spoken of the clothyng of thilke riche man in
the gospel . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.496

And , as seith Seint Gregorie , that " precious clothyng is cowpable for
the derthe of it , and for his softenesse , and for his strangenesse and
degisynesse , and for the superfluitee , or for the inordinat scantnesse
of it . " CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.497

Allas , may man nat seen , as in oure dayes , the synful costlewe array
of clothynge , and namely in to muche superfluite , or elles in to
desordinat scantnesse ? CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.498

As to the first synne , that is in superfluitee of clothynge , which
that maketh it so deere , to harm of the peple ; nat oonly the cost of
embrowdynge , the degise endentynge or barrynge , owndynge , palynge ,
wyndynge or bendynge , and semblable wast of clooth in vanitee , but
ther is also costlewe furrynge in hir gownes , so muche pownsonynge of
chisels to maken holes , so muche daggynge of sheres ; forthwith the
superfluitee in lengthe of the forseide gownes , trailynge in the dong
and in the mire , on horse and eek on foote , as wel of man as of womman
, that al thilke trailyng is verraily as in effect wasted , consumed ,
thredbare , and roten with donge , rather than it is yeven to the povre
, to greet damage of the forseyde povre folk . And that in sondry wise
; CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.499

this is to seyn that the moore that clooth is wasted , the moore moot it
coste to the peple for the scarsnesse . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.500

And forther_over , if so be that they wolde yeven swich pownsoned and
dagged clothyng to the povre folk , it is nat convenient to were for
hire estaat , ne suffisant to beete hire necessitee , to kepe hem fro
the distemperance of the firmament . CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.501

Upon that oother side , to speken of the horrible disordinat scantnesse
of clothyng , as been thise kutted sloppes , or haynselyns , that thurgh
hire shortnesse ne covere nat the shameful membres <P_301.C1> of man ,
to wikked entente . Allas , somme of hem shewen the boce of hir shap ,
and the horrible swollen membres , that semeth lik the maladie of hirnia
, in the wrappynge of hir hoses ; CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.502

and eek the buttokes of hem faren as it were the hyndre part of a
she-ape in the fulle of the moone . CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.503

And mooreover , the wrecched swollen membres that they shewe thurgh
disgisynge , in departynge of hire hoses in whit and reed , semeth that
half hir shameful privee membres weren flayne . CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.504

And if so be that they departen hire hoses in othere colours , as is
whit and blak , or whit and blew , or blak and reed , and so forth ,
thanne semeth it , as by variaunce of colour , that half the partie of
hire privee membres were corrupt by the fir of Seint Antony , or by
cancre , or by oother swich meschaunce . CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.505

Of the hyndre part of hir buttokes , it is ful horrible for to see .
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.506

For certes , in that partie of hir body ther as they purgen hir
stynkynge ordure , that foule partie shewe they to the peple prowdly in
despit of honestitee , which honestitee that Jhesu Crist and his
freendes observede to shewen in hir lyve . CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.507

Now , as of the outrageous array of wommen , God woot that though the
visages of somme of hem seme ful chaast and debonaire , yet notifie they
in hire array of atyr likerousnesse and pride . CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.508

I sey nat that honestitee in clothynge of man or womman is uncovenable ,
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.509

but certes the superfluitee or disordinat scantitee of clothynge is
reprevable . CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.510

Also the synne of aornement or of apparaille is in thynges that
apertenen to ridynge , as in to manye delicat horses that been hoolden
for delit , that been so faire , fatte , and costlewe ; and also in many
a vicious knave that is sustened by cause of hem ; and in to curious
harneys , as in sadeles , in crouperes , peytrels , and bridles covered
with precious clothyng , and riche barres and plates of gold and of
silver . For which God seith by Zakarie the prophete , " I wol
confounde the rideres of swiche horses . " CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.511

This folk taken litel reward of the ridynge of Goddes sone of hevene ,
<P_301.C2> and of his harneys whan he rood upon the asse , and ne hadde
noon oother harneys but the povre clothes of his disciples ;
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.512

ne we ne rede nat that evere he rood on oother beest .
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.513

I speke this for the synne of superfluitee , and nat for resonable
honestitee , whan reson it requireth . CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.514

And forther_over , certes , pride is greetly notified in holdynge of
greet meynee , whan they be of litel profit or of right no profit , and
namely whan that meynee is felonous and damageous to the peple by
hardynesse of heigh lordshipe or by wey of offices .
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.515

For certes , swiche lordes sellen thanne hir lordshipe to the devel of
helle , whanne they sustenen the wikkednesse of hir meynee . Or elles ,
whan this folk of lowe degree , as thilke that holden hostelries ,
sustenen the thefte of hire hostilers , CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.516

and that is in many manere of deceites . CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.517

Thilke manere of folk been the flyes that folwen the hony , or elles the
houndes that folwen the careyne . CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.518

Swich forseyde folk stranglen spiritually hir lordshipes ; for which
thus seith David the prophete : CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.519

" Wikked deeth moote come upon thilke lordshipes ,
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.520

and God yeve that they moote descenden into helle al doun ,
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.521

for in hire houses been iniquitees and shrewednesses and nat God of
hevene . " CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.522

And certes , but if they doon amendement , right as God yaf his benysoun
to $Laban by the service of Jacob , and to $Pharao by the service of
Joseph , right so God wol yeve his malisoun to swiche lordshipes as
sustenen the wikkednesse of hir servauntz , but they come to amendement
. CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.523

Pride of the table appeereth eek ful ofte ; for certes , riche men been
cleped to festes , and povre folk been put awey and rebuked . Also in
excesse of diverse metes and drynkes , and namely swich manere
bake-metes and dissh-metes , brennynge of wilde fir and peynted and
castelled with papir , and semblable wast , so that it is abusioun for
to thynke . And eek in to greet preciousnesse of vessel and curiositee
of mynstralcie , by whiche a man is stired the moore to delices of
luxurie , CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.524

if so be that he sette his herte <P_302.C1> the lasse upon oure Lord
Jhesu Crist , certeyn it is a synne ; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.525

and certeinly the delices myghte been so grete in this caas that man
myghte lightly falle by hem into deedly synne . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.526

The especes that sourden of Pride , soothly whan they sourden of malice
ymagined , avised , and forncast , or elles of usage , been deedly
synnes , CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.527

it is no doute . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.528

and whan they sourden by freletee unavysed , and sodeynly withdrawen
ayeyn , al been they grevouse synnes , I gesse that they ne been nat
deedly . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.529

Now myghte men axe wherof that pride sourdeth and spryngeth ,
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.530

and I seye , somtyme it spryngeth of the goodes of nature , and somtyme
of the goodes of fortune , and somtyme of the goodes of grace .
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.531

Certes , the goodes of nature stonden outher in goodes of body or in
goodes of soule . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.532

Certes , goodes of body been heele of body , strengthe , delivernesse ,
beautee , gentrice , franchise . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.533

goodes of nature of the soule been good wit , sharp understondynge ,
subtil engyn , vertu natureel , good memorie . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.534

goodes of fortune been richesse , hyghe degrees of lordshipes ,
preisynges of the peple . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.535

Goodes of grace been science , power to suffre spiritueel travaille ,
benignitee , vertuous contemplacioun , withstondynge of temptacioun ,
and semblable thynges . of whiche forseyde goodes , certes it is a ful
greet folye a man to priden hym in any of hem alle .
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.536

Now as for to speken of goodes of nature , God woot that somtyme we han
hem in nature as muche to oure damage as to oure profit .
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.537

As for to speken of heele of body , certes it passeth ful lightly ,
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.538

and eek it is ful ofte enchesoun of the siknesse of oure soule .
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.539

For , God woot , the flessh is a ful greet enemy to the soule ,
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.540

and therfore , the moore that the body is hool , the moore be we in
peril to falle . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.541

Eke for to pride hym in his strengthe of body , it is an heigh folye .
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.542

For certes , the flessh coveiteth agayn the spirit ,
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.543

and ay the moore strong that the flessh is , the sorier may the soule be
. CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.544

And over al this , strengthe of body and worldly hardynesse causeth ful
ofte many a man to peril and meschaunce . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.545

Eek for to pride hym of his gentrie is ful greet folie ;
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.546

for Ofte tyme the gentrie of the body binymeth the gentrie of the soule
; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.547

and eek we ben alle of o fader and of o mooder ; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.548

and alle we been of o nature , roten and corrupt , bothe riche and
<P_302.C2> povre . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.549

For sothe , o manere gentrie is for to Preise , that apparailleth mannes
corage with vertues and moralitees , and maketh hym Cristes child .
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.550

For truste wel that over what man that synne hath maistrie , he is a
verray cherl to synne . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.551

Now been ther generale signes of gentillesse , as eschewynge of vice and
ribaudye and servage of synne , in word , in werk , and contenaunce ,
and usynge vertu , curteisye , and clennesse , and to be liberal - that
is to seyn , large by mesure - CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.552

For thilke that passeth mesure is folie and synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.553

Another is to remembre hym of bountee , that he of oother folk hath
receyved . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.554

another is to be benigne to his goode subetis ; wherfore seith Senek , "
Ther is no thing moore covenable to a man of heigh estaat than
debonairetee and pitee . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.555

And therfore thise flyes that men clepen bees , whan they maken hir kyng
, they chesen oon that hath no prikke wherwith he may stynge . "
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.556

Another is , a man to have a noble herte and a diligent , to attayne to
heighe vertuouse thynges . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.557

Now certes , a man to pride hym in the goodes of grace is eek an
outrageous folie , CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.558

for thilke yifte of grace that sholde have turned hym to goodnesse and
to medicine , turneth hym to venym and to confusioun , as seith Seint
Gregorie . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.559

Certes also , whoso prideth hym in the goodes of fortune , he is a ful
greet fool ; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.560

for somtyme is a man a greet Lord by the morwe , that is a caytyf and a
wrecche er it be nyght ; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.561

and somtyme the richesse of a man is cause of his deth ;
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.562

somtyme the delices of a man ben cause of the grevous maladye thurgh
which he dyeth . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.563

Certes , the commendacioun of the peple is somtyme ful fals and ful
brotel for to triste ; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.564

this day they preyse , CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.565

tomorwe they blame . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.566

God woot , desir to have commendacioun eek of the peple hath caused
deeth to many a bisy man . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.567

<heading>

Remedium contra peccatum Superbie . CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.569

<$$heading>

Now sith that so is that ye han understonde what is Pride , and whiche
been the speces of it , And whennes Pride sourdeth and spryngeth , now
shul ye understonde which is <P_303.C1> the remedie agayns the synne of
Pride ; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.571

and that is hymylitee , or mekenesse . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.572

That is a vertu thurgh which a man hath verray knoweleche of hymself ,
and holdeth of hymself no pris ne deyntee , as in regard of his desertes
, considerynge evere his freletee . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.573

Now been ther three maneres of hymylitee : as humylitee in herte ;
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.574

another hymylitee is in his mouth ; the thridde in his werkes .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.575

The humilitee in herte is in foure maneres . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.576

That oon is whan a man holdeth hymself as noght worth biforn God of
hevene . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.577

Another is whan he ne despiseth noon oother man .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.578

The thridde is whan he rekketh nat , though men holde hym noght worth .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.579

The ferthe is whan he n@ @ys nat sory of his humiliacioun .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.580

Also the humilitee of mouth is in foure thynges : in attempree speche ,
and in humblesse of speche , and whan he biknoweth with his owene mouth
that he is swich as hym thynketh that he is in his herte .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.581

Another is whan he preiseth the bountee of another man ,
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.582

and nothyng therof Amenuseth . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.583

Humilitee eek in werkes is in foure maneres . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.584

The firste is whan he putteth othere men biforn hym .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.585

The seconde is to chese the loweste place over_al .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.586

The thridde is gladly to assente to good conseil .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.587

The Ferthe is to stonde gladly to the award of his sovereyns , or of hym
that is in hyer degree . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.588

Certein , this is a greet werk of hymylitee . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.589

<heading>

Sequitur de Invidia . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.591

<$$heading>

After Pride wol I speken of the foule synne of Envye , which that is ,
as by the word of the Philosophre , " sorwe of oother mannes prosperitee
" ; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.593

and after the word of Seint Augustyn , it is " Sorwe of oother mennes
wele , and joye of othere mennes harm . " CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.594

This foule synne is platly agayns the Hooly Goost .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.595

Al be it so that every Synne is agayns the Hooly Goost , yet nathelees ,
for as muche as bountee aperteneth proprely to the Hooly Goost , and
Envye comth proprely of malice , therfore it is proprely agayn the
bountee of the Hooly Goost . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.596

Now hath malice two speces ; that is to seyn , hardnesse of herte in
wikkednesse , CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.597

or elles the flessh of man is so blynd that he considereth nat that he
is in synne , or rekketh nat that he is in synne , which is the
hardnesse of the devel . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.598

That <P_303.C2> oother spece of malice is whan a man werreyeth trouthe ,
whan he woot that it is trouthe ; and eek whan he werreyeth the grace
that God hath yeve to his neighebor ; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.599

and al this is by Envye . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.600

Certes , thanne is Envye the worste synne that is .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.601

For soothly , alle othere synnes been somtyme oonly agayns o special
vertu , CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.602

but certes , envye is agayns alle vertues and agayns alle goodnesses .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.603

For it is sory of alle the bountees of his neighebor ,
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.604

and in this manere it is divers from alle othere synnes .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.605

For wel unnethe is ther any synne that it ne hath som delit in itself ,
save oonly Envye , that evere hath in itself angwissh and sorwe .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.606

The speces of Envye been thise . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.607

Ther is first , sorwe of oother mannes goodnesse and of his prosperitee
; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.608

and prosperitee is kyndely matere of joye ; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.609

thanne is envye a synne agayns kynde . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.610

The seconde spece of Envye is joye of oother mannes harm ,
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.611

and that is proprely lyk to the devel , that evere rejoyseth hym of
mannes harm . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.612

Of thise two speces comth bakbityng ; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.613

and this synne of bakbityng or detraccion hath certeine speces , as thus
: CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.614

Som man preiseth his neighebor by a wikked entente ,
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.615

for he maketh alwey a wikked knotte at@ @te laste ende .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.616

Alwey he maketh a " but " at@ @te laste ende , that is digne of moore
blame , than worth is al the preisynge . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.617

The seconde spece is that if a man be good , and dooth or seith a thing
to good entente , the bakbitere wol turne al thilke Goodnesse up-so-doun
to his shrewed entente . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.618

The thridde is to amenuse the bountee of his neighebor .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.619

The fourthe spece of bakbityng is this : that if men speke goodnesse of
a man , thanne wol the bakbitere seyn , " Parfey , swich a man is yet
bet than he , " in dispreisynge of hym that men preise .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.620

The fifte spece is this : for to consente gladly and herkne gladly to
the harm that men speke of oother folk . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.621

This synne is ful greet CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.622

and ay encreesseth after the wikked entente of the bakbitere .
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.623

After bakbityng cometh gruchchyng or murmuracioun ;
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.624

and somtyme it spryngeth of inpacience agayns God , and som-tyme agayns
man . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.625

Agayn God it is , whan a man gruccheth agayn the peyne of helle , or
agayns poverte , or los of catel , or agayn reyn or tempest ; or elles
gruccheth that shrewes han prosperitee , or elles for the goode men han
adversitee . CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.626

And alle thise thynges sholde man suffre paciently ,
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.627

for they comen by the rightful juggement and <P_304.C1> ordinaunce of
God . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.628

Somtyme comth grucching of avarice ; as judas grucched agayns the
magdaleyne , whan she enoynted the heved of oure Lord Jhesu Crist with
hir precious oynement . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.629

This manere murmure is swich as whan man gruccheth of goodnesse that
hymself dooth , or that oother folk doon of hir owene catel .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.630

Somtyme comth murmure of Pride ; as whan Simon the Pharisse gruchched
agayn the Magdaleyne , whan she approched to Jhesu Crist and weep at his
feet for hire synnes . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.631

And somtyme grucchyng sourdeth of Envye , whan men discovereth a mannes
harm that was pryvee or bereth hym on hond thyng that is fals .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.632

Murmure eek is ofte amonges servauntz that grucchen whan hir sovereyns
bidden hem doon leveful thynges ; CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.633

And forasmuche as they dar nat openly withseye the comaundementz of hir
sovereyns , yet wol they seyn harm , and grucche , and murmure prively
for verray despit ; whiche wordes men clepen the develes Pater noster ,
though so be that the devel ne hadde nevere Pater noster , but that
lewed folk yeven it swich a name . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.634

Somtyme it comth of Ire or prive hate , that norisseth rancour in herte
, as afterward I shal declare . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.635

Thanne cometh eek bitternesse of herte , thurgh which bitternesse every
good dede of his neighebor semeth to hym bitter and unsavory .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.636

Thanne cometh discord , that unbyndeth alle manere of freendshipe .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.637

Thanne comth scornynge of his neighebor , al do he never so weel .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.638

Thanne comth accusynge , as whan man seketh occasioun to anoyen his
neighebor , which that is lyk the craft of the devel , that waiteth
bothe Nyght and day to accusen us alle . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.639

Thanne Comth malignitee , thurgh which a man anoyeth his neighebor
prively , if he may ; CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.640

and if he noght may , algate his wikked wil ne shal nat wante , as for
to brennen his hous pryvely , or empoysone or sleen his beestes , and
semblable thynges . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.641

<heading>

Remedium contra peccatum Invidie . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.643

<$$heading>

Now wol I speke of remedie agayns this foule synne of Envye .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.645

First is the love of God principal , and lovyng of his neighebor as
hymself , CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.646

for soothly , that oon ne may nat been withoute that oother .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.647

And truste wel that in the name of thy neighebor thou shalt <P_304.C2>
understonde the name of thy brother ; CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.648

for certes alle we have o fader flesshly , and o mooder - That is to
seyn , adam and eve - and eek o fader espiritueel ,
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.649

and that is God of hevene . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.650

Thy neighebor ar@ @tow holden for to love , and wilne hym alle goodnesse
; CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.651

and therfore seith God , " Love thy neighebor as thyselve " - that is to
seyn , to salvacioun bothe of lyf and of soule . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.652

And mooreover thou shalt love hym in word , and in benigne amonestynge
and chastisynge , And conforten hym in his anoyes , and preye for hym
with al thyn herte . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.653

And in dede thou shalt love hym in swich wise that thou shalt doon to
hym in charitee as thou woldest that it were doon to thyn owene persone
. CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.654

And therfore thou ne shalt doon hym no damage in wikked word , ne harm
in his body , ne in his catel , ne in his soule , by entissyng of wikked
ensample . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.655

Thou shalt nat desiren his wyf , ne none of his thynges .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.656

Understoond eek that in the name of neighebor is comprehended his enemy
. CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.657

Certes , man shal loven his enemy , by the comandement of God ;
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.658

and soothyly thy freend shal@ @tow love in God . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.659

I seye , thyn enemy shal@ @tow love for goddes sake , by his comandement
. CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.660

For if it were reson that man sholde haten his enemy , for sothe God n@
@olde nat receyven us to his love that been his enemys .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.661

Agayns three manere of wronges that his enemy dooth to hym , he shal
doon three thynges , as thus : CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.662

Agayns hate and rancour of herte , he shal love hym in herte .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.663

Agayns chidyng and wikkede wordes , he shal preye for his enemy .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.664

Agayns the wikked dede of his enemy , he shal doon hym bountee .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.665

for Crist seith , " Loveth youre enemys , CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.666

and preyeth for hem that speke yow harm , and eek for hem that yow
chacen and pursewen , CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.667

and dooth bountee to hem that yow haten . " CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.668

Loo , thus comaundeth us oure Lord Jhesu Crist to do to oure enemys .
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.669

For soothly , nature dryveth us to loven oure freends ,
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.670

and parfey , oure enemys han moore nede to love than oure freendes ;
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.671

and they that moore nede have , certes to hem shal men doon goodnesse ;
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.672

and certes , in thilke dede have we remembraunce of the love of Jhesu
Crist that deyde for his enemys . CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.673

And in as muche as thilke love is the moore grevous to parfourne , so
muche is the moore gret the merite ; CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.674

and therfore <P_305.C1> the lovynge of oure enemy hath confounded the
venym of the devel . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.675

For right as the devel is disconfited by humylitee , right so is he
wounded to the deeth by love of oure enemy . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.676

Certes , thanne is love the medicine that casteth out the venym of Envye
fro mannes herte . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.677

The speces of this paas shullen be moore largely declared in hir
chapitres folwynge . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.678

<heading>

Sequitur de Ira CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.680

<$$heading>

After Envye wol I discryven the synne of Ire . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.682

For soothly , whoso hath envye upon his neighebor , anon he wole comunly
fynde hym a matere of wratthe , in word or in dede , agayns hym to whom
he hath envye . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.683

And as wel Comth Ire of Pride , as of Envye , CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.684

for soothly , he that is proud or envyous is lightly wrooth .
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.685

This synne of Ire , after the discryvyng of Seint Augustyn , is wikked
wil to been avenged by word , or by dede . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.686

Ire , after the Philosophre , is the fervent blood of man yquyked in his
herte , thurgh which he wole harm to hym that he hateth .
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.687

For certes , the herte of man , by eschawfynge and moevynge of his blood
, wexeth so trouble that he is out of alle juggement of resoun .
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.688

But ye shal understonde that Ire is in two maneres ;
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.689

that oon of hem is good , CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.690

and that oother is wikked . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.691

The goode Ire is by jalousie of goodnesse , thurgh which a man is wrooth
with wikkednesse and agayns wikkednesse ; CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.692

and therfore seith a wys man that Ire is bet than pley .
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.693

This Ire is with debonairetee , CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.694

and it is wrooth withouten bitternesse ; nat wrooth agayns the man , but
wrooth with the mysdede of the man , as seith the prophete David ,
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.695

" Irascimini et nolite peccare . " CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.696

Now understondeth that wikked Ire is in two maneres ; that is to seyn ,
sodeyn Ire or hastif Ire , withouten avisement and consentynge of resoun
. CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.697

The menyng and the sens of this is , that the resoun of a man ne
consente nat to thilke sodeyn Ire ; CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.698

and thanne is it venial . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.699

Another Ire is ful wikked , that comth of felonie of herte avysed and
cast biforn , with wikked wil to do vengeance , CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.700

and therto his resoun consenteth ; CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.701

and <P_305.C2> soothly this is deedly synne . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.702

This Ire is so displesant to God that it troubleth his hous
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.703

and chaceth the Hooly Goost out of mannes soule , CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.704

and wasteth and destroyeth the liknesse of God - that is to seyn , the
vertu that is in Mannes soule - CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.705

and put in hym the liknesse of the devel , CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.706

and bynymeth the man fro God , that is his rightful lord .
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.707

This Ire is a ful greet plesaunce to the devel , CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.708

for it is the develes fourneys , that is eschawfed with the fir of helle
. CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.709

For certes , right so as fir is moore mighty to destroyen erthely
thynges than any oother element , right so Ire is myghty to destroyen
alle spiritueel thynges . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.710

Looke how That fir of smale gleedes , that been almost dede under asshen
, wollen quike agayn whan they been touched with brymstoon ;
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.711

right so Ire wol everemo quyken agayn , whan it is touched by the pride
that is covered in mannes herte . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.712

For certes , fir ne may nat comen out of no thyng , but if it were first
in the same thyng natureely , as fir is drawen out of flyntes with steel
. CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.713

And right so as pride is ofte tyme matere of Ire , right so is rancour
norice and kepere of Ire . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.714

Ther is a maner tree , as seith Seint ysidre , that whan men maken fir
of thilke tree , and covere the coles of it with asshen , soothly the
fir of it wol lasten a yeer or moore . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.715

And right so fareth it of rancour ; CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.716

whan it is ones conceyved in the hertes of som men , certein , it wol
lasten peraventure from oon Estre day unto another Estre day , and moore
. CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.717

But certes , thilke man is ful fer fro the mercy of God al thilke while
. CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.718

in this forseyde develes fourneys ther forgen three shrewes : Pride ,
that ay bloweth and encreesseth the fir by chidynge and wikked wordes ;
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.719

thanne stant Envye CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.720

and holdeth the hoote iren upon the herte of man with a peire of longe
toonges of long rancour ; CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.721

and thanne stant the synne of Contumelie , or strif and cheeste ,
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.722

and batereth and forgeth by vileyns reprevynges .
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.723

Certes , this cursed synne annoyeth bothe to the man hymself and eek to
his neighebor . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.724

For soothly , almoost al the harm that any man dooth to his neighebor
comth of wratthe . CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.725

For certes , outrageous wratthe dooth al that evere the devel hym
comaundeth , CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.726

for he ne spareth neigher Crist ne <P_306.C1> his sweete Mooder .
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.727

And in his outrageous anger and ire - allas , allas ! - ful many oon at
that tyme feeleth in his herte ful wikkedly , bothe of Crist and eek of
alle his halwes . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.728

Is nat this a cursed vice ? CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.729

Yis , certes . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.730

Allas ! CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.731

It bynymeth from man his wit and his resoun , and al his debonaire lif
espiritueel that sholde kepen his soule . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.732

Certes , it bynymeth eek goddes due lordshipe , CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.733

and that is mannes soule , and the love of his neighebores .
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.734

It stryveth eek alday agayn trouthe . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.735

It reveth hym the quiete of his herte , CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.736

and subverteth his soule . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.737

of Ire comen thise stynkynge engendrures : First , hate , that is oold
wratthe ; discord , thurgh which a man forsaketh his olde freend that he
hath loved ful longe ; CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.738

and thanne cometh werre , and every manere of wrong that man dooth to
his neighebor , in body or in catel . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.739

Of this cursed synne of Ire cometh eek manslaughtre .
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.740

And understonde wel that homycide , that is manslaughtre , is in diverse
wise . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.741

Som manere of homycide is spiritueel , CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.742

and som is bodily . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.743

Spiritueel manslaughtre is in sixe thynges . First by hate , as seith
Seint john : CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.744

" He that hateth his brother is an homycide . " CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.745

Homycide is eek by babkbitynge , of whiche bakbiteres seith Salomon that
" they han two swerdes with whiche they sleen hire neighebores . "
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.746

For soothly , as wikke is to bynyme his good name as his lyf .
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.747

Homycide is eek in yevynge of wikked conseil by fraude , as for to yeven
conseil to areysen wrongful custumes and taillages . Of whiche seith
Salomon , " Leon rorynge and bere hongry been like to the crueel
lordshipes " in witholdynge or abreggynge of the shepe <paren> or the
hyre <$$paren> , or of the wages of sevauntz , or elles in usure , or in
withdrawynge of the almesse of povre folk . For which the wise man
seith , " Fedeth hym that almoost dyeth for honger " ;
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.748

for soothly , but if thow feede hym , thou sleest hym ;
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.749

and alle thise been deedly synnes . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.750

Bodily manslaughtre is , whan thow sleest him with thy tonge in oother
manere ; as whan thou comandest to sleen a man , or elles yevest hym
conseil to sleen a man . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.751

Manslaughtre in dede is in foure maneres . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.752

That oon is by lawe , right as a justice dampneth hym that is coupable
to the deeth . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.753

But lat the justice be war that he do it rightfully , and that he do it
nat for delit to <P_306.C2> spille blood , but for kepynge of
rightwisnesse . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.754

Another homycide is that is doon for necessitee , as whan o man sleeth
another in his defendaunt , and that he ne may noon ootherwise escape
from his owene deeth . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.755

But certeinly if he may escape withouten slaughtre of his adversarie ,
and sleeth hym , he dooth synne CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.756

and he shal bere penance as for deedly synne . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.757

Eek if a man , by caas or aventure , shete an arwe , Or caste a stoon ,
with which he sleeth a man , he is homycide . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.758

Eek if a womman by necligence overlyeth hire child in hir slepyng , it
is homycide and deedly synne . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.759

Eek whan man destourbeth concepcioun of a Child , and maketh a womman
outher bareyne By drynkynge venenouse herbes thurgh which she may nat
conceyve , or sleeth a child by Drynkes wilfully , or elles putteth
certeine material thynges in hire secree places to slee the child , or
elles dooth unkyndely synne , by which man or womman shedeth hire nature
in manere or in place ther as a child may nat be conceived , or elles if
a woman have conceyved , and hurt hirself and sleeth the child , yet is
it homycide . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.760

What seye we eek of wommen that mordren hir children for drede of
worldly shame ? CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.761

certes , an horrible homicide . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.762

Homycide is eek if a man approcheth to a womman by desir of lecherie ,
thurgh which the child is perissed , or elles smyteth a womman wityngly
, thurgh which she leseth hir child . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.763

Alle thise been homycides and horrible deedly synnes .
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.764

Yet comen ther of Ire manye mo synnes , as wel in word as in thoght and
in dede ; as he that arretteth upon God , or blameth God of thyng of
which he is hymself gilty , or despiseth God and alle his halwes , as
Doon thise cursede hasardours in diverse contrees .
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.765

This cursed synne doon they , whan they feelen in hir herte ful wikkedly
of God and of his halwes . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.766

Also whan they treten unreverently the sacrement of the auter , Thilke
synne is so greet that unnethe may it been releessed , but that the
mercy of God passeth alle his werkes ; CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.767

it is so greet , and he so benigne . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.768

Thanne comth of Ire attry angre . CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.769

whan a man is sharply amonested in his shrifte to forleten his synne ,
thanne wole he be angry , and answeren hokerly and angrily , and
<P_307.C1> deffenden or excusen his synne by unstedefastnesse of his
flessh ; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.770

or elles he dide it for to holde compaignye with his felawes ;
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.771

or elles , he seith , the feend enticed hym ; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.772

or elles he Dide it for his youthe ; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.773

or elles his compleccioun is so corageous that he may nat forbere ;
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.774

or elles it is his destinee , as he seith , unto a certein age ;
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.775

or elles , he seith , it cometh hym of gentillesse of his auncestres ;
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.776

and semblable thynges . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.777

Alle thise manere of folk so wrappen hem in hir synnes that they ne wol
nat delivere hemself . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.778

For soothly , no wight that excuseth hym wilfully of his synne may nat
been delivered of his synne , til that he mekely biknoweth his synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.779

After this , thanne cometh sweryng , that is expres agayn the
comandement of God ; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.780

and this bifalleth ofte of anger and of Ire . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.781

God seith , " Thow shalt nat take the name of thy Lord God in veyn or in
ydel . " CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.782

Also oure Lord Jhesu Crist seith , by the word of Seint Mathew , " Ne
wol ye nat swere in alle manere ; neither by hevene , for it is goddes
trone ; ne by erthe , for it is the bench of his feet ; ne by jerusalem
, for it is the citee of a greet kyng ; ne by thyn heed , for thou mayst
nat make an heer whit ne blak . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.783

But seyeth by youre word ' ye , ye , ' and ' nay , nay ' ;
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.784

and what that is moore , it is of yvel , - thus seith Crist .
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.785

For Cristes sake , ne swereth nat so synfully in dismembrynge of Crist
by soule , herte , bones , and body . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.786

For certes , it semeth that ye thynke that the cursede jewes ne
dismembred nat ynough the preciouse persone of Crist ,
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.787

but ye dismembre hym moore . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.788

And if so be that the lawe compelle yow to swere , thanne rule yow after
the lawe of God in youre sweriyng , as seith jeremye , quarto capitulo :
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.789

thou shalt kepe three condicions : CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.790

thou shalt swere " in trouthe , in doom , and in rightwisnesse . " This
is to seyn , thou shalt swere sooth ; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.791

for every lesynge is agayns Crist ; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.792

for Crist is verray trouthe . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.793

And thynk wel this , that " every greet swerere , nat compedded
lawefully to swere , the wounde shal nat departe from his hous " whil he
useth swich unleveful swerying . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.794

Thou shalt sweren eek in doom , whan thou art constreyned by thy
domesman to witnessen the trouthe . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.795

Eek thow shalt nat swere for envye , ne for favour , ne for meede , but
for rightwisnesse , for declaracioun <P_307.C2> of it , to the worshipe
of God and helpyng of thyne evene-Cristene . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.796

And therefore every man that taketh Goddes name in ydel , or falsly
swereth with his mouth , or elles taketh on hym the name of Crist , to
be called a Cristen man , and lyveth agayns Cristes lyvynge and his
techynge , alle they taken Goddes name in ydel . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.797

Looke eek what Seint Peter seith , CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.798

Actuum quarto , CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.799

Non est aliud nomen sub celo , etc. , CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.800

" Ther n@ @ys noon oother name , " seith Seint Peter , " under hevene
yeven to men , in which they mowe be saved " ; that is to seyn , but the
name of Jhesu Crist . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.801

Take kep eek how precious is the name of Crist , as seith Seint Paul ,
ad Philipenses secundo , CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.802

in nomine Jhesu , etc. , CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.803

" That in the name of Jhesu every knee of hevenely creatures , or
erthely , or of helle sholde bowe , " CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.804

for it is so heigh and so worshipful that the cursede feend in helle
sholde tremblen to heeren it ynempned . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.805

Thanne semeth it that men that sweren so horribly by his blessed name ,
that they despise it moore booldely than dide the cursede Jewes , or
elles the devel , that trembleth whan he heereth his name .
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.806

Now certes , sith that sweryng , but if it be lawefully doon , is so
heighly deffended , muche worse is forsweryng falsly , and yet nedelees
. CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.807

What seye we eek of hem that deliten hem in sweryng , and holden it a
gentrie or a manly dede to swere grete othes ? And what of hem that of
verray usage ne cesse nat to swere grete othes , al be the cause nat
worth a straw ? CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.808

Certes , this is horrible synne . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.809

Swerynge sodeynly withoute avysement is eek a Synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.810

But lat us go now to thilke horrible sweryng of adjuracioun and
conjuracioun , as doon thise false enchauntours or nigromanciens in
bacyns ful of water , or in a bright swerd , in a cercle , or in a fir ,
or in a shulderboon of a sheep . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.811

I kan nat seye but that they doon cursedly and dampnably agayns Crist
and al the feith of hooly chirche . CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.812

What seye we of hem that bileeven on divynailes , as by flight or by
noyse of briddes , or of beestes , or by sort , by nigromancie , by
dremes , by chirkynge of dores or crakkynge <P_308.C1> of houses , by
gnawynge of rattes , and swich manere wrecchednesse ?
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.813

Certes , al this thyng is deffended by God and by hooly chirche . For
which they been acursed , til they come to amendement , that on swich
filthe setten hire bileeve . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.814

Charmes for woundes or maladie of men or of beestes , if they taken any
effect , it may be peraventure that God suffreth it ,
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.815

for folk sholden yeve the moore feith and reverence to his name .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.816

Now wol I speken of lesynges , which generally is fals signyficaunce of
word , in entente to deceyven his evene-Cristene .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.817

Som lesynge is of which ther comth noon avantage to no wight ;
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.818

and som lesynge turneth to the ese and profit of o man , and to disese
and damage of another man . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.819

Another lesynge is for to saven his lyf or his catel .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.820

Another lesynge comth of delit for to lye , in which delit they wol
forge a long tale , and peynten it with alle circumstaunces , where al
the ground of the tale is fals . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.821

Som lesynge comth , for he wole sustene his word ;
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.822

and som lesynge comth of reccheleesnesse withouten avisement ;
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.823

and semblable thynges . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.824

Lat us now touche the vice of flaterynge , which ne comth nat gladly but
for drede or for coveitise . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.825

Flaterye is generally wrongful preisynge . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.826

Flatereres been the develes norices , that norissen his children with
milk losengerie . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.827

For sothe , Salomon seith that " Flaterie is wors than detraccioun . "
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.828

For somtyme detraccion maketh an hauteyn man be the moore humble ,
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.829

for he dredeth detraccion ; CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.830

but certes flaterye , that maketh a man to enhauncen his herte and his
contenance . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.831

Flatereres been the develes enchauntours ; CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.832

for they make a man to wene of hymself be lyk that he n@ @ys nat lyk .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.833

They been lyk to Judas that bitraysen a man to sellen hym to his enemy ;
that is to the devel . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.834

Flatereres been the develes chapelleyns , that syngen evere placebo .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.835

I rekene flaterie in the vices of Ire ; CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.836

for ofte tyme , if o man be wrooth with another , thanne wole he flatere
som wight to sustene hym in his querele . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.837

Speke we now of swich cursynge as comth of irous herte .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.838

Malisoun generally may be seyd every maner power of harm .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.839

Swich cursynge bireveth man fro the regne of God , as <P_308.C2> seith
Seint Paul . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.840

and ofte tyme swiche cursynge wrongfully retorneth agayn to hym that
curseth , as a bryd that retorneth agayn to his owene nest .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.841

And over alle thyng men oghten eschewe to cursen hir children , and
yeven to the devel hire engendrure , as ferforth as in hem is .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.842

Certes , it is greet peril and greet synne . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.843

Lat us thanne speken of chidynge and reproche , whiche been ful grete
woundes in mannes herte , CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.844

for they unsowen the semes of freendshipe in mannes herte .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.845

For certes , unnethes may a man pleynly been accorded with hym that hath
hym openly revyled and repreved and disclaundred .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.846

This is a ful grisly synne , as Crist seith in the gospel .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.847

And taak kep now , that he that repreveth his neighebor , outher he
repreveth hym by som harm of peyne that he hath on his body , as " mesel
, " " croked harlot , " or by som synne that he dooth .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.848

Now if he repreve hym by harm of peyne , thanne turneth the repreve to
Jhesu Crist , CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.849

for peyne is sent by the rightwys sonde of God , and by his suffrance ,
be it meselrie , or maheym , or maladie . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.850

And if he repreve hym uncharitably of synne , as " thou holour , " "
thou dronkelewe harlot , " and so forth , thanne aperteneth that to the
rejoysynge of the devel , that evere hath joyde that men doon synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.851

And certes , chidynge may nat come but out of a vileyns herte .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.852

For after the habundance of the herte speketh the mouth ful ofte .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.853

And ye shul understonde that looke , by any wey , whan any man shal
chastise another , that he be war from chidynge or reprevynge .
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.854

For trewely , but he be war , he may ful lightly quyken the fir of angre
and of wratthe , which that he sholde quenche , CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.855

and peraventure sleeth hym , which that he myghte chastise with
benignitee . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.856

For as seith Salomon , " the amyable tonge is the tree of lyf " - that
is to seyn , of lyf espiritueel - CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.857

and soothly , a deslavee tonge sleeth spirites of hym that repreveth and
eek of hym that is repreved . CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.858

loo , what seith Seint Augustyn : CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.859

" Ther is nothyng so lyk the develes child as he that ofte chideth . "
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.860

Seint Paul seith eek , " The servant of God bihoveth nat to chide . "
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.861

And how that chidynge be a vileyns thyng bitwixe alle manere folk ,
<P_309.C1> yet is it certes moost uncovenable bitwixe a man and his wyf
, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.862

for there is nevere reste . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.863

And therfore seith Salomon , " An hous that is uncovered and droppynge ,
and a chidynge wyf , been lyke . " CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.864

A man that is in a droppynge hous in manye places , though he eschewe
the droppynge in a place , it droppeth on hym in another place .
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.865

So fareth it by a chydynge wyf ; CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.866

but she chide hym in o place , she wol chide hym in another .
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.867

And therfore , " Bettre is a morsel of breed with joye than an hous ful
of delices with chidynge , " seith Salomon . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.868

Seint Paul seith , " O ye wommen , be ye subgetes to youre housbondes as
bihoveth in God , CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.869

and ye men loveth youre wyves . " CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.870

Ad Colossenses tertio . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.871

Afterward speke we of scornynge , which is a wikked synne , and namely
whan he scorneth a man for his goode werkes . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.872

For certes , swiche scorneres faren lyk the foule tode , that may nat
endure to smelle the soote savour of the vyne whanne it florissheth .
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.873

Thise scorneres been partyng felawes with the Devel ;
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.874

for they han joye whan the devel wynneth , and sorwe whan he leseth .
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.875

They been adversaries of Jhesu Crist , CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.876

for they haten that he loveth - that is to seyn , salvacioun of soule .
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.877

speke we now of wikked conseil , CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.878

for he that wikked conseil yeveth is a traytour .
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.879

For he deceyveth hym that trusteth in hym , ut Achitofel ad Absolonem .
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.880

But nathelees , yet is his wikked conseil first agayn hymself .
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.881

for , as seith the wise man , " Every fals lyvynge hath this propertee
in hymself , that he that wole anoye another man , he anoyeth first
hymself . " CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.882

And men shul understonde that man shal nat taken his conseil of fals
folk , ne of angry folk , or grevous folk , ne of folk that loven
specially to muchel hir owene profit , ne to muche worldly folk , namely
in conseilynge of soules . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.883

Now comth the synne of hem that sowen and maken discord amounges folk ,
which is a synne that Crist hateth outrely . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.884

And no wonder is , CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.885

for he deyde for to make concord . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.886

And moore shame do they to Crist , than dide they that hym crucifiede ,
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.887

for God loveth bettre that <P_309.C2> freendshipe be amonges folk , than
he dide his owene body , the which that he yaf for unitee .
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.888

Therfore been they likned to the devel , that evere is aboute to maken
discord . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.889

Now comth the synne of double tonge , swiche as speken faire byforn folk
, and wikkedly bihynde , CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.890

or elles they maken semblant as though they speeke of good entencioun ,
or Elles in game and pley , CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.891

and yet they speke of wikked entente . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.892

Now comth biwreying of conseil , thurgh which a man is defamed ;
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.893

certes , unnethe may he restoore the damage . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.894

Now comth manace , that is an open folye , CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.895

for he that ofte manaceth , he threteth moore than he may parfourne ful
ofte tyme . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.896

Now cometh ydel wordes , that is withouten profit of hym that speketh
tho wordes , and eek of hym that herkneth tho wordes .
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.897

Or elles ydel wordes been tho that been nedelees , or withouten entente
of natureel profit . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.898

And al be it that ydel wordes been somtyme venial synne , yet sholde men
douten hem , CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.899

for we shul yeve rekenynge of hem bifore God . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.900

Now comth janglynge , that may nat been withoute synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.901

And , as seith Salomon , " It is a sygne of apert folye . "
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.902

And therfore a philosophre seyde , whan men axed hym how that men sholde
plese the peple , CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.903

and he answerde , " Do manye goode werkes , CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.904

and spek fewe jangles . " CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.905

After this comth the synne of japeres , that been the develes apes ,
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.906

for they maken folk to laughe at hire japerie as folk doon at the gawdes
of an ape . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.907

swiche japes deffendeth Seint Paul . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.908

looke how that vertuouse wordes and hooly conforten hem that travaillen
in the service of Crist , CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.909

right so conforten the vileyns wordes and knakkes of japeris hem that
travaillen in the service of the devel . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.910

Thise been the synnes that comen of the tonge that comen of Ire and of
othere synnes mo . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.911

<heading>

Sequitur remedium contra peccatum Ire . CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.913

<$$heading>

The remedie agayns Ire is a vertu that men clepen mansuetude , that is
debonairette ; and <P_310.C1> eek another vertu , that men callen
pacience or suffrance . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.915

Debonairetee withdraweth and refreyneth the stirynges and the moevynges
of mannes corage in his herte , in swich manere that they ne skippe nat
out by angre ne by ire . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.916

Suffrance suffreth swetely alle the anoyaunces And the wronges that men
doon to man outward . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.917

Seint Jerome seith thus of debonairetee , that " it dooth noon harm to
no wight ne seith ; CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.918

ne for noon harm that men doon or seyn , he ne eschawfeth nat agayns his
resoun . " CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.919

This vertu somtyme comth of nature , CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.920

for , as seith the Philosophre , " A man is a quyk thyng , by nature
debonaire and tretable to goodnesse ; CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.921

but whan debonairetee is enformed of grace , thanne is it the moore
worth . " CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.922

Pacience , that is another remedie agayns Ire , is a vertu that suffreth
swetely every mannes goodnesse , and is nat wrooth for noon harm that is
doon to hym . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.923

The Philosophre seith that pacience is thilke vertu that suffreth
debonairely alle the outrages of adversitee and every wikked word .
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.924

This vertu maketh a man lyk to God , CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.925

and maketh hym Goddes owene deere child , as seith Crist .
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.926

This vertu disconfiteth thyn enemy . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.927

And therfore seith the wise man , " If thow wolt venquysse thyn enemy ,
lerne to suffre . " CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.928

And thou shalt understonde that man suffreth foure manere of grevances
in outward thynges , agayns the whiche foure he moot have foure manere
of paciences . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.929

The firste grevance is of wikkede wordes . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.930

Thilke suffrede Jhesu Crist withouten grucchyng , ful paciently , whan
the jewes despised and repreved hym ful ofte . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.931

suffre thou therfore paciently ; CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.932

for the wise man seith , " If thou stryve with a fool , though the fool
be wrooth or though he laughe , algate thou shalt have no reste . "
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.933

That oother grevance outward is to have damage of thy catel .
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.934

Theragayns suffred Crist ful paciently , whan he was despoyled of al
that he hadde in this lyf , CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.935

and that n@ @as but his clothes . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.936

The thridde grevance is a man to have harm in his body .
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.937

That suffred Crist ful paciently in al his passioun .
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.938

The fourthe grevance is in outrageous labour in werkes . wherfore I
seye that folk that maken <P_310.C2> hir servantz to travaillen to
grevously , or out of tyme , as on haly dayes , soothly they do greet
synne . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.939

Heer-agayns suffred Crist ful paciently CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.940

and taughte us pacience , whan he baar upon his blissed shulder the
croys upon which he sholde suffren despitous deeth .
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.941

Heere may men lerne to be pacient , CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.942

for certes noght oonly Cristen men been pacient , for love of Jhesu
Crist , and for gerdoun of the blisful lyf that is perdurable ,
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.943

but certes , the olde payens that nevere were Cristene , commendeden and
useden the vertu of pacience . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.944

A philosophre upon a tyme , that wolde have beten his disciple for his
grete trespas , for which he was greetly amoeved , broghte a yerde to
scoure with the child ; CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.945

and whan this child saugh the yerde , he seyde to his maister , " What
thenke ye do ? " CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.946

" I wol bete thee , " quod the maister , " for thy correccioun . "
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.947

" For sothe , " quod the child , " ye oghten first correcte youreself ,
that han lost al youre pacience for the gilt of a child . "
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.948

" For sothe , " quod the maister al wepynge , " thow seyst sooth . "
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.949

" Have thow the yerde , my deere sone , CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.950

and correcte me for myn impacience . " CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.951

of pacience comth obedience , thurgh which a man is obedient to Crist
and to alle hem to whiche he oghte to been obedient in Crist .
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.952

And understond wel that obedience is perfit , whan that a man dooth
gladly and hastily , with good herte entierly , al that he sholde do .
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.953

Obedience generally is to parfourne the doctrine of God and of his
sovereyns , to whiche hym oghte to ben obeisaunt in alle rightwisnesse .

Sequitur de Accidia . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.956

<$$heading>

After the synne of Envye and of Ire , now Wol I speken of the synne of
Accidie . CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.958

For Envye blyndeth the herte of a man , CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.959

and Ire troubleth a man , CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.960

and Accidie maketh hym hevy , thoghtful , and wraw .
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.961

Envye and Ire maken bitternesse in herte , which bitternesse is mooder
of Accidie , and bynymeth hym the love of alle goodnesse .
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.962

Thanne is Accidie the angwissh of troubled herte ;
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.963

and Seint Augustyn seith , " It is anoy of goodnesse and ioye of harm .
" CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.964

Certes , this is a dampnable synne , CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.965

For it dooth wrong to Jhesu Crist , in as muche <P_311.C1> as it
bynymeth the service that men oghte doon to Crist with alle diligence ,
as seith Salomon . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.966

But Accidie dooth no swich diligence . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.967

He dooth alle thyng with anoy , and with wrawnesse , slaknesse , and
excusacioun , and with ydelnesse , and unlust ; for which the book seith
, " Acursed be he that dooth the service of God necligently . "
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.968

thanne is Accidie enemy to everich estaat of man ,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.969

for certes , the estaat of man is in three maneres .
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.970

Outher it is th'@ @estaat of innocence , as was th'@ @estaat of adam
biforn that he fil into synne ; in which estaat he was holden to wirche
as in heriynge and adowrynge of God . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.971

Another estaat is the estaat of synful men , in which estaat men been
holden to laboure in preiynge to God for amendement of hire synnes , and
that he wole graunte hem to arysen out of hir synnes .
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.972

Another estaat is th'@ @estaat of grace , in which estaat he is holden
to werkes of penitence . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.973

And certes , to alle thise thynges is Accidie enemy and contrarie ,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.974

for he loveth no bisynesse at al . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.975

Now certes this foule synne Accidie , is eek a ful greet enemy to the
liflode of the body , CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.976

for it ne hath no purveaunce agayn temporeel necessitee ,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.977

for it forsleweth and forsluggeth and destroyeth alle goodes temporeles
by reccheleesnesse . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.978

The fourthe thyng is that accidie is lyk hem that been in the peyne of
helle , by cause of hir slouthe and of hire hevynesse ,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.979

for they that been dampned been so bounde that they ne may neither wel
do ne wel thynke . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.980

Of Accidie comth first , that a man is anoyed and encombred for to doon
any goodnesse , and maketh that God hath abhomynacion of swich Accidie ,
as seith Seint john . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.981

Now comth Slouthe , that wol nat suffre noon hardnesse ne no penaunce .
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.982

For soothly , Slouthe is so tendre and so delicaat , as seith Salomon ,
that he wol nat suffre noon hardnesse ne penaunce ,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.983

and therfore he shendeth al that he dooth . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.984

Agayns this roten-herted synne of Accidie and Slouthe sholde men
exercise hemself to doon goode werkes , and manly and vertuously cacchen
corage wel to doon , thynkynge that oure Lord Jhesu Crist quiteth every
good dede , be it never so lite . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.985

Usage of labour is <P_311.C2> a greet thyng , CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.986

for it maketh , as seith Seint bernard , the laborer to have stronge
armes and harde synwes ; CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.987

and slouthe maketh hem feble and tendre . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.988

Thanne comth drede to bigynne to werke anye goode werkes .
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.989

For certes , he that is enclyned to synne , hym thynketh it is so greet
an emprise for to undertake to doon werkes of goodnesse ,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.990

and casteth in his herte that the circumstances of goodnesse been so
grevouse and so chargeaunt for to suffre , that he dar nat undertake to
do werkes of goodnesse , as seith Seint Gregorie .
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.991

Now comth wanhope , that is despeir of the mercy of God , that comth
somtyme of to muche outrageous sorwe , and somtyme of to muche drede ,
ymaginynge that he hath doon so muche synne that it wol nat availlen hym
, though he wolde repenten hym and forsake synne , thurgh which despeir
or drede he abaundoneth al his herte to every maner synne , as seith
Seint augustin . Which dampnable synne , if that it continue unto his
ende , it is cleped synnyng in the Hooly Goost . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.992

This horrible synne is so perilous that he that is despeired , ther n@
@ys no felonye ne no synne that he douteth for to do ; as shewed wel by
judas . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.993

Certes , aboven alle synnes thanne is this synne moost displesant to
Crist , and moost adversarie . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.994

Soothly , he that despeireth hym is lyk the coward champioun recreant ,
that seith , " creant " withoute nede , CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.995

Allas , Allas , nedeles is he recreant and nedelees despeired .
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.996

Certes , the mercy of God is evere redy to the penitent ,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.997

and is aboven alle his werkes . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.998

Allas , kan a man nat bithynke hym on the gospel of Seint luc , 15 ,
where as Crist seith that " as wel shal ther be joye in hevene upon a
synful man that dooth penitence , as upon nynty_and_nyne Rightful men
that neden no penitence . " CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.999

Looke forther , in the same gospel , the joye And the feeste of the
goode man that hadde lost his sone , whan his sone with repentaunce was
retourned to his fader . CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.1000

Kan they nat remembren hem eek that , as seith Seint luc , 23 , how that
the theef that was hanged bisyde Jhesu Crist , seyde , " Lord , remembre
of me , whan thow comest into thy regne " ? CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.1001

" For sothe , " seyde Crist , " I seye to thee , to-day shal@ @tow been
with me in paradys . " CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.1002

Certes , <P_312.C1> ther is noon so horrible synne of man that it ne may
in his lyf be destroyed by penitence , thurgh vertu of the passion and
of the deeth of Crist . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1003

Allas , what nedeth man thanne to been despeired , sith that his mercy
so redy is and large ? CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1004

Axe and have . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1005

Thanne cometh sompnolence , that is , sloggy slombrynge , which maketh a
man be hevy and dul in body and in soule , CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1006

and this synne comth of Slouthe . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1007

And certes , the tyme that , by wey of resoun , men sholde nat slepe ,
that is by the morwe , but if ther were cause resonable .
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1008

For soothly , the morwe tyde is moost covenable a man to seye his
preyeres , and for to thynken on God , and for to honoure God , and to
yeven almesse to the povre that first cometh in the name of Crist .
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1009

Lo , what seith Salomon : CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1010

" Whoso wolde by the morwe awaken and seke me , he shal fynde . "
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1011

Thanne cometh necligence , or reccheleesnesse , that rekketh of no thyng
. CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1012

And how that ignoraunce be mooder of alle harm , certes , necligence is
the norice . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1013

Necligence ne dooth no fors , whan he shal doon a thyng , wheither he do
it weel or baddely . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1014

Of the remedie of thise two synnes , as seith the wise man , that " He
that dredeth God , he spareth nat to doon that him oghte doon . "
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1015

And he that loveth God , he wol doon diligence to plese God by his
werkes , and abaundone hymself , with al his myght , wel for to doon .
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1016

Thanne comth ydelnesse , that is the yate of alle harmes .
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1017

An ydel man is lyk to a place that hath no walles ;
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1018

the develes may entre on every syde , or sheten at hym at discovert , by
temptacion on every syde . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1019

This ydelnesse is the thurrok of alle wikked and vileyns thoghtes , and
of alle jangles , trufles , and of alle ordure .
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1020

Certes , the hevene is yeven to hem that wol labouren , and nat to ydel
folk . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1021

Eek David seith that " they ne been nat in the labour of men ,
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1022

ne they shul nat been whipped with men " - that is to seyn , in
purgatorie . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1023

Certes , thanne semeth it they shul be tormented with the devel in helle
, but if they doon penitence . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1024

Thanne comth the synne that men clepen tarditas , as whan a man is to
laterede or tariynge er he wole turne to God , CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1025

and certes , that is a greet folie . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1026

He is lyk to hym that falleth in the dych , and wol nat arise .
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1027

And this vice <P_312.C2> comth of a fals hope , that he thynketh that he
shal lyve longe ; CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1028

but that hope faileth ful ofte . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1029

Thanne comth lachesse ; CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1030

that is he , that Whan he biginneth any good werk , anon he shal
forleten it and stynten ; as doon they that han any wight to governe ,
and ne taken of hym namoore kep , anon as they fynden any contrarie or
any anoy . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1031

Thise been the newe sheepherdes that leten hir sheep wityngly go renne
to the wolf that is in the breres , or do no fors of hir owene
governaunce . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1032

Of this comth poverte and destruccioun , bothe of spiritueel and
temporeel thynges . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1033

Thanne comth a manere cooldnesse , that freseth al the herte of a man .
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1034

Thanne comth undevoccioun , thurgh which a man is so blent , as seith
Seint Bernard , and hath swich languour in soule that he may neither
rede ne singe in hooly chirche , ne heere ne thynke of no devoioun , ne
travaille with his handes in no good werk , that it n@ @ys hym unsavory
and al apalled . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1035

Thanne wexeth he slough and slombry , CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1036

and soone wol be wrooth , CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1037

and soone is enclyned to hate and to envye . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1038

Thanne comth the synne of worldly sorwe , swich as is cleped tristicia ,
that sleeth man , as seith Seint Paul . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1039

For certes , swich sorwe werketh to the deeth of the soule and of the
body also ; CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1040

for therof comth that a man is anoyed of his owene lif . Wherfore swich
sorwe shorteth ful ofte the lif of man , er that his tyme be come by wey
of kynde . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1041

<heading>

Remedium contra peccatum Accidie . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1043

<$$heading>

Agayns this horrible synne of Accidie , an the branches of the same ,
ther is a vertu that is called fortitudo or strentthe , that is an
affeccioun thurgh which a man despiseth anoyouse thinges .
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1045

This vertu is so myghty and so vigerous that it dar withstonde myghtily
and wisely kepen hymself fro perils that been wikked , and wrastle agayn
the assautes of the devel . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1046

For It enhaunceth and enforceth the soule , right as Accidie abateth it
and maketh it fieble . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1047

For this fortitudo may endure by long suffraunce the travailles that
been covenable . CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1048

This vertu hath manye speces ; CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1049

and the firste is cleped magnanimitee , that is to seyn , <P_313.C1>
greet corage . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1050

For certes , ther bihoveth greet corage agains Accidie , lest that it ne
swolwe the soule by the synne of sorwe , or destroye it by wanhope .
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1051

This vertu maketh folk to undertake harde thynges and grevouse thynges ,
by hir owene wil , wisely and resonably . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1052

And for as muchel as the devel fighteth agayns a man moore by queyntise
and by sleighte than by strengthe , therfore men shal withstonden hym by
wit and by resoun and by discrecioun . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1053

Thanne arn ther the vertues of feith and hope in God and in his seintes
, to acheve and acomplice the goode werkes in the whiche he purposeth
fermely to continue . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1054

Thanne comth seuretee or sikernesse ; CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1055

and that is whan a man ne douteth no travaille in tyme comynge of the
goode werkes that a man hath bigonne . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1056

Thanne comth magnificence , that is to seyn , whan a man dooth and
parfourneth grete werkes of goodnesse ; CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1057

and that is the ende why that men sholde do goode werkes ,
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1058

for in the acomplissynge of grete goode werkes lith the grete gerdoun .
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1059

Thanne is ther constaunce , that is , stablenesse of corage ,
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1060

and this sholde been in herte by stedefast feith , and in mouth , and in
berynge , and in chiere , and in dede . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1061

Eke ther been mo speciale remedies against Accidie in diverse werkes ,
and in consideracioun of the peynes of helle and of the joyes of hevene
, and in the trust of the grace of the Holy Goost , that wole yeve hym
myght to parfourne his goode entente . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1062

Sequitur de Avaricia . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1064

<$$heading>

After Accidie wol I speke of Avarice and of Coveitise , of which synne
seith Seint Paul that " the roote of alle harmes is Coveitise . "
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1066

Ad Thimotheum Sexto . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1067

For soothly , whan the herte of a man is confounded in itself and
troubled , and that the soule hath lost the confort of God , thanne
seketh he an ydel solas of worldly thynges . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1068

Avarice , after the descripcioun of Seint Augustyn , is a likerousnesse
in herte to have erthely thynges . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1069

Som oother folk seyn that Avarice is for to purchacen manye erthely
thynges , and no thyng yeve to hem that han nede .
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1070

And understoond that Avarice ne stant nat oonly in lond ne catel , but
somtyme in science and in glorie , CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1071

and in every manere of outrageous thyng is Avarice and Coveitise .
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1072

<P_313.C2>

And the difference bitwixe Avarice and Coveitise is this :
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1074

Coveitise is for to coveite swiche thynges as thou hast nat ;
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1075

and Avarice is for to withholde and kepe swiche thynges as thou hast ,
withoute rightful nede . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1076

Soothly , this Avarice is a synne that is ful dampnable ,
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1077

for al hooly writ curseth it , CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1078

and speketh agayns that vice ; CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1079

for it dooth wrong to Jhesu Crist . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1080

for it bireveth hym the love that men to hym owen ,
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1081

and turneth it bakward agayns alle resoun , CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1082

and maketh that the avaricious man hath moore hope in his catel than in
Jhesu Crist , and dooth moore observance in kepynge of his tresor than
he dooth to the service of Jhesu Crist . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1083

and therfore seith Seint Paul Ad Ephesios quinto , that an avaricious
man is in the thraldom of ydolatrie . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1084

what difference is bitwixe an ydolastre and an avaricious man , but that
an ydolastre , per_aventure , ne hath but o mawmet or two , and the
avaricious man hath manye ? CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1085

For certes , every floryn in his cofre is his mawmet .
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1086

And certes , the synne of mawmettrie is the firste thyng that God
deffended in the ten comaundementz as bereth witnesse in Exodi capitulo
vicesimo : CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1087

" Thou shalt have no false goddes bifore me , CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1088

ne thou shalt make to thee no grave thyng . " CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1089

Thus is an avaricious man , that loveth his tresor biforn God , an
ydolastre , thurgh this cursed synne of avarice .
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1090

Of Coveitise comen thise harde lordshipes , thurgh whiche men been
distreyned by taylages , custumes , and cariages , moore than hire
duetee or resoun is . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1091

And eek taken they of hire bonde-men amercimentz , whiche myghten moore
resonably ben cleped extorcions than amercimentz . Of whiche
amercimentz and raunsonynge of boonde-men somme lordes stywards seyn
that it is ryghtful , for as muche as a cherl hath no temporeel thyng
that it ne is his lordes , as they seyn . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1092

But certes , thise lordshipes doon wrong that bireven hire bondefolk
thynges that they nevere yave hem . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1093

Augustinus , De Civitate libro nono . CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1094

" Sooth is that the condicioun of thraldom and the firste <P_314.C1>
cause of thraldom is for synne . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1095

Genesis nono . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1096

Thus may ye seen that the gilt disserveth thraldom , but nat nature . "
Wherfore thise lordes ne sholde nat muche glorifien hem in hir
lordshipes , sith that by natureel condicion they been nat lordes over
thralles , but that thraldom comth first by the desert of synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1097

And forther_over , ther as the lawe seith that temporeel goodes of
boonde-folk been the goodes of hir lordeshipes , ye , that is for to
understonde , the goodes of the emperour , to deffenden hem in hir right
, but nat for to robben hem ne reven hem . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1098

And therfore seith seneca , " Thy prudence sholde lyve benignely with
thy thralles . " CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1099

Thilke that thou clepest thy thralles been goddes peple ,

Thynk eek that of swich seed as cherles spryngen , of swich seed

As wel may the cherl be saved as the lord . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1104

the same deeth that taketh the cherl , swich deeth taketh the lord .
Wherfore I rede , do right so with the cherl , as thou woldest that thy

CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1105

Every synful man is a cherl to synne . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1106

I rede thee , certes , that thou , Lord , werke in swich wise with thy
cherles that they rather love thee than drede . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1107

I woot wel ther is degree above degree , as reson is ,
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1108

and skile is that men do hir devoir ther as it is due ,
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1109

but certes , extorcions and despit of youre underlynges is dampnable .
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1110

And forther_over , understoond wel that thise conquerours or tirauntz
maken ful ofte thralles of hem that been born of as roial blood as been
they that hem conqueren . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1111

this name of thraldom was nevere erst kowth , til that noe seyde that

What seye we thanne of hem that pilen and doon extorcions to hooly
chirche ? CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1113

Certes , the swerd that men yeven first to a knyght , whan he is newe
dubbed , signifieth that he sholde deffenden hooly chirche , and nat
robben it ne pilen it ; CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1114

and whoso dooth is traitour to Crist . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1115

And , as seith Seint Augustyn , " They been the develes wolves that
stranglen the sheep of Jhesu Crist , " CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1116

and doon worse than wolves . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1117

<P_314.C2>

For soothly , whan the wolf hath ful his wombe , he styntheth to
strangle sheep . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1119

But soothly , the pilours and destroyours of the godes of hooly chirche
no do nat so , CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1120

for they ne stynte nevere to pile . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1121

Now as I have seyd , sith so is that synne was first cause of thraldom ,
thanne is it thus , that thilke tyme that al this world was in synne ,
thanne was al this world in thraldom and subjeccioun .
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1122

But certes , sith the time of grace cam , God ordeyned that som folk
sholde be moore heigh in estaat and in degree , and som folk moore lough
, and that everich sholde be served in his estaat and in his degree .
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1123

And therfore in somme contrees , ther they byen thralles , whan they han
turned hem to the feith , they maken hire thralles free out of thraldom
. CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1124

And therfore , certes , the Lord oweth to his man that the man oweth to
his lord . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1125

The Pope calleth hymself servant of the servantz of God ;
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1126

but for as muche as the estaat of hooly chirche ne myghte nat han be ,
Ne the commune profit myghte nat han be kept , ne pees and rest in erthe
, but if God hadde ordeyned that som men hadde hyer degree and som men
lower , therfore was sovereyntee ordeyned , to kepe and mayntene and
deffenden hire underlynges or hire subgetz in resoun , as ferforth as it
lith in hire power , and nat to destroyen hem ne confounde . wherfore I
seye that thilke lordes that been lyk wolves , that devouren the
possessiouns or the catel of povre folk wrongfully , withouten mercy or
mesure , They shul receyven , by the same mesure that they han mesured
to povre folk , the mercy of Jhesu Crist , but if it be amended .
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1127

now comth deciete bitwixe marchaunt and marchant .
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1128

And thow shalt understonde that marchandise is in manye maneres ;
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1129

that oon is bodily , CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1130

and that oother is goostly ; CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1131

that oon is honest and leveful , CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1132

and that oother is deshonest and unleveful . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1133

of thilke bodily marchandise that is leveful and honest is this : that ,
there as God hath ordeyned that a regne or a contree is suffisaunt to
hymself , thanne is it honest and leveful that of habundaunce of this
contree , that men helpe another contree that is moore needy .
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1134

And therfore ther moote been marchantz to bryngen fro that o contree to
that oother hire marchandises . CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1135

That oother marchandise , that men haunten with fraude and <P_315.C1>
trecherie and deceite , with lesynges and false othes , is cursed and
dampnable . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1136

Espiritueel marchandise is proprely symonue , that is , ententif desir
to byen thyng espiritueel , that is , thyng that aperteneth to the
seintuarie of God and to cure of the soule . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1137

this desir , if so be that a man do his diligence to parfournen it , al
be it that his desir ne take noon effect , yet is it to hym a deedly
synne ; CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1138

and if he be ordred , he is irreguleer . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1139

Certes symonye is cleped of simon magus , that wolde han boght for
temporeel catel the yifte that God hadde yeven , by the Hooly Goost , to
Seint Peter and to the apostles . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1140

And therfore understoond that bothe he that selleth and he that beyeth
thynges espirituels been cleped symonyals , be it by catel , be it by
procurynge , or by flesshly preyere of his freendes , flesshly freendes
, or espiritueel freendes : CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1141

Flesshly in two maneres ; as by kynrede , or othere freendes .
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1142

Soothly , if they praye for hym that is nat worthy and able , it is
symonye , if he take the benefice ; CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1143

and if he be worthy and able , ther n@ @ys noon .
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1144

that oother manere is whan men or wommen preyen for folk to avauncen hem
, oonly for wikked flesshly affeccioun that they han unto the persone ,
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1145

and that is foul symonye . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1146

But certes , in service , for which men yeven thynges espirituels unto
hir servauntz , it moot been understonde that the service moot been
honest , and elles nat ; and eek that it be withouten bargaynynge , and
that the persone be able . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1147

For , as seith Seint Damasie , " Alle the synnes of the world , at
regard of this synne , arn as thyng of noght . "
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1148

For it is the gretteste synne that may be , after the synne of lucifer
and anteCrist . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1149

For by this synne God forleseth the chirche and the soule that he boghte
with his precious blood , by hem that yeven chirches to hem that been
nat digne . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1150

For they putten in theves that stelen the soules of Jhesu Crist and
destroyen his patrimoyne . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1151

by swiche undigne preestes and curates han lewed men the lasse reverence
of the sacramentz of hooly chirche ; CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1152

and <P_315.C2> swiche yeveres of chirches putten out the children of
Crist CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1153

and putten into the chirche the develes owene sone .
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1154

They sellen the soules that lambes sholde kepen to the wolf that
strangleth hem . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1155

And therfore shul they nevere han part of the pasture of lambes , that
is the blisse of hevene . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1156

Now comth hasardrie with his Apurtenaunces , as tables and rafles , of
which comth deceite , false othes , chidynges , and alle ravynes ,
blasphemynge and reneiynge of God , and hate of his neighebores , wast
of goodes , mysspendynge of tyme , and somtyme manslaughtre .
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1157

Certes , hasardours ne mowe nat been withouten greet synne whiles they
haunte that craft . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1158

Of Avarice comen eek lesynges , thefte , fals witnesse , and false othes
. CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1159

And ye shul understonde that thise been grete synnes and expres agayn
the comaundementz of God , as I have seyd . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1160

Fals witnesse is in word and eek in dede . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1161

In word , as for to bireve thy neighebores goode name by thy fals
witnessyng , or bireven hym his catel or his heritage by thy fals
witnessyng , whan thou for ire , or for meede , or for envye , berest
fals Witnesse , or accusest hym or excusest hym by thy fals witnesse ,
or elles excusest thyself falsly . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1162

ware yow , questemongeres and notaries ! CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1163

Certes , for fals witnessyng was Susanna in ful gret sorwe and peyne ,
and many another mo . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1164

The synne of thefte is eek expres agayns goddes heeste , and that in two
maneres , corporeel or spiritueel . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1165

Corporeel , as for to take thy neighebores catel agayn his wyl , be it
by force or by sleighte , be it by met or by mesure ; by stelyng eek of
false enditementz upon hym , and in borwynge of thy neighebores catel ,
in entente nevere to payen it agayn , and semblable thynges .
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1166

Espiritueel thefte is sacrilege ; that is to seyn , hurtynge of hooly
thynges , or of thynges sacred to Crist , in two maneres : by reson of
the hooly place , as chirches or chirche-hawes , for which every vileyns
synne that men doon in swiche places may be cleped sacrilege , or every
violence in the semblable places ; CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1167

also , they that withdrawen falsly the rightes that longen to hooly
chirche . CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1168

And pleynly and generally , sacrilege <P_316.C1> is to reven hooly thyng
fro hooly place , or unhooly thyng out of hooly place , or hooly thing
out of unhooly place . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1169

Relevacio contra peccatum Avaricie . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1171

<$$heading>

Now shul ye understonde that the releevynge of Avarice is misericorde ,
and pitee largely taken . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1173

And men myghten axe why that misericorde and pitee is releevynge of
Avarice . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1174

Certes , the avricious man sheweth no pitee ne misericorde to the
nedeful man , CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1175

for he deliteth hym in the kepynge of his tresor , and nat in the
rescowynge ne releevynge of his evene-Cristen . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1176

And therfore speke I first of misericorde . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1177

Thanne is misericorde , as seith the Philosophre , a vertu by which the
corage of a man is stired by the mysese of hym that is mysesed . Upon
which misericorde folweth pitee in parfournynge of charitable werkes of
misericorde . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1178

And certes , thise thynges moeven a man to the misericorde of Jhesu
Crist , that he yaf hymself for oure gilt , and suffred deeth for
misericorde , and forgaf us oure originale synnes , and therby relessed
us fro the peynes of helle , and amenused the peynes of purgatorie by
penitence , and yeveth grace wel to do , and at@ @te laste the blisse of
hevene . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1179

the speces of misericorde been , as for to lene and for to yeve , and to
foryeven and relesse , and for to han pitee in herte And compassioun of
the meschief of his evene-Cristene , and eek to chastise , there as nede
is . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1180

another manere of remedie agayns Avarice is resonable largesse ;
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1181

but soothly , heere bihoveth the consideracioun of the grace of Jhesu
Crist , and of his temporeel goodes , And eek of the goodes perdurables
, that Crist yaf to us ; and to han remembrance of the deeth that he
shal receyve , he n@ @oot whanne , where , ne how ; and eek that he shal
forgon al that he hath , save oonly that he hath despended in goode
werkes . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1182

But for as muche as som folk been unmesurable , men oghten eschue
fool-largesse , that men clepen wast . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1183

Certes , he that is fool-large ne yeveth nat his catel ,
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1184

but he leseth his catel . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1185

Soothly , what thyng that he yeveth for veyne glorie , as to mynstrals
and to folk , for to beren his renoun in the world , he hath synne
therof , <P_316.C2> and noon almesse . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1186

Certes , he leseth foule his good , that ne seketh with the yifte of his
good nothyng but synne . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1187

He is lyk to an hors that seketh rather to drynken drovy or trouble
water than for to drynken water of the clere welle .
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1188

and for as muchel as they yeven ther as they sholde nat yeven , to hem
aperteneth thilke malisoun that Crist shal yeven at the day of doom to

After Avarice comth Glotonye , which is expres eek agayn the comandement
of God . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1193

Glotonye is unmesurable appetit to ete or to drynke , or elles to doon
ynogh to the unmesurable appetit and desordeynee coveitise to eten or to
drynke . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1194

This synne corrumped al this world , as is wel shewed in the synne of
Adam and of Eve . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1195

Looke eek what seith Seint Paul , of Glotonye : CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1196

" Manye , " seith Seint Paul , " goon , of whiche I have ofte seyd to

Crist ; of whiche the ende is deeth , and of whiche hire wombe is hire
God , and hire glorie in confusioun of hem that so savouren erthely
thynges . " CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1197

He that is usaunt to this synne of glotonye , he ne may no synne
withstonde . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1198

He moot been in servage of alle vices , CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1199

for it is the develes hoord ther he hideth hym and resteth .
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1200

This synne hath manye speces . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1201

The firste is dronkenesse , that is the horrible sepulture of mannes
resoun ; CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1202

and therfore , whan a man is dronken , he hath lost his resoun ;
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1203

and this is deedly synne . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1204

But soothly , whan that a man is nat wont to strong drynke , and
peraventure ne knoweth nat the strengthe of the drynke , or hath
feblesse in his heed , or hath travailed , thurgh which he drynketh the
moore , al be he sodeynly caught with drynke , it is no deedly synne ,
but venyal . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1205

The seconde spece of glotonye is that the spirit of a man wexeth al
trouble , CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1206

For dronkenesse bireveth hym the discrecioun of his wit .
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1207

The thridde spece of glotonye is whan a man devoureth his mete , and
hath no rightful manere of etynge . CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1208

The fourthe is whan , Thurgh the grete habundaunce of his mete ,
<P_317.C1> the humours in his body been distempred .
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1209

The fifthe is foryetelnesse by to muchel drynkynge ; for which somtymee
a man foryeteth er the morwe what he dide at even , or on the nyght
biforn . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1210

In oother manere been distinct the speces of glotonye , after Seint
Gregorie . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1211

The firste is for to ete biforn tyme to ete . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1212

The seconde is whan a man get hym to delicaat mete or drynke .
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1213

The thridde is whan men taken to muche over mesure .
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1214

The fourthe is curiositee , with greet entente to maken and apparaillen
his mete . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1215

The fifthe is for to eten to gredily . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1216

Remedium contra peccatum Gule . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1219

Agayns Glotonye is the remedie abstinence , as seith galien ;

but that holde I nat meritorie , if he do it oonly for the heele of his
body . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1222

Seint Augustyn wole that abstinence be doon for vertu and with pacience
. CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1223

" Abstinence , " he seith , " is litel worth , but if a man have good
wil therto , and but it be enforced by pacience and by charitee , and
that men doon it for Godes sake , and in hope to have the blisse of
hevene . " CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1224

The felawes of abstinence been attemperaunce , that holdeth the meene in
alle thynges ; eek shame , that aschueth alle deshonestee ; surfisance ,
that seketh no riche metes ne drynkes , ne dooth no fors of to
outrageous appariailynge of mete ; mesure also , that restreyneth by
resoun the deslavee appetit of etynge ; sobrenesse also , that
restreyneth the outrage of drynke ; sparynge also , that restreyneth the
delacaat ese to sitte longe at his mete and softely , wherfore some folk

God woot , this Synne is ful displesaunt thyng to God ,
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1231

for he seyde hymself , " Do no lecherie . " CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1232

And therfore he putte grete peynes agayns this synne in the olde lawe .
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1233

If womman thral were taken in this synne , she sholde be beten with
staves to the deeth ; CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1234

and if she were a gentil womman , she sholde be slayn with stones ;
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1235

and if she were a bisshoppes doghter , she sholde been brent , by Goddes
comandement . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1236

Forther_over , by the synne of lecherie God dreynte al the world at the

And after that he brente fyve citees with thonder-leyt ,
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1238

and sank hem into helle . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1239

Now lat us speke thanne of thilke stynkynge synne of lecherie that men
clepe avowtrie of wedded folk ; that is to seyn , if that oon of hem be
wedded , or elles bothe . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1240

Seint John seith that avowtiers shullen been in helle , in a stank
brennynge of fyr and of brymston - in fyr for hire lecherye , in
brymston for the stynk of hire ordure . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1241

Certes , the brekynge of this sacrement is an horrible thyng .
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1242

It was maked of God hymself in paradys , and confermed by Jhesu Crist ,
as witnesseth Seint Mathew in the gospel : CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1243

" A man shal lete fader and mooder , and taken hym to his wif ,
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1244

and they shullen be two in o flesh . " CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1245

This sacrement bitokneth the knyttynge togidre of Crist and of hooly
chirche . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1246

And nat oonly that God forbad avowtrie in dede , CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1247

but eek he comanded that thou sholdest nat coveite thy neighebores wyf .
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1248

" In this heeste , " seith Seint Augustyn , " is forboden alle manere

Lo , what seith Seint Mathew in the gospel , that " whose seeth a womman
to coveitise of his lust , he hath doon lecherie with hire in his herte
. " CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1250

Heere may ye seen that nat oonly the dede of this synne is forboden ,
but eek the desire to doon that synne . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1251

This cursed synne anoyeth grevousliche hem that it haunten . And first

for he obligeth it to synne and to peyne of deeth that is perdurable .
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1253

Unto the body anoyeth it grevously also , CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1254

for it dreyeth hym , CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1255

and wasteth him , CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1256

and shent hym , CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1257

and of his blood he maketh sacrifice to the feend of helle .
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1258

It wasteth eek his catel and his substaunce . CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1259

And certes , if it be a foul thyng a man to waste his catel on wommen ,
yet is it a fouler thyng whan that , for <P_318.C1> swich ordure ,
wommen dispenden upon men hir catel and substaunce .

for therby wynneth he the mooste partie of this world .
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1263

And right as a marchant deliteth hym moost in chaffare that he hath
moost avantage of , right so deliteth the fend in this ordure .
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1264

This is that oother hand of the devel with fyve fyngres to cacche the

The firste fynger is the fool lookynge of the fool womman and of the

that sleeth , right as the basilicok sleeth folk by the venym of his

for the coveitise of eyen folweth the coveitise of the herte .
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1268

The seconde fynger is the vileyns touchynge in wikkede manere .

And therfore seith Salomon that " whoso toucheth and handleth a womman ,

brenneth the herte . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1271

The fourthe fynger is the kissynge ; CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1272

and trewely he were a greet fool that wolde kisse the mouth of a
brennynge oven or of a fourneys . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1273

And moore fooles been they that kissen in vileynye ,
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1274

for that mouth is the mouth of helle ; CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1275

and namely thise olde dotardes holours , yet wol they kisse , though
they may nat do , and smatre hem . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1276

Certes , they been lyk to houndes ; CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1277

for an hound , whan he comth by the roser or by othere $bushes , though
he may nat pisse , yet wole he heve up his leg and make a contenaunce to
pisse . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1278

And for that many man weneth that he may nat synne , for no
likerousnesse that he dooth with his wyf , CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1279

certes , that opinion is fals . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1280

God woot , a man may sleen hymself with his owene knyf , and make
hymselve dronken of his owene tonne . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1281

Certes , be it wyf , be it child , or any worldly thyng that he loveth
biforn God , it is his mawmet , CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1282

and he is an ydolastre . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1283

man sholde loven hys wyf by Discrecioun , paciently and atemprely ,
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1284

and thanne is she as though it were his suster .
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1285

The fifthe fynger of the develes hand is the stynkynge <P_318.C2> dede
of Leccherie . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1286

Certes , the fyve fyngres of Glotonie the feend put in the wombe of a
man , CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1287

and with his fyve fingres of Lecherie he gripeth hym by the reynes , for
to throwen hym into the fourneys of helle , ther as they shul han the
fyr and the wormes that evere shul lasten , and wepynge and wailynge
sharp hunger and thurst , $and grymnesse of develes , that shullen al
totrede hem without repit and withouten ende . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1288

Of Leccherie , as I seyde , sourden diverse speces , as fornicacioun ,
that is bitwixe man and womman that been nat maried ,
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1289

and this is deedly synne , and agayns nature . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1290

Al that is enemy and destruccioun to nature is agayns nature .
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1291

Parfay , the resoun of a man telleth eek hym wel that it is deedly synne
, for as muche as God forbad leccherie . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1292

And Seint Paul yeveth hem the regne that n@ @ys dewe to no wight but to
hem that doon deedly synne . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1293

Another synne of leccherie is to bireve a mayden of hir maydenhede ,
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1294

for he that so dooth , certes , he casteth a mayden out of the hyeste
degree that is in this present lif CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1295

and bireveth hir thilke percious fruyt that the book clepeth the hundred
fruyt . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1296

I ne kan seye it noon oother-wewyes in englissh ,
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1297

but in Latyn it highte Centesimus fructus . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1298

Certes , he that so dooth is cause of manye damages and vileynyes , mo
than any man kan rekene ; right as he somtyme is cause of alle damages
that beestes don in the feeld , that breketh the hegge or the closure ,
thurgh which he destroyeth that may nat been restoored .
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1299

For certes , namoore may maydenhede be restoored than a arm that is
smyten fro the body may retourne agayn to wexe .
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1300

She may have mercy , this woot I wel , if she do penitence ;
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1301

but nevere shal it be that She n@ @as corrupt . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1302

And al be it so that I have spoken somwhat of avowtrie , it is good to
shewen mo perils that longen to avowtrie , for to eschue that foule
synne . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1303

Avowtrie in latyn is for to seyn , approchynge of oother mannes bed ,
thurgh which tho that whilom weren a flessh abowndone hir bodyes to
othere persones . CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1304

Of this synne , as seith the wise man , folwen manye harmes .
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1305

First , brekynge of feith , CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1306

<P_319.C1>

and certes , in feith is the keye of Cristendom .
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1308

And whan that feith is broken and lorn , soothly Cristendom stant veyn
and withouten fruyt . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1309

This synne is eek a thefte , CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1310

for thefte generally is for to reve a wight his thyng agayns his wille .
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1311

Certes , this is the fouleste thefte that may be , whan a womman steleth
hir body from hir housbonde And yeveth it to hire holour to defoulen
hire , and steleth hir soule fro Crist and yeveth it to the devel .
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1312

This is a fouler thefte than for to breke a chirche and stele the
chalice , CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1313

for thise avowtiers breken the temple of God spiritually ,
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1314

and stelen the vessel of grace , that is the body And the soule , for
which Crist shal destroyen hem , as seith Seint Paul .
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1315

Soothly , of this thefte douted gretly Joseph , whan that his lordes wyf
preyed hym of vileynye , whan he seyde , " Lo , my lady , how my lord
hath take to me under my warde al that he hath in this world , ne no
thyng of his thynges is out of My power , but oonly ye , that been his
wyf . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1316

And how sholde I thanne do this wikkednesse , and synne so horribly
agayns God and agayns my lord ? CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1317

God it forbeede ! " CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1318

Allas , al to litel is swich trouthe now yfounde .
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1319

The thridde harm is the filthe thurgh which they breken the comandement
of God , and defoulen the auctour of matrimoyne , that is Crist .
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1320

For certes , in so muche as the sacrement of mariage is so noble and so
digne , so muche is it gretter synne for to breken it ,
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1321

for God made mariage in paradys , in the estaat of innocence , to
multiplye mankynde to the service of God . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1322

And therfore is the brekynge therof the moore grevous ; of which
brekynge comen false heires ofte tyme , that wrongfully ocupien folkes
heritages . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1323

And therfore wol Crist putte hem out of the regne of hevene , that is
heritage to goode folk . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1324

Of this brekynge comth eek ofte tyme that folk unwar wedden or synnen
with hire owene kynrede , and namely thilke harlotes that haunten
bordels of thise fool wommen , that mowe be likned to a commune gong ,
where as men purgen hire ordure . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1325

What seve we eek of putours that lyven by the horrible synne of putrie ,
and constreyne wommen to yelden hem a certeyn rente of hire bodily
puterie , ye , <P_319.C2> somtyme of his owene wyf or his child , as
Doon thise bawdes ? CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1326

Certes , thise been cursede synnes . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1327

Understoond eek that Avowtrie is set gladly in the ten comandementz
bitwixe thefte and manslaughtre ; CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1328

for it is the gretteste thefte that may be , CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1329

for it is thefte of body and of soule . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1330

And it is lyk to homycide , CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1331

for it kerveth atwo and breketh atwo hem that first were maked o flessh
. CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1332

And therfore , by the olde lawe of God , they sholde be slayn .
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1333

But nathelees , by the lawe of Jhesu Crist , that is lawe of pitee ,
whan he seyde to the womman that was founden in avowtrie , and sholde
han been slayn with stones , after the wyl of the jewes , as was hir
lawe , " Go , quod Jhesu Crist , " and have namoore wyl to synne , " or
, " wille namoore to do synne . " Soothly the vengeaunce of Avowtrie is
awarded to the peynes of helle , but if so be that it be destourbed by
penitence . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1334

Yet been ther mo speces of this cursed synne ; as whan that oon of hem
is religious , or elles bothe ; or of folk that been entred into ordre ,
as subdekne , or dekne , or preest , or hospitaliers .
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1335

And evere the hyer that he is in ordre , the gretter is the synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1336

The thynges that gretly agreggen hire synne is the brekynge of hire avow
of chastitee , whan they receyved the ordre . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1337

And forther_over , sooth is that hooly ordre is chief of al the tresorie
of God , and his especial signe and mark of chastitee , to shewe that
they been joyned to chastitee , which that is the moost precious lyf
that is . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1338

And thise ordred folk been specially titled to God , and of the special
meignee of God , for which , whan they doon deedly synne , they been the
special traytours of God and of his peple ; CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1339

for they lyven of the peple , to preye for the peple ,
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1340

and while they been suche traitours , here preyer avayleth nat to the
peple . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1341

Preestes been aungels , as by the dignitee of hir mysterye ;
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1342

but for sothe , Seint Paul seith that Sathanas transformeth hym in an
aungel of light . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1343

Soothly , the preest that haunteth deedly synne , he may be likned to
the aungel of derknesse transformed in the aungel of light .
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1344

He semeth aungel of light , CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1345

but for sothe he is aungel of derknesse . CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1346

Swiche preestes been the sones of Helie , as sheweth <P_320.C1> in the
Book of Kynges , that they weren the sones of Belial - that is , the
devel . CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1347

Belial is to seyn , " withouten juge . " CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1348

And so faren they ; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1349

hem thynketh they been free , and han no juge , namoore than hath a free
bole that taketh which cow that hym liketh in the town .
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1350

So faren they by wommen . CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1351

For right as a free bole is ynough for al a toun , right so is a wikked
preest corrupcioun ynough for al a parisshe , or for al a contree .
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1352

Thise preestes , as seith the book , ne konne nat the mysterie of
preesthod to the peple , CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1353

ne God ne knowe they nat . CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1354

They ne helde hem nat apayd , as seith the book , of soden flessh that
was to hem offred , CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1355

but they tooke by force the flessh that is rawe .
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1356

Certes , so thise shrewes ne holden hem nat apayed of roosted flessh and
sode flessh , with which the peple feden hem in greet reverence ,
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1357

but they wole have raw flessh of folkes wyves and hir doghtres .
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1358

And certes , thise wommen that consenten to hire harlotrie doon greet
wrong to Crist , and to hooly chirche , and alle halwes , and to alle
soules ; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1359

for they bireven alle thise hym that sholde worshipe Crist and hooly
chirche , and preye for Cristene soules . CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1360

And therfore han swiche preestes , and hire lemmanes eek that consenten
to hir leccherie , the malisoun of al the court Cristien , til they come
to amendement . CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1361

The thridde spece of avowtrie is somtyme bitwixe a man and his wyf ,
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1362

and that is whan they take no reward in hire assemblynge but oonly to
hire flesshly delit , as seith Seint jerome , and ne rekken of nothyng
but that they been assembled ; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1363

by cause that they been maried , al is good ynough , as thynketh to hem
. CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1364

But in swich folk hath the devel power , as seyde the aungel Raphael to
thobie , CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1365

for in hire assemblynge they putten Jhesu Crist out of hire herte ,
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1366

and yeven hemself to alle ordure . CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1367

The fourthe spece is the assemblee of hem that been of hire kynrede , or
of hem that been of oon affynytee , or elles with hem with whiche hir
fadres or hir kynrede han deled in the synne of lecherie .
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1368

This synne maketh hem lyk to houndes , <P_320.C2> that taken no kep to
kynrede . CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1369

And certes , parentele is in two maneres , outher goostly or flesshly ;
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1370

goostly , as for to deelen with his god-sibbes .
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1371

For right so as he that engendreth a child is his flesshly fader , right
so is his god-fader his fader espiritueel . for which a womman may in
no lasse synne assemblen with hire godsib than with hire owene flesshly
brother . CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1372

The fifthe spece is thilke abhomynable synne , of which that no man
unnethe oghte speke ne write ; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1373

nathelees it is openly reherced in holy writ . CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1374

This cursednesse doon men and wommen in diverse entente and in diverse
manere ; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1375

but though that hooly writ speke of horrible synne , certes hooly writ
may nat been defouled , namoore than the sonne that shyneth on the mixne
. CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1376

Another synne aperteneth to leccherie , that comth in slepynge ,
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1377

and this synne cometh ofte to hem that been maydenes , and eek to hem
that been corrupt ; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1378

and this synne men clepen polucioun , that comth in foure maneres .
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1379

somtyme of langwissynge of body , for the humours been to ranke and to
habundaunt in the body of man ; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1380

somtyme of infermetee , for the fieblesse of the vertu retentif , as
phisik maketh mencion ; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1381

somtyme for surfeet of mete and drynke ; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1382

and somtyme of vileyns thoghtes that been enclosed in mannes mynde whan
he gooth to slepe , which may nat been withoute synne ; for which men
moste kepen hem wisely , or elles may men synnen ful grevously .
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1383

<heading>

Remedium contra peccatum Luxurie . CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1385

<$$heading>

Now comth the remedie agayns Leccherie , CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1387

and that is generally chastitee and continence , that restreyneth alle
the desordeynee moevynges that comen of flesshly talentes .
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1388

And evere the gretter merite shal He han , that moost restreyneth the
wikkede eschawfynges of the $ardour of this synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1389

And this is in two maneres - that is to seyn , chastitee in mariage ,
and chastitee of widwehod . CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1390

Now shal@ @tow understonde that matrimoyne is leefful assemblynge of man
and of womman that receyven by vertu of the sacrement <P_321.C1> the
boond thurgh which they may nat be departed in al hir lyf - that is to
seyn , whil that they lyven bothe . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1391

This , as seith the book , is a ful greet sacrement .
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1392

God maked it , as I have seyd , in paradys , CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1393

and wolde hymself be born in mariage . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1394

And for to halwen mariage he was at a weddynge , where as he turned
water into wyn ; which was the firste miracle that he wroghte in erthe
biforn his disciples . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1395

Trewe effect of mariage clenseth fornicacioun CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1396

and replenysseth hooly chirche of good lynage , CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1397

for that is the ende of mariage ; CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1398

and it chaungeth deedly synne into venial synne bitwixe hem that been
ywedded , CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1399

and maketh the hertes al oon of hem that been ywedded , as wel as the
bodies . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1400

This is verray mariage , that was establissed by God , er that synne
bigan , whan natureel lawe was in his right poynt in paradys ;
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1401

and it was ordeyned that o man sholde have but o womman , and o womman
but o man , As seith Seint Augustyn , by manye resouns .
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1402

First , for mariage is figured bitwixe Crist And holy chirche .
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1403

And that oother is for a man is heved of a womman ;
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1404

algate , by ordinaunce it sholde be so . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1405

For if a womman hadde mo men than oon , thanne sholde she have moo
hevedes than oon , CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1406

and that were an horrible thyng biforn God ; CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1407

and eek a womman ne myghte nat plese to many folk at oones .
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1408

And also ther ne sholde nevere be pees ne reste amonges hem ,
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1409

for everich wolde axen his owene thyng . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1410

And forther_over , no man ne sholde knowe his owene engendrure , ne who
sholde have his heritage ; CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1411

and the womman sholde been the lasse biloved fro the tyme that she were
conjoynt to many men . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1412

Now comth how that a man sholde bere hym with his wif , and namely in
two thynges ; that is to seyn , in suffraunce and reverence , as shewed
Crist whan he made first womman . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1413

For he ne made hire nat of the heved of adam , CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1414

for she sholde nat clayme to greet lordshipe . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1415

For ther as the womman hath the maistrie , she maketh to muche desray .
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1416

Ther neden none ensamples of this ; CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1417

the experience of day by day oghte suffise . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1418

Also , certes , God ne made nat womman of the foot of adam ,
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1419

for she ne sholde nat <P_321.C2> been holden to lowe ;
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1420

for she kan nat paciently suffre . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1421

But God made womman of the ryb of Adam , CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1422

for womman sholde be felawe unto man . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1423

man sholde bere hym to his wyf in feith , in trouthe , and in love ,
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1424

as seith Seint Paul , that a man sholde loven his wyf as Crist loved
hooly chirche , that loved it so wel that he deyde for it .
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1425

So sholde a man for his wyf , if it were nede . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1426

Now how that a womman sholde be subget to hire housbonde , that telleth
Seint Peter . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1427

First , in obedience . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1428

And eek as seith the decree , a womman that is wyf , as longe as she is
a wyf , she hath noon auctoritee to swere ne to bere witnesse withoute
leve of hir housbonde , that is hire Lord ; CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1429

algate , he sholde be so by resoun . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1430

She sholde eek serven hym in alle honestee , and been attempree of hire
array . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1431

I woot wel that they sholde setten hire entente to plesen hir housbondes
, but nat By hire queyntise of array . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1432

Seint dJjerome seith that " wyves that been apparailled in silk And in
precious purpre ne mowe nat clothen Hem in Jhesu Crist . "
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1433

Loke what seith Seint John eek in thys matere ? CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1434

Seint Gregorie eek seith that " No wight seketh precious array but oonly
for veyne glorie , to been honoured the moore biforn the peple . "
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1435

It is a greet folye , a womman to have a fair array outward and in
hirself be foul inward . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1436

A wyf sholde eek be mesurable in lookynge and in berynge and in
lawghynge , and discreet in alle hire wordes and hire dedes .
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1437

And aboven alle worldy thyng she sholde loven hire houbonde with al hire
herte , and to hym be trewe of hir body . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1438

So sholde an housbonde eek be to his wyf . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1439

For sith that al the body is the housbondes , so sholde hire herte been
, CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1440

or elles ther is bitwixe hem two , as in that , no parfit mariage .
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1441

Thanne shal men understonde that for thre thynges a man and his wyf
flesshly mowen assemble . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1442

The firste is in entente of engendrure of children to the service of God
, CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1443

for certes that is the cause final of matrimoyne .
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1444

Another cause is to yelden everich of hem to oother the dette of hire
bodies , CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1445

for neither of hem hath power of his owene body .
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1446

The thridde is for to eschewe leccherye and vileynye .
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1447

The ferthe is for sothe deedly synne . CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1448

As to the firste , it is <P_322.C1> mertorie ; the seconde also ,
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1449

for , as seith the decree , that she hath merite of chastitee that
yeldeth to hire housbonde the dette of hir body , ye , though it be
agayn hir likynge and the lust of hire herte . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1450

The thridde manere is venyal synne ; CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1451

and , trewely , scarsly may ther any of thise be withoute venial synne ,
for the corrupcion and for the delit . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1452

The fourthe manere is for to understonde , as if they assemble oonly for
amorous love and for noon of the foreseyde causes , but for to
accomplice thilke brennynge delit , they rekke nevere how ofte .
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1453

Soothly it is deedly synne ; CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1454

and yet , with sorwe , somme folk wol peynen hem moore to doon than to
hire appetit suffiseth . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1455

The seconde manere of chastitee is for to been a clene wydewe , and
eschue the embracynges of man , and desiren the embracynge of Jhesu
Crist . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1456

Thise been tho that han been wyves and han forgoon hire housbondes , and
eek wommen that han doon leccherie and been releeved by penitence .
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1457

And certes , if that a wyf koude kepen hire al chaast by licence of hir
housbonde , so that she yeve nevere noon occasion that he agilte , it
were to hire a greet merite . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1458

Thise manere wommen that observen chastitee moste be clene in herte as
wel as in body and in thought , and mesurable in clothynge and in
contenaunce , And been abstinent in etynge and drynkynge , in spekynge ,
and in dede . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1459

They been the vessel or the boyste of the blissed magdelene , that
fulfilleth hooly chirche of good odour . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1460

The thridde manere of chastitee is virginitee , CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1461

and it bihoveth that she be hooly in herte and clene of body .
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1462

Thanne is she spouse to Jhesu Crist , CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1463

And she is the lyf of angeles . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1464

She is the preisynge of this world , CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1465

and she is as thise martirs in egalitee ; CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1466

she hath in hire that tonge may nat telle ne herte thynke .
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1467

Virginitee baar oure Lord Jhesu Crist , CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1468

and virgine was hymselve . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1469

Another remedie agayns Leccherie is specially to withdrawen swiche
thynges as yeve occasion to thilke vileynye , as ese , etynge , and
drynkynge . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1470

For certes , whan the pot boyleth strongly , the beste remedie is to
withdrawe the fyr . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1471

Slepynge longe in greet quiete is eek a greet norice to Leccherie .
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1472

<P_322.C2>

Another remedie agayns Leccherie is that a man or a womman eschue the
compaignye of hem by whiche he douteth to be tempted ,
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1474

for al be it so that the dede be withstonden , yet is ther greet
temptacioun . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1475

Soothly , a whit wal , although it ne brenne noght fully by stikynge of
a candele , yet is the wal blak of the leyt . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1476

Ful ofte tyme I rede that no man truste in his owene perfeccioun , but
he be stronger than Sampson , and hoolier than David , and wiser than
Salomon . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1477

Now after that I have declared yow , as I kan , the sevene deedly synnes
, and somme of hire braunches and hire remedies , soothly , if I koude ,
I wolde telle yow the ten comandementz . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1478

but so heigh a doctrine I lete to divines . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1479

Nathelees , I hope to God , they been touched in this tretice , everich
of hem alle . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1480

<heading>

Sequitur secunda pars Penitencie . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1482

<$$heading>

Now for as muche as the seconde partie of Penitence stant in confessioun
of mouth , as I bigan in the firste chapitre , I seye , Seint Augustyn
seith , " Synne is every word and every dede , and al that men coveiten
, agayn the lawe of Jhesu Crist ; CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1484

and this is for to synne in herte , in mouth , and in dede , by thy fyve
wittes , that been sighte , herynge , smellynge , tastynge or savourynge
, and feelynge . " CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1485

Now is it good to understonde the circumstances that agreggen muchel
every synne . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1486

Thou shalt considere what thow art that doost the synne , wheither thou
be male or femele , Yong or oold , gentil or thral , free or servant ,
hool or syk , wedded or sengle , ordred or unordred , wys or fool ,
clerk or seculeer ; if she be of thy kynrded , bodily or goostly , or
noon ; if any of thy kynrede have synned with hire , or noon ; and manye
mo thinges . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1487

Another circumstaunce is this : wheither it be doon in fornicacioun or
in avowtrie or noon ; incest or noon ; mayden or noon ; in manere of
homicide or noon ; horrible grete synnes or smale ; and how longe thou
hast continued in synne . CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1488

The thridde circumstaunce is the place ther thou hast do synne ;
wheither in oother mennes hous or in thyn owene ; in feeld Or in chirche
or in chirchehawe ; in chirche <P_323.C1> dedicaat or noon .
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1489

For if the chirche be halwed , and man or womman spille his kynde inwith
that place , by wey or synne or by wikked temptacioun , the chirche is
entredited til it be reconsiled by the bysshop .
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1490

And The preest sholde be enterdited that dide swich a vileynye ;
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1491

to terme of al his lif he sholde namoore synge masse ,
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1492

and if he dide , he sholde doon deedly synne at every time that he so
songe masse . CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1493

The fourthe circumstaunce is by whiche mediatours , or by whiche
messagers , as for enticement , or for consentement to bere compaignye
with felaweshipe ; CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1494

for many a wrecche , for to bere compaignye , wol go to the devel of
helle . Wherfore they that eggen or consenten to the synne been
parteners of the synne , and of the dampnacioun of the synnere .
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1495

The fifthe circumstaunce is how manye tymes that he hath synned , if it
be in his mynde , and how ofte that he hath falle .
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1496

For he that ofte falleth in synne , he despiseth the mercy of God ,
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1497

and encreesseth hys synne , CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1498

and is unkynde to Crist ; CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1499

and he wexeth the moore fieble to withstonde synne ,
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1500

and synneth the moore lightly , CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1501

and the latter ariseth , CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1502

and is the moore eschew for to shryven hym , and namely , to hym that is
his confessour . For which that folk , whan they falle agayn in hir
olde folies , outher they forleten hir olde confessours al outrely , or
eles they departen hir shrift in diverse places ;
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1503

but soothly , swich departed shrift deserveth no mercy of God of his
synnes . CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1504

The sixte sircumstaunce is why that a man synneth , as by which
temptacioun ; and if hymself procure thilke temptacioun , or by the
excitynge of oother folk ; or if he synne with a womman by force , or by
hire owene assent ; of if the womman , maugree hir hed , hath been
afforced , or noon . CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1505

This shal she telle : for coveitise , or for poverte , and if it was
hire procurynge , or noon ; and swich manere harneys .
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1506

The seventhe circumstaunce is in what manere he hath doon his synne , or
how that she hath suffred that folk han doon to hire .
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1507

And the same shal the man telle pleynly with alle circumstaunces ; and
<P_323.C2> wheither he hath synned with comune bordel wommen , or noon ,
or doon his synne in hooly tymes , or noon , in fastyng tymes , or noon
, or biforn his shrifte , or after his latter shrifte , and hath
peraventure broken therfore his penance enjoyned , by whos help and whos
conseil ; by sorcerie or craft ; CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1508

al moste be toold . CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1509

Alle thise thynges , after that they been grete or smale , engreggen the
conscience of man . CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1510

And eek the preest , that is thy juge , may the bettre been avysed of
his juggement in yevynge of thy penaunce , CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1511

and that is after thy contricioun . CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1512

For understond wel that after tyme that a man hath defouled his baptesme
by synne , if he wole come to salvacioun , ther is noon other wey but by
penitence and shrifte and satisfaccioun ; and namely by the two , if
ther be a confessour to which he may shriven hym , and the thridde , if
he have lyf to parfournen it . CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1513

Thanne shal man looke and considere that if he wole maken a trewe and a
profitable confessioun , ther moste be foure condiciouns .
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1514

First , it moot been in sorweful bitternesse of herte , as seyde the
kyng Ezechias to God , CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1515

" I wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lif in bitternesse of myn herte
. " CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1516

This condicioun of bitternesse hath fyve signes .
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1517

The firste is that confessioun moste be shamefast , nat for to coyere ne
hyden his synne , for he hath agilt his God and defouled his soule .
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1518

And herof seith Seint Augustyn , " The herte tavailleth for shame of his
synne " ; CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1519

and for he hath greet shamefastnesse , he is digne to have greet mercy
of God . CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1520

Swich was the confessioun of the publican that wolde nat heven up his
eyen to hevene , CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1521

for he hadde offended God of hevene ; for which shamefastnesse he hadde
anon the mercy of God . CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1522

And therof seith Seint Augustyn that swich shamefast folk been next
foryevenesse and remissioun . CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1523

Another signe is humylitee in confessioun , of which seith Seint Peter ,
" Humbleth yow under the myght of God . " CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1524

The hond of God is myghty in confessioun , CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1525

for therby God foryeveth thee thy synnes , CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1526

for he allone hath the power . CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1527

And this humylitee shal been in herte , and in signe outward ,
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1528

for right as he hath humylitee to God in his herte , right so sholde he
<P_324.C1> humble his body outward to the preest , that sit in goddes
place . For which in no manere , sith that Crist is sovereyn , and the
preest meene and mediatour bitwixe Crist and the synnere , and the
synnere is the laste by wey of resoun , thanne sholde nat the synnere
sitte as heighe as his confessour , but knele biforn hym or at his feet
, but if maladie destourbe it . CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1529

For he shal nat taken kep who sit there , but in whos place that he
sitteth . CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1530

a man that hath trespased to a lord , and comth for to axe mercy and
maken his accord , and set him doun anon by the Lord , men wolde holden
hym outrageous , and nat worthy so soone for to have remissioun ne mercy
. CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1531

The thridde signe is how that thy shrift sholde Be ful of teeris , if
man may , CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1532

and if man may nat wepe with his bodily eyen , lat hym wepe in herte .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1533

Swich was the confession of Seint Peter , CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1534

for after that he hadde forsake Jhesu Crist , he wente out
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1535

and weep ful bitterly . CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1536

The fourthe signe is that he ne lette nat for shame to shewen his
confessioun . CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1537

Swich was the confessioun of the Magdalene , that ne spared , for no
shame of hem that weren at@ @te feeste , for to go to oure Lord Jhesu
Crist and biknowe to hym hire synne . CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1538

The fifthe signe is that a man or a womman be obeisant to receyven the
penaunce that hym is enjoyned for his synnes , CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1539

for certes , Jhesu Crist , for the giltes of o man , was obedient to the
deeth . CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1540

The seconde condicion of verray confession is that it be hastily doon .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1541

For certes , if a man hadde a deedly wounde , evere the lenger that he
taried to warisshe hymself , the moore wolde it corrupte and haste hym
to his deeth , CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1542

and eek the wounde wolde be the wors for to heele .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1543

And right so fareth synne that longe tyme is in a man unshewed .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1544

Certes , a man Oghte hastily shewen his synnes for manye causes ; as for
drede of deeth , that cometh ofte sodeynly , and no certeyn what tyme it
shal be , ne in what place ; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1545

and eek the drecchynge of o synne draweth in another ;
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1546

and eek the lenger that he tarieth , the ferther he is fro Crist .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1547

And if he abide to his laste day , scarsly may he shryven hym or
remembre hym of his synnes or repenten hym , for the grevous maladie of
his deeth . CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1548

And for as muche as he <P_324.C2> ne hath nat in his lyf herkned Jhesu
Crist whanne he hath spoken , he shal crie to Jhesu Crist at his laste
day , CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1549

and scarsly wol he herkne hym . CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1550

And understond that this condicioun moste han foure thunges .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1551

Thi shrift moste be purveyed bifore and avysed ; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1552

for wikked haste dooth no profit ; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1553

and that a man konne shryve hym of his synnes , be it of pride , or of
envye , and so forth with the speces and circumstances ; and that he
have comprehended in hys mynde the nombre and the greetnesse of his
synnes , and how longe that he hath leyn in synne ; and eek that he be
contrit of his synnes , and in stidefast purpos , by the grace of God ,
nevere eft to falle in synne ; and eek that he drede and countrewaite
hymself , that he fle the occasiouns of synne to whiche he is enclyned .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1554

Also thou shalt shryve thee of alle thy synnes to o man , and nat a
parcel to o man and a parcel to another ; that is to understonde , in
entente to departe thy confessioun , as for shame of drede ,
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1555

for it n@ @ys but stranglynge of thy soule . CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1556

For certes Jhesu Crist is entierly al good ; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1557

in hym n@ @ys noon imperfeccioun , CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1558

and therfore Outher he foryeveth al parfitly or never a deel .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1559

I seye nat that if thow be assigned to the penitauncer for certein synne
, that thow art bounde to shewen hym al the remenaunt of thy synnes , of
whiche thow hast be shryven of thy curaat , but if it like to thee of
thyn humylitee ; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1560

this is no departynge of shrifte . CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1561

Ne I seye nat , ther as I speke of divisioun of confessioun , that if
thou have licence for to shryve thee to a discreet and an honest preest
, where thee liketh , and by licence of thy curaat , that thow ne mayst
wel shryve thee to him of al alle thy synnes . CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1562

But lat no blotte be bihynde ; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1563

lat no synne been untoold , as fer as thow hast remembraunce .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1564

And whan thou shalt be shryven to thy curaat , telle hym eek alle the
synnes that thow hast doon syn thou were last yshryven ;
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1565

this is no wikked entente of divisioun of shrifte .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1566

Also the verray shrifte axeth certeine condiciouns .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1567

First , that thow shryve thee by thy free wil , noght constreyned , ne
for shame of folk , ne for maladie , ne swich thynges .
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1568

For <P_325.C1a> it is resoun that he that trespaseth by his free wyl ,
that by his free wyl he confesse his trespas , and that noon oother man
telle his synne but he hymself ; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1569

ne he shal nat nayte ne denye his synne , ne wratthe hym agayn the
preest for his amonestynge to lete synne . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1570

The seconde condicioun is that thy shrift be laweful , That is to seyn ,
that thow that shryvest thee , and eek the preest that hereth thy
confessioun , been verraily in the feith of hooly chirche ; and that a
man ne be nat despeired of the mercy of Jhesu Crist , as Caym or Judas .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1571

And eek a man moot accusen hymself of his owene trespas , and nat
another ; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1572

but he shal blame and wyten hymself and his owene malice of his synne ,
and noon oother . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1573

But nathelees , if that another man be occasioun or enticere of his
synne , or the estaat of a persone be swich thurgh which his synne is
agregged , or elles that he may nat pleynly shryven hym but he telle the
persone with which he hath synned , thanne may he telle it , so that his
entente ne be nat to bakbite the persone , but oonly to declaren his
confessioun . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1574

Thou ne shalt nat eek make no lesynges in Thy confessioun , for
humylitee , peraventure , to seyn that thou hast doon synnes of whiche
thow were nevere gilty . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1575

For Seint Augustyn seith , " If thou , by cause of thyn hymylitee ,
makest lesynges on thyself , though thow ne <P_325.C2a> were nat in
synne biforn , yet ar@ @tow thanne in synne thurgh thy lesynges . "
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1576

Thou most eek shewe thy synne by thyn owene propre mouth , but thow be
woxe dowmb , and nat by no lettre ; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1577

for thow that hast doon the synne , thou shalt have the shame therfore .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1578

Thow shalt nat eek peynte thy confessioun by faire subtile wordes , to
covere the moore thy synne ; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1579

for thanne bigiles@ @tow thyself , and nat the preest .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1580

Thow most tellen it platly , be it nevere so foul ne so horrible .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1581

Thow shalt eek shryve thee to a preest that is discreet to conseille
thee ; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1582

and eek thou shalt nat shryve thee for veyne glorie , ne for ypocrisye ,
ne for no cause but oonly for the doute of Jhesu Crist and the heele of
thy soule . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1583

Thow shalt nat eek renne to the preest sodeynly to tellen hym lightly
thy synne , as whoso telleth a jape or a tale , but avysely and with
greet devocioun . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1584

And generally , shryve thee ofte . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1585

If thou ofte falle , ofte thou arise by confessioun .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1586

And though thou shryve thee ofter than ones of synne of which thou hast
be shryven , it is the moore merite . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1587

And , as seith Seint Augustyn , thow shalt have the moore lightly
relessyng and grace of God , bothe of synne and of peyne .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1588

And certes , oones a yeere at@ @te leeste wey it is laweful for to been
housled , CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1589

for certes , oones a yeere alle thynges renovellen .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1590

Now have I toold yow of verray Confessioun , that is the seconde partie
of Penitence . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1591

<heading>

Explicit secunda pars Penitencie , et sequitur tercia pars eiusdem .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1593

<$$heading>

<P_325.C1b>

The thridde partie of Penitence is Satisfaccioun ,
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1596

and that stant moost generally in almesse and in bodily peyne .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1597

Now been ther thre manere of almesse : contricion of herte , where a man
offreth hymself to God ; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1598

another is to han pitee of defaute of his neighebores ;
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1599

and the thridde is in yevynge of good conseil and comfort , goostly and
bodily , where men han nede , and namely in sustenaunce of mannes foode
. CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1600

And tak kep that a man hath nede of thise thinges generally :
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1601

he hath nede of foode , CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1602

he hath nede of clothyng and herberwe , CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1603

he hath nede of charitable conseil and visitynge in prisone and in
maladie , and sepulture of his dede body . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1604

<P_325.C2b>

And if thow mayst nat visite the nedeful with thy persone , visite hym
by thy message and by thy yiftes . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2b.1606

Thise been general almesses or werkes of charitee of hem that han
temporeel richesses or discrecioun in conseilynge .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2b.1607

Of thise werkes shal@ @tow heren at the day of doom .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2b.1608

Thise almesses shal@ @tow doon of thyne owene propre thynges , and
hastily and prively , if thow mayst . CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2b.1609

But nathelees , if thow mayst nat doon it prively , thow shalt nat
forbere to doon almesse though men seen it , so that it be nat doon for
thank of the world , but Oonly for thank of Jhesu Crist .
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2b.1610

For , as witnesseth Seint Mathew , capitulo quinto , <P_326.C1> " A
citee may nat been hyd that is set on a dmMontayne ,
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1611

ne men lighte nat a lanterne CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1612

and put it under a busshel , CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1613

but men sette it on a candle-stikke to yeve light to the men in the hous
. CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1614

Right so shal youre light lighten bifore men , that they may seen youre
goode werkes , And glorifie youre fader that is in hevene . "
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1615

Now as to speken of bodily peyne , it stant in preyeres , in wakynges ,
in fastynges , in vertuouse techynges of orisouns .
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1616

And ye shul understonde that orisouns or preyeres is for to seyn a
pitous wyl of herte , that redresseth it in God and expresseth it by
word outward , to remoeven harmes and to han thynges espiritueel and
durable , and somtyme temporele thynges ; of whiche orisouns , certes ,
in the orison of the Pater noster hath Jhesu Crist enclosed moost
thynges . CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1617

Certes , it is privyleged of thre thynges in his dignytee , for which it
is moore digne than any oother preyere ; for that Jhesu Crist hymself
maked it ; CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1618

and it is short , for it sholde be koud the moore lightly , and for to
withholden it the moore esily in herte , and helpen hymself the ofter
with the orisoun , and for a man sholde be the lasse wery to seyen it ,
and for a man may nat excusen hym to lerne it , it is so short and so
esy ; and for it comprehendeth in it self alle goode preyeres .
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1619

The exposicioun of this hooly preyere , that is so excellent and digne ,
I bitake to thise maistres of theologie , save thus muchel wol I seyn ;
that whan thow prayest that God sholde for_yeve thee thy giltes as thou
foryevest hem that agilten to thee , be ful wel war that thow ne be nat
out of charitee . CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1620

This hooly orison amenuseth eek venyal synne , CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1621

and therfore it aperteneth specially to penitence .
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1622

This preyere moste be trewely seyd , and in verray feith ,
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1623

and that men preye to God ordinatly and discreetly and devoutly ;
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1624

and alwey a man shal putten his wyl to be subget to the wille of God .
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1625

This orisoun moste eek Been seyd with greet humblesse and ful pure ;
honestly , and nat to the anoyaunce of any man or womman .
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1626

It moste eek been continued with the werkes of charitee .
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1627

It avayleth eek agayn the vices of the soule , CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1628

for , as seith Seint Jerome , " By fastynge been saved the vices of the
flessh , and by preyere the vices of the soule . "
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1629

<P_326.C2>

After this , thou shalt understonde that bodily peyne stant in wakynge ,
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1631

for Jhesu Crist seith , " Waketh and preyeth , that ye ne entre in
wikked temptacioun . " CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1632

Ye shul understanden also that fastynge stant in thre thynges : in
forberynge of bodily mete and drynke , and in forberynge of worldly
jolitee , and in forberynge of deedly synne ; this is to seyn , that a
man shal kepen hym fro deedly synne with al his might .
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1633

And thou shalt understanden eek that God ordeyned fastynge ,
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1634

and to fastynge appertenen foure thinges : largenesse to povre folk ;
gladnesse of herte espiritueel , nat to been angry ne anoyed , ne
grucche for he fasteth ; and also resonable houre for to ete ; ete by
mesure ; that is for to seyn , a man shal nat ete in untyme , ne sitte
the lenger at his table to ete for he fasteth . CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1635

Thanne shal@ @tow understonde that bodily peyne stant in disciplyne or
techynge , by word , or by writynge , or in ensample ; also in werynge
of heyres , or of stamyn , or of haubergeons on hire naked flessh , for
Cristes sake , and swiche manere penances . CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1636

But war thee wel that swiche manere penaunces on thy flessh ne make nat
thyn herte bitter or angry or anoyed of thyself ;
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1637

for bettre is to caste awey Thyn heytre , than for to caste awey the
swetenesse of Jhesu Crist . CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1638

And therfore seith Seint Paul , " Clothe yow , as they that been chosen
of God , in herte of misericorde , debonairetee , suffraunce , and swich
manere of clothynge , " of whiche Jhesu Crist is moore apayed than of
heyres , or haubergeouns , or hauberkes . CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1639

Thanne is discipline eek in knokkynge of thy brest , in scourgynge with
yerdes , in knelynges , in tribulaciouns , in suffrynge paciently
wronges that been doon to thee , and eek in pacient suffraunce of
maladies , or lesynge of worldly catel , or of wyf , or of child , or
othere freendes . CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1640

Thanne shal@ @tow understonde whiche thynges destourben penaunce ;
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1641

and this is in foure maneres , that is , drede , shame , hope , and
wanhope , that is , desperacion . CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1642

And for to speke first of drede ; for which he weneth that he may suffre
no penaunce ; ther-agayns is remedie for to thynke that bodily penaunce
is but short and litel at regard of the peyne of helle , <P_327.C1> that
is so crueel and so long that it lasteth withouten ende .
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1643

Now again the shame that a man hath to shryven hym , and namely thise
ypocrites that wolden been holden so parfite that they han no nede to
shryven hem ; agayns that shame sholde a man thynke that , by wey of
resoun , that he that hath nat been shamed To doon foule thinges ,
certes hym oghte nat been ashamed to do faire thynges ,
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1644

and that is confessiouns . CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1645

A man sholde eek thynke that God seeth and woot alle his thoghtes and
alle his werkes , CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1646

to hym may no thyng been hyd ne covered . CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1647

men sholden eek remembren hem of the shame that is to come at the day of
doom to hem that been nat penitent and shryven in this present lyf .
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1648

For alle the creatures in hevene , in erthe , and in helle shullen seen
apertly al that they hyden in this world . CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1649

Now for to speken of the hope of hem that been necligent and slowe to
shryven hem , that stant in two maneres . CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1650

That Oon is that he hopeth for to lyve longe And for to purchacen muche
richesse for his delit , CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1651

and thanne he wol shryven hym ; CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1652

and as he seith , hym semeth thanne tymely ynough to come to shrifte .
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1653

Another is of surquidrie that he hath in Cristes mercy .
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1654

Agayns the firste vice , he shal thynke that oure life is in no
sikernesse , and eek that alle the richesses in this world ben in
aventure , and passen as a shadwe on the wal ; CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1655

and , as seith Seint Gregorie , that it aperteneth to the grete
righwisnesse of God that nevere shal the peyne stynte of hem that nevere
wolde withdrawen hem fro synne , hir thankes , but ay continue in synne
; CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1656

for thilke perpetueel wil to do synne shul they han perpetueel peyne .
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1657

Wanhope is in two maneres : CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1658

the firste wanhope is in the mercy of Crist ; CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1659

that oother is that they thynken that they ne myghte <P_327.C2> that
longe persevere in goodnesse . CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1660

The firste wanhope comth of that he demeth that he hath synned so
greetly and so ofte , and so longe leyn in synne , that he shal nat be
saved . CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1661

Certes , agayns that cursed wanhope sholde he thynke that the passion of
Jhesu Crist is moore strong for to bynde than synne is strong for to
bynde . CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1662

Agayns the seconde wanhope he shal thynke that as ofte as he falleth he
may arise agayn by penitence . CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1663

And though he never so longe have leyn in synne , the mercy of Crist is
alwey redy to receiven hym to mercy . CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1664

Agayns the wanhope that he demeth that he sholde nat longe persevere in
goodnesse , he shal thynke that the feblesse of the devel may nothyng
doon , but if men wol suffren hym ; CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1665

and eek he shal han strengthe of the help of God , and of al hooly
chirche , and of the proteccioun of aungels , if hym list .
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1666

Thanne shal men understonde what is the fruyt of penaunce ;
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1667

and , after the word of Jhesu Crist , it is the endelees blisse of
hevene , ther joye hath no contrarioustee of wo ne grevaunce ; ther alle
harmes been passed of this present lyf ; ther as is the sikernesse fro
the peyne of helle ; ther as is the blisful compaignye that rejoysen hem
everemo , everich of Otheres joye ; ther as the body of man , that
whilom was foul and derk , is moore cleer than the sonne ; ther as the
body , that whilom was syk , freele , and fieble , and mortal , is
inmortal , And so strong and so hool that ther may no thyng apeyren it ;
ther as ne is neither hunger , thurst , ne coold , but every soule
replenyssed with the sighte of the parfit knowynge of God .
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1668

This blisful regne may men purchace by poverte espiritueel , and the
glorie by lowenesse , the plentee of joye by hunger and thurst , and the
reste by travaille , and the lyf by deeth and mortificacion of synne .
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1669
