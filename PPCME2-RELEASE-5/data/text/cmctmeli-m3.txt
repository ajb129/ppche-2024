Heere bigynneth Chaucers Tale of Melibee . CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.4

<$$heading>

A yong man called Melibeus , myghty and riche , bigat upon his wyf ,
that called was Prudence , a doghter which that called was Sophie .
CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.6

Upon a day bifel that he for his desport is went into the feeldes hem to
pleye . CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.7

His wyf and eek his doghter hath he left inwith his hous , of which the
dores weren faste yshette . CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.8

Thre of his olde foes han it espyed , and setten laddres to the walles
of his hous , and by wyndowes been entred , and betten his wyf , and
wounded his doghter with fyve mortal woundes in fyve sondry places -
this is to seyn , in hir feet , in hire handes , in hir erys , in hir
nose , and in hire mouth - and leften hire for deed , and wenten awey .
CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.9

Whan Melibeus retourned was in to his hous , and saugh al this meschief
, he , lyk a mad man , rentynge his clothes , gan to wepe and crie .
CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.10

Prudence , his wyf , as ferforth as she dorste , bisoghte hym of his
wepyng for to stynte , CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.11

but nat_forthy he gan to crie and wepen evere lenger the moore .
CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.12

This noble wyf Prudence remembred hire upon the sentence of Ovide , in
his book that cleped is the Remedie of Love , where as he seith , " He
is a fool that destourbeth the mooder to wepen in the deeth of hire
child , til she have wept hir fille as for a certein tyme ,
CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.13

and thanne shal man doon his diligence with amyable wordes hire to
reconforte , and preyen hire of hir wepyng for to stynte . For which
resoun this noble wyf Prudence suffred hir housbonde for to wepe and
crie as for a certein space , CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.14

and whan she saugh hir tyme , she seyde hym in this wise :
CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.15

" Allas , my lord , " quod she , " why make ye youreself for to be lyk a
fool ? CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.16

For sothe it aperteneth nat to a wys man to maken swich a sorwe .
CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.17

Youre doghter , with the grace of God , shal warisshe and escape .
CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.18

And , al were it so that she right now were deed , ye ne oughte nat , as
for hir deeth , youreself to destroye . CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.19

Senek seith : ' the wise man shal nat take to greet disconfort for the
deeth of his children , CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.20

but , certes , he sholde suffren it in pacience as wel as he abideth the
deeth of his owene propre persone . ' " CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.21

This Melibeus answerde anon CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.22

and seyde , " What man , " quod he , " sholde of his wepyng stente that
hath so greet a cause for to wepe ? CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.23

Jhesu Crist , oure Lord , hymself wepte for the deeth of Lazarus hys
freend . " CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.24

Prudence answerde : " Certes , wel I woot attempree wepyng is no thyng
deffended to hym that sorweful is , amonges folk in sorwe , but it is
rather graunted hym to wepe . CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.25

The Apostle Paul unto the Romayns writeth , ' man shal rejoyse with hem
that maken joye , and wepen with swich folk as wepen . '
CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.26

But though attempree wepyng be ygraunted , outrageous wepyng certes is
deffended . CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.27

Mesure of wepyng sholde be considered , after the loore that techeth us
Senek : CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.28

' Whan that thy frend is deed , ' quod he , ' lat nat thyne eyen to
moyste been of teeris , ne to muche drye ; CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.29

although the teeris come to thyne eyen , lat hem nat falle ;
CMCTMELI-M3,217.C1b.30

and whan thou hast forgoon thy freend , do diligence to gete <P_218.C1>
another freend ; CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.31

and this is moore wysdom than for to wepe for thy freend which that thou
has lorn , CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.32

for therinne is no boote . ' CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.33

And therfore , if ye governe yow by sapience , put awey sorwe out of
youre herte . CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.34

Remembre yow that Jhesus Syrak seith , ' A man that is joyous and glad
in herte , it hym conserveth florissynge in his age ;
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.35

but soothly sorweful herte maketh his bones drye . '
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.36

he seith eek thus , that sorwe in herte sleeth ful many a man .
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.37

Salomon seith that right as motthes in shepes flees anoyeth to the
clothes , and the smale wormes to the tree , right so anoyeth sorwe to
the herte . Wherfore us oghte , as wel in the deeth of oure children as
in the los of oure othere goodes temporels , have pacience .
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.38

Remembre yow upon the pacient job . CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.39

Whan he hadde lost his children and his temporeel substance , and in his
body endured and receyved ful many a grevous tribulacion , yet seyde he
thus : ' oure Lord hath yeve it me ; CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.40

oure Lord hath biraft it me ; CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.41

right as oure Lord hath wold , right so it is doon ;
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.42

blessed be the name of oure Lord ! ' " CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.43

To thise forseide thynges answerde Melibeus unto his wyf Prudence :
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.44

" Alle thy wordes , " quod he , " been sothe , and therto profitable ,
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.45

but trewely myn herte is troubled with this sorwe so grevously that i n@
@oot what to doone . " CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.46

" Lat calle , " quod Prudence , " thy trewe freendes alle , and thy
lynage whiche that been wise . CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.47

Telleth youre cas , CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.48

and herkneth what they seye in conseillyng , CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.49

and yow governe after hire sentence . CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.50

Salomon seith , ' Werk alle thy thynges by conseil ,
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.51

and thou shalt never repente . ' " CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.52

Thanne , by the conseil of his wyf Prudence , this Melibeus leet callen
a greet congregacion of folk , as surgiens , phisiciens , olde folk and
yonge , and somme of his olde enemys reconsiled as by hir semblaunt to
his love and into his grace ; CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.53

and therwithal ther coomen somme of his neighebores that diden hym
reverence moore for drede than for love , as it happeth ofte .
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.54

Ther coomen also ful many subtille flatereres , and wise advocatz lerned
in the lawe . CMCTMELI-M3,218.C1.55

And whan this folk togidre assembled weren , this Melibeus in sorweful
wise shewed hem his <P_218.C2> cas . CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.56

And by the manere of his speche it semed that in herte he baar a crueel
ire , redy to doon vengeaunce upon his foes , and sodeynly desired that
the werre sholde bigynne ; CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.57

but nathelees , yet axed he hire conseil upon this matiere .
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.58

A surgien , by licence and assent of swiche as weren wise , up roos
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.59

and to Melibeus seyde as ye may heere : CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.60

" Sire , " quod he , " as to us surgiens aperteneth that we do to every
wight the beste that we kan , where as we been withholde , and to oure
pacientz that we do no damage ; wherfore it happeth many tyme and ofte
that whan twey men han everich wounded oother , oon same surgien heeleth
hem bothe ; wherfore unto oure art it is nat pertinent to norice werre
ne parties to supporte . CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.61

But certes , as to the warisshynge of youre doghter , al be it so that
she perilously be wounded , we shullen do so ententif bisynesse fro day
to nyght that with the grace of God she shal be hool and sound as soone
as is possible . " CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.62

Almoost right in the same wise the phisiciens answerden , save that they
seyden a fewe woordes moore : that right as maladies been cured by hir
contraries , right so shul men warisshe werre by vengeaunce .
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.63

His neighebores ful of envye , his feyned freendes that semeden
reconsiled , and his flatereres maden semblant of wepyng ,
CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.64

and empeireden and agreggeden muchel of this matiere in preisynge
greetly Melibee of myght , of power , of richesse , and of freendes ,
despisynge the power of his adversaries , CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.65

and seiden outrely that he anon sholde wreken hym on his foes , and
bigynne werre . CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.66

Up roos thanne an advocat that was wys , by leve and by conseil of
othere that were wise , CMCTMELI-M3,218.C2.67

and seide : " Lordynges , the nede for which we been assembled in this
place is a ful hevy thyng and an heigh matiere , by cause of the wrong
and of the wikkednesse that hath be doon , and eek by resoun of the
grete damages that in tyme comynge been possible to fallen for this same
cause , and eek by resoun of the grete richesse and power of the parties
bothe , for the whiche resouns it were a <P_219.C1> ful greet peril to
erren in this matiere . Wherfore , Melibeus , this is oure sentence :
CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.68

we conseille yow aboven alle thyng that right anon thou do thy diligence
in kepynge of thy propre persone in swich a wise that thou ne wante noon
espie ne wacche , thy persone for to save . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.69

and after that , we conseille that in thyn hous thou sette sufficeant
garnisoun so that they may as wel thy body as thyn hous defende .
CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.70

But certes , for to moeve werre , ne sodeynly for to doon vengeaunce ,
we may nat demen in so litel tyme that it were profitable . Wherfore we
axen leyser and espace to have deliberacion in this cas to deme .
CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.71

For the commune proverbe seith thus : ' He that soone deemeth , soone
shal repente . ' CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.72

And eek men seyn that thilke juge is wys that soone understondeth a
matiere and juggeth by leyser ; CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.73

for al be it so that alle tariyng be anoyful , algates it is nat to
repreve in yevynge of juggement ne in vengeance takyng , whan it is
sufficeant and resonable . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.74

And that shewed oure Lord Jhesu Crist by ensample ,
CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.75

for whan that the womman that was taken in avowtrie was broght in his
presence to knowen what sholde be doon with hire persone , al be it so
that he wiste wel hymself what that he wolde answere , yet ne wolde he
nat answere sodeynly , CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.76

but he wolde have deliberacion , CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.77

and in the ground he wroot twies . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.78

And by thise causes we axen deliberacioun , CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.79

and we shal thanne , by the grace of God , conseille thee thyng that
shal be profitable . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.80

Up stirten thanne the yonge folk atones , CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.81

and the mooste partie of that compaignye han scorned this olde wise man
, and bigonnen to make noyse , CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.82

and seyden that right so as , whil that iren is hoot , men sholden smyte
, right so men sholde wreken hir wronges whil that they been fresshe and
newe ; CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.83

and with loud voys they criden " Werre ! werre ! "
CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.84

Up roos tho oon of thise olde wise , CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.85

and with his hand made contenaunce that men sholde holden hem stille and
yeven hym audience . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C1.86

" Lordynges , " quod he , " ther is ful many a man <P_219.C2> that
crieth ' Werre ! werre ! ' that woot ful litel what werre amounteth .
CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.87

Werre at his bigynnyng hath so greet an entryng and so large that every
wight may entre whan hym liketh and lightly fynde werre ;
CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.88

but certes what ende that shal therof bifalle , it is nat light to knowe
. CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.89

For soothly , whan that werre is ones bigonne , ther is ful many a child
unborn of his mooder that shal sterve yong by cause of thilke werre , or
elles lyve in sorwe and dye in wrecchednesse . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.90

And therfore , er that any werre bigynne , men moste have greet conseil
and greet deliberacion . " CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.91

And whan this olde man wende to enforcen his tale by resons , wel ny
alle atones bigonne they to rise for to breken his tale , and beden hym
ful ofte his wordes for to abregge . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.92

For soothly , he that precheth to hem that listen nat heeren his wordes
, his sermon hem anoieth . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.93

For Jhesus Syrak seith that " musik in wepynge is a noyous thyng " ;
CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.94

this is to seyn : as muche availleth to speken bifore folk to which his
speche anoyeth as it is to synge biforn hym that wepeth .
CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.95

And whan this wise man saugh that hym wanted audience , al shamefast he
sette hym doun agayn . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.96

For Salomon seith : " Ther as thou ne mayst have noon audience , enforce
thee nat to speke . " CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.97

" I see wel , " quod this wise man , " that the commune proverbe is
sooth , that ' good conseil wanteth whan it is moost nede . ' "
CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.98

Yet hadde this Melibeus in his conseil many folk that prively in his
eere conseilled hym certeyn thyng , and conseilled hym the contrarie in
general audience . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.99

Whan Melibeus hadde herd that the gretteste partie of his conseil weren
accorded that he sholde maken werre , anoon he consented to hir
conseillyng CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.100

and fully affermed hire sentence . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.101

Thanne dame Prudence , whan that she saugh how that hir housbonde shoop
hym for to wreken hym on his foes and to bigynne werre , she in ful
humble wise , whan she saugh hir tyme , seide to hym thise wordes :
CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.102

" My lord , " quod she , " I yow biseche as hertely as I dar and kan ,
ne haste yow nat to faste CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.103

and , for alle gerdons , as yeveth me audience . CMCTMELI-M3,219.C2.104

For Piers Alfonce seith , <P_220.C1> ' Whoso that dooth to thee oother
good or harm , haste thee nat to quiten it , CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.105

for in this wise thy freend wole abyde CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.106

and thyn enemy shal the lenger lyve in drede . ' CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.107

The proverbe seith , ' He hasteth wel that wisely kan abyde , '
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.108

and ' in wikked haste is no profit . " CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.109

This Melibee answerde unto his wyf Prudence : " I purpose nat , " quod
he , " to werke by thy conseil , for many causes and resouns .
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.110

For certes , every wight wolde holde me thanne a fool ; this is to seyn
, if I , for thy conseillyng , wolde chaungen thynges that been ordeyned
and affermed by so manye wyse . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.111

Secoundely , I seye that alle wommen been wikke , and noon good of hem
alle . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.112

For ' of a_thousand men , ' seith Salomon , ' I foond o good man ,
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.113

but certes , of alle wommen , good womman foond I nevere . '
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.114

And also , certes , if I governed me by thy conseil , it sholde seme
that I hadde yeve to thee over me the maistrie , CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.115

and God forbede that it so weere ! CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.116

For Jhesus Syrak seith that ' if the wyf have maistrie , she is
contrarious to hir housbonde . ' CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.117

And Salomon seith : ' Nevere in thy lyf to thy wyf , ne to thy child ,
ne to thy freend , ne yeve no power over thyself ,
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.118

for bettre it were that thy children aske of thy persone thynges that
hem nedeth than {it_were} thou see thyself in the handes of thy children
. ' CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.119

And also if I wolde werke by thy conseillyng , certes , my conseil moste
som tyme be secree , til it were tyme that it moste be knowe ,
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.120

and this ne may noght be . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.121

Car il est escript , la genglerie des femmes ne puet riens celler fors
ce qu'elle ne scet . Apres , le philosophre dit , en mauvais conseil
les femmes vainquent les hommes ; et par ces raisons je ne dois point
user de ton conseil . " CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.122

Whanne dame Prudence , ful debonairly and with greet pacience , hadde
herd al that hir housbonde liked for to seye , thanne axed she of hym
licence for to speke , CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.123

and seyde in this wise : CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.124

" My lord , " quod she , " as to youre firste resoun , certes it may
lightly been answered . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C1.125

For I seye that it is no folie to chaunge conseil whan the thyng is
chaunged , or elles whan the thyng semeth ootherweyes than it <P_220.C2>
was biforn . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.126

And mooreover , I seye that though ye han sworn and bihight to perfourne
youre emprise , and nathelees ye weyve to perfourne thilke same emprise
by juste cause , men sholde nat seyn therfore that ye were a liere ne
forsworn . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.127

For the book seith that ' the wise man maketh no lesyng whan he turneth
his corage to the bettre . ' CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.128

And al be it so that youre emprise be establissed and ordeyned by greet
multitude of folk , yet thar ye nat accomplice thilke ordinaunce but yow
like . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.129

For the trouthe of thynges and the profit been rather founden in fewe
folk that been wise and ful of resoun than by greet multitude of folk
ther every man crieth and clatereth what that hym liketh .
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.130

Soothly swich multitude is nat honest . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.131

And as to the seconde resoun , where as ye seyn that alle wommen been
wikke ; save youre grace , certes ye despisen alle wommen in this wyse ,
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.132

and ' he that al despiseth , al displeseth , ' as seith the book .
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.133

And Senec seith that ' whoso wole have sapience shal no man dispreyse ,
but he shal gladly techen the science that he kan withouten presumpcion
or pride ; CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.134

and swiche thynges as he noght ne kan , he shal nat been ashamed to
lerne hem , and enquere of lasse folk than hymself . '
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.135

And , sire , that ther hath been many a good womman , may lightly be
preved . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.136

For certes , sire , oure Lord Jhesu Crist wolde nevere have descended to
be born of a womman , if alle wommen hadden been wikke .
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.137

And after that , for the grete bountee that is in wommen , oure Lord
Jhesu Crist , whan he was risen fro deeth to lyve , appeered rather to a
womman than to his Apostles . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.138

And though that Salomon seith that he ne foond nevere womman good , it
folweth nat therfore that alle wommen ben wikke .
CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.139

For though that he ne foond no good womman , certes , many another man
hath founden many a womman ful good and trewe . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.140

Or elles , per_aventure , the entente of Salomon was this : that , as in
sovereyn bounte , he foond no womman - this is to seyn , that ther is no
wight that hath sovereyn bountee save God allone , as he hymself
recordeth in hys Evaungelie . CMCTMELI-M3,220.C2.141

For ther n@ @ys no creature so good <P_221.C1> that hym ne wanteth
somwhat of the perfeccioun of God , that is his makere .
CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.142

Youre thridde reson is this : CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.143

ye seyn that if ye governe yow by my conseil , it sholde seme that ye
hadde yeve me the maistrie and the lordshipe over youre persone .
CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.144

Sire , save youre grace , it is nat so . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.145

For if it so were that no man sholde be conseilled but oonly of hem that
hadden lordshipe and maistrie of his persone , men wolden nat be
conseilled so ofte . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.146

For soothly thilke man that asketh conseil of a purpos , yet hath he
free choys wheither he wole werke by that conseil or noon .
CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.147

And as to youre fourthe resoun , ther ye seyn that the janglerie of
wommen kan hyde thynges that they wot noght , as who seith that a womman
kan nat hyde that she woot ; sire , thise wordes been understonde of
wommen that been jangleresses and wikked ; of whiche wommen men seyn
that thre thynges dryven a man out of his hous - that is to seyn , smoke
, droppyng of reyn , and wikked wyves ; CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.148

and of swiche wommen seith Salomon that ' it were bettre dwelle in
desert than with a womman that is riotous . ' CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.149

And sire , by youre leve , that am nat I ; CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.150

for ye han ful ofte assayed my grete silence and my grete pacience , and
eek how wel that I kan hyde and hele thynges that men oghte secreely to
hyde . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.151

And soothly , as to youre fifthe resoun , where as ye seyn that in
wikked conseil wommen venquisshe men , God woot , thilke resoun stant
heere in no stede . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.152

For understoond now , CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.153

ye asken conseil to do wikkednesse ; CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.154

and if ye wole werken wikkednesse , and youre wif restreyneth thilke
wikked purpos , and overcometh yow by reson and by good conseil , certes

CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.155

Thus sholde ye understonde the philosophre that seith , ' In wikked
conseil wommen venquisshen hir housbondes . ' CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.156

And ther as ye blamen alle wommen and hir resouns , I shal shewe yow by
manye ensamples that many a womman hath ben ful good , and yet been ,
and hir conseils ful hoolsome and profitable . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.157

Eek som men han seyd that the conseillynge of wommen is outher to deere
or elles to litel of pris . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C1.158

But al <P_221.C2> be it so that ful many a womman is badde and hir
conseil vile and noght worth , yet han men founde ful many a good womman
, and ful discret and wis in conseillynge . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.159

Loo , Jacob by good conseil of his mooder Rebekka , wan the benysoun of
Ysaak his fader and the lordshipe over alle his bretheren .
CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.160

Judith by hire good conseil delivered the citee of Bethulie , in which
she dwelled , out of the handes of Olofernus , that hadde it biseged and
wolde have al destroyed it . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.161

Abygail delivered Nabal hir housbonde fro David the kyng , that wolde
have slayn hym , CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.162

and apaysed the ire of the kyng by hir wit and by hir good conseillyng .
CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.163

Hester , by hir good conseil enhaunced greetly the peple of God in the
regne of Assuerus the kyng . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.164

And the same bountee in good conseillyng of many a good womman may men
telle . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.165

And mooreover , whan oure Lord hadde creat Adam , oure forme fader , he
seyde in this wise : CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.166

' It is nat good to been a man alloone ; CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.167

make we to hym an helpe semblable to hymself . ' CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.168

Heere may ye se that if that wommen were nat goode , and hir conseils
goode and profitable , oure Lord God of hevene wolde nevere han wroght
hem , ne called hem help of man , but rather confusioun of man .
CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.169

And ther seyde oones a clerk in two vers , ' What is bettre than gold ?
CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.170

Jaspre . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.171

What is bettre than Jaspre ? CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.172

Wisedoom . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.173

And what is better than wisedoom ? CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.174

Womman . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.175

And what is bettre than a good womman ? CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.176

Nothyng . ' CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.177

And , sire , by manye of othre resons may ye seen that manye wommen been
goode , and hir conseils goode and profitable . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.178

And therfore , sire , if ye wol triste to my conseil , I shal restoore
yow youre doghter hool and sound . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.179

And eek I wol do to yow so muche that ye shul have honour in this cause
. " CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.180

Whan Melibee hadde herd the wordes of his wyf Prudence , he seyde thus :
CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.181

" I se wel that the word of Salomon is sooth . CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.182

He seith that ' Wordes that been spoken discreetly by ordinaunce been
honycombes , CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.183

for they yeven swetnesse to the soule and hoolsomnesse to the body . '
CMCTMELI-M3,221.C2.184

And , wyf , by cause of thy sweete wordes , and eek for I have assayed
and preved <P_222.C1> thy grete sapience and thy grete trouthe , I wol
governe me by thy conseil in alle thyng . " CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.185

" Now , sire , " quod dame prudence , " and syn ye vouche_sauf to been
governed by my conseil , I wol enforme yow how ye shul governe yourself
in chesynge of youre conseillours . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.186

Ye shul first in alle youre werkes mekely biseken to the heighe God that
he wol be youre conseillour ; CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.187

and shapeth yow to swich entente that he yeve yow conseil and confort ,
as taughte thobie his sone : CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.188

' At alle tymes thou shalt blesse God , and praye hym to dresse thy
weyes , and looke that alle thy conseils been in hym for everemoore . '
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.189

Seint Jame eek seith : ' If any of yow have nede of sapience , axe it of
God . ' CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.190

And afterward thanne shul ye taken conseil in youreself , and examyne
wel youre thoghtes of swich thyng as yow thynketh that is best for youre
profit . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.191

And thanne shul ye dryve fro youre herte thre thynges that been
contrariouse to good conseil ; that is to seyn , ire , coveitise , and
hastifnesse . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.192

" First , he that axeth conseil of hymself , certes he moste been
withouten ire , for manye causes . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.193

The firste is this : CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.194

he that hath greet ire and wratthe in hymself , he weneth alwey that he
may do thyng that he may nat do . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.195

And secoundely , he that is irous and wrooth , he ne may nat wel deme ;
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.196

and he that may nat wel deme , may nat wel conseille .
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.197

The thridde is this , that he that is irous and wrooth , as seith senec
, ne may nat speke but blameful thynges , CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.198

and with his viciouse wordes he stireth oother folk to angre and to ire
. CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.199

And eek , sire , ye moste dryve coveitise out of youre herte .
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.200

For the apostle seith that coveitise is roote of alle harmes .
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.201

And trust wel that a coveitous man ne kan noght deme ne thynke , but
oonly to fulfille the ende of his coveitise ; CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.202

and certes , that ne may nevere been accompliced ;
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.203

for evere the moore habundaunce that he hath of richesse , the moore he
desireth . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.204

And , sire , ye moste also dryve out of youre herte hastifnesse ;
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.205

for certes , ye ne may nat deeme for the beste by a sodeyn thought that
falleth in youre herte , CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.206

but ye moste avyse yow on it ful ofte . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C1.207

For , as ye herde her biforn , the <P_222.C2> commune proverbe is this ,
that ' he that soone deemeth , soone repenteth . '
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.208

Sire , ye ne be nat alwey in lyk disposicioun ; CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.209

for certes , somthyng that somtyme semeth to yow that it is good for to
do , another tyme it semeth to yow the contrarie .
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.210

Whan ye han taken conseil in youreself , and han deemed by good
deliberacion swich thyng as yow semeth best , thanne rede I yow that ye
kepe it secree . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.211

Biwrey nat youre conseil to no persone , but if so be that ye wenen
sikerly that thurgh youre biwreyyng youre condicioun shal be to yow the
moore profitable . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.212

For Jhesus Syrak seith , ' Neither to thy foo , ne to thy frend ,
discovere nat thy secree ne thy folie , CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.213

for they wol yeve yow audience and lookynge and supportacioun in thy
presence , and scorne thee in thyn absence . ' CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.214

Another clerk seith that ' scarsly shal@ @tou fynden any persone that
may kepe conseil secrely . ' CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.215

the book seith , ' Whil that thou kepest thy conseil in thyn herte ,
thou kepest it in thy prisoun , CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.216

and whan thou biwreyest thy conseil to any wight , he holdeth thee in
his snare . ' CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.217

and therfore yow is bettre to hyde youre conseil in youre herte than
praye him to whom ye han biwreyed youre conseil that he wole kepen it
cloos and stille . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.218

For Seneca seith : ' If so be that thou ne mayst nat thyn owene conseil
hyde , how dars@ @tou prayen any oother wight thy conseil secrely to
kepe ? ' CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.219

But nathelees , if thou wene sikerly that the biwreiyng of thy conseil
to a persone wol make thy condicion to stonden in the bettre plyt ,
thanne shal@ @tou tellen hym thy conseil in this wise .
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.220

First thou shalt make no semblant wheither thee were levere pees or
werre , or this or that , ne shewe hym nat thy wille and thyn entente .
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.221

For trust wel that comunli thise conseillours been flatereres , namely
the conseillours of grete lordes , CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.222

for they enforcen hem alwey rather to speken plesante wordes ,
enclynynge to the lordes lust , than wordes that been trewe or
profitable . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.223

And therfore men seyn that the riche man hath seeld good conseil , but
if he have it of hymself . CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.224

And after that thou shalt considere thy freendes and thyne enemys .
CMCTMELI-M3,222.C2.225

And as touchynge thy freendes , thou shalt considere which of hem been
moost feithful and moost wise <P_223.C1> and eldest and most approved in
conseillyng ; CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.226

and of hem shalt thou aske thy conseil , as the caas requireth .
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.227

I seye that first ye shul clepe to youre conseil youre freendes that
been trewe . CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.228

For Salomon seith that ' right as the herte of a man deliteth in savour
that is soote , right so the conseil of trewe freendes yeveth swetnesse
to the soule . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.229

He seith also , ' Ther may no thyng be likned to the trewe freend ,
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.230

for certes gold ne silver ben nat so muche worth as the goode wyl of a
trewe freend . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.231

And eek he seith that ' a trewe freend is a strong deffense ;
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.232

who so that it fyndeth , certes he fyndeth a greet tresour . '
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.233

Thanne shul ye eek considere if that youre trewe freendes been discrete
and wise . CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.234

For the book seith , ' Axe alwey thy conseil of hem that been wise . '
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.235

And by this same resoun shul ye clepen to youre conseil of youre
freendes that been of age , swiche as han seyn and been expert in manye
thynges and been approved in conseillynges . CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.236

for the book seith that ' in olde men is the sapience , and in longe
tyme the prudence . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.237

And Tullius seith that ' grete thynges ne been nat ay accompliced by
strengthe , ne by delivernesse of body , but by good conseil , by
auctoritee of persones , and by science ; the whiche thre thynges ne
been nat fieble by age , CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.238

but certes they enforcen and encreescen day by day . '
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.239

And thanne shul ye kepe this for a general reule :
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.240

First shul ye clepen to youre conseil a fewe of youre freendes that been
especiale ; CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.241

for Salomon seith , ' Manye freendes have thou , CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.242

but among a_thousand chese thee oon to be thy conseillour . '
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.243

For al be it so that thou first ne telle thy conseil but to a fewe ,
thou mayst afterward telle it to mo folk if it be nede .
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.244

But looke alwey that thy conseillours have thilke thre condiciouns that
i have seyd bifore - that is to seyn , that they be trewe , wise , and
of oold experience . CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.245

And werke nat alwey in every nede by oon counseillour allone ;
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.246

for somtyme bihooveth it to been conseilled by manye .
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.247

For Salomon seith , ' Salvacion of thynges is where as ther been manye
conseillours . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.248

" Now , sith that i have toold yow of which folk ye sholde been
conseilled , now wol I teche yow which conseil ye oghte to eschewe .
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.249

First , ye shul eschue the conseillyng of fooles ;
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C1.250

<P_223.C2>

for Salomon seith , ' Taak no conseil of a fool , CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.252

for he ne kan noght conseille but after his owene lust and his
affeccioun . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.253

the book seith that ' the propretee of a fool is this :
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.254

he troweth lightly harm of every wight , CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.255

and lightly troweth alle bountee in hymself . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.256

thou shalt eek eschue the conseillyng of alle flatereres , swiche as
enforcen hem rather to preise youre persone by flaterye than for to
telle yow the soothfastnesse of thynges . Wherfore tullius seith , '
Amonges alle the pestilences that been in freendshipe the gretteste is
flaterie . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.257

and therfore is it moore nede that thou eschue and drede flatereres than
any oother peple . CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.258

The book seith , ' Thou shalt rather drede and flee fro the sweete
wordes of flaterynge preiseres than fro the egre wordes of thy freend
that seith thee thy sothes . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.259

Salomon seith that ' the wordes of a flaterere is a snare to cacche with
innocentz . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.260

He seith also that ' he that speketh to his freend wordes of swetnesse
and of plesaunce , setteth a net biforn his feet to cacche hym . '
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.261

and therfore seith tullius , ' Enclyne nat thyne eres to flatereres ,
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.262

ne taak no conseil of the wordes of flaterye . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.263

and Caton seith , ' Avyse thee wel , CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.264

and eschue the wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce . '
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.265

and eek thou shalt eschue the conseillyng of thyne olde enemys that been
reconsiled . CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.266

The book seith that ' no wight retourneth saufly into the grace of his
olde enemy . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.267

and Isope seith , ' Ne trust nat to hem to whiche thou hast had som tyme
werre or enemytee , CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.268

ne telle hem nat thy conseil . ' CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.269

And Seneca telleth the cause why : CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.270

' it may nat be , ' seith he , ' that where greet fyr hath longe tyme
endured , that ther ne dwelleth som vapour of warmness . '
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.271

and therfore seith Salomon , ' In thyn olde foo trust nevere . '
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.272

for sikerly , though thyn enemy be reconsiled , and maketh thee chiere
of hymylitee , and lowteth to thee with his heed , ne trust hym nevere .
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.273

For certes he maketh thilke feyned humilitee moore for his profit than
for any love of thy persone , by cause that he deemeth to have victorie
over thy persone by swich feyned contenance , the which victorie he
myghte nat have by strif or werre . CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.274

And Peter Alfonce seith , ' Make no felawshipe with thyne olde enemys ,
CMCTMELI-M3,223.C2.275

for if thou <P_224.C1> do hem bountee , they wol perverten it into
wikkednesse . ' CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.276

And eek thou most eschue the conseillyng of hem that been thy servantz
and beren thee greet reverence , CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.277

for peraventure they seyn it moore for drede than for love .
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.278

And therfore seith a philosophre in this wise : CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.279

' Ther is no wight parfitly trewe to hym that he to soore dredeth . '
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.280

And Tullius seith , ' Ther n@ @ys no myght so greet of any emperour that
longe may endure , but if he have moore love of the peple than drede .
' CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.281

Thou shalt also eschue the conseiling of folk that been dronkelewe ,
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.282

for they ne kan no conseil hyde . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.283

For Salomon seith , ' Ther is no privetee ther as regneth dronkenesse .
' CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.284

Ye shul also han in suspect the conseillyng of swich folk as conseille
yow o thyng prively , and conseille yow the contrarie openly .
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.285

For Cassidorie seith that ' it is a manere sleighte to hyndre , whan he
sheweth to doon o thyng openly and werketh prively the contrarie . '
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.286

thou shalt also have in suspect the conseillyng of wikked folk .
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.287

For the book seith , ' The conseillyng of wikked folk is alwey ful of
fraude . ' CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.288

And David seith , ' Blisful is that man that hath nat folwed the
conseilyng of shrewes . ' CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.289

thou shalt also eschue the conseillyng of yong folk ,
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.290

for hir conseil is nat rype . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.291

" Now , sire , sith i have shewed yow of which folk ye shul take youre
conseil , and of which folk ye shul folwe the conseil , now wol I teche
yow how ye shal examyne youre conseil , after the doctrine of Tullius .
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.292

In the examynynge thanne of youre conseillour ye shul considere manye
thynges . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.293

Alderfirst thou shalt considere that in thilke thyng that thou purposest
, and upon what thyng thou wolt have conseil , that verray trouthe be
seyd and conserved ; this is to seyn , telle trewely thy tale .
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.294

For he that seith fals may nat wel be conseilled in that cas of which he
lieth . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.295

And after this thou shalt considere the thynges that acorden to that
thou purposest for to do by thy conseillours , if resoun accorde therto
, and eek if thy myght may atteine therto , and if the moore part and
the bettre part of thy conseillours acorde therto , or noon .
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C1.296

Thanne @shal @tou considere what thyng shal folwe of that conseillyng ,
as hate <P_224.C2> , pees , werre , grace , profit , or damage , and
manye othere thynges . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.297

And in alle thise thynges thou shalt chese the beste , and weyve alle
othere thynges . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.298

Thanne @shal @tow considere of what roote is engendred the matiere of
thy conseil , and what fruyt it may conceyve and engendre .
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.299

Thou shalt eek considere alle thise causes , fro whennes they been
sprongen . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.300

And whan ye han examyned youre conseil , as i have seyd , and which
partie is the bettre and moore profitable , and han approved it by manye
wise folk and olde , thanne shal@ @tou considere if thou mayst parfourne
it and maken of it a good ende . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.301

For certes , resoun wol nat that any man sholde bigynne a thyng , but if
he myghte parfourne it as hym oghte ; CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.302

ne no wight sholde take upon hym so hevy a charge that he myghte nat
bere it . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.303

For the proverbe seith , ' He that to muche embraceth , distreyneth
litel . ' CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.304

And Catoun seith , ' assay to do swich thyng as thou hast power to doon
, lest that the charge oppresse thee so soore that thee bihoveth to
weyve thyng that thou hast bigonne . ' CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.305

And if so be that thou be in doute wheither thou mayst parfourne a thing
or noon , chese rather to suffre than bigynne . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.306

And Piers Alphonce seith , ' If thou hast myght to doon a thyng of which
thou most repente , it is bettre " nay " than " ye . " ' this is to
seyn , that thee is bettre holde thy tonge stille than for to speke .
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.307

Thanne may ye understonde by strenger resons that if thou hast power to
parfourne a werk of which thou shalt repente , thanne is it bettre that
thou suffre than {it_is} bigynne . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.308

Wel seyn they that defenden every wight to assaye a thyng of which he is
in doute wheither he may parfourne it or noon . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.309

and after , whan ye han examyned youre conseil , as i have seyd biforn ,
and knowen wel that ye may parfourne youre emprise , conferme it thanne
sadly til it be at an ende . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.310

" Now is it resoun and tyme that I shewe yow whanne and wherfore that ye
may chaunge youre conseillours withouten youre repreve .
CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.311

Soothly , a man may chaungen his purpos and his conseil if the cause
cesseth , or whan a newe caas bitydeth . CMCTMELI-M3,224.C2.312

For the lawe seith that ' upon <P_225.C1> thynges that newely bityden
bihoveth newe conseil . ' CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.313

And Senec seith , ' If thy conseil is comen to the eeris of thyn enemy ,
chaunge thy conseil . ' CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.314

Thou mayst also chaunge thy conseil if so be that thou fynde that by
errour , or by oother cause , harm or damage may bityde .
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.315

Also if thy conseil be dishonest , or ellis cometh of dishonest cause ,
chaunge thy conseil . CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.316

For the lawes seyn that ' alle bihestes that been dishoneste been of no
value ' ; CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.317

and eek if so be that it be inpossible , or may nat goodly be parfourned
or kept . CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.318

And take this for a general reule , that every conseil that is affermed
so strongly that it may nat be chaunged for no condicioun that may
bityde , I seye that thilke conseil is wikked . "
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.319

This Melibeus , whanne he hadde herd the doctrine of his wyf dame
Prudence , answerde in this wyse : CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.320

" Dame , " quod he , " as yet into this tyme ye han wel and covenably
taught me as in general , how I shal governe me in the chesynge and in
the withholdynge of my conseillours . CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.321

But now wolde I fayn that ye wolde condescende in especial , and telle
me how liketh yow , or what semeth yow , by oure conseillours that we
han chosen in oure present nede . " CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.322

" My Lord , " quod she , " I biseke yow in al humblesse that ye wol nat
wilfully replie agayn my resouns , ne distempre youre herte , thogh i
speke thyng that yow displese . CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.323

For God woot that , as in myn entente , I speke it for youre beste , for
youre honour , and for youre profite eke . CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.324

And soothly , I hope that youre benyngnytee wol taken it in pacience .
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.325

Trusteth me wel , " quod she , " that youre conseil as in this caas ne
sholde nat , as to speke properly , be called a conseillyng , but a
mocioun or a moevyng of folye , in which conseil ye han erred in many a
sondry wise . CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.326

First and forward , ye han erred in th'@ @assemblynge of youre
conseillours . CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.327

For ye sholde first have cleped a fewe folk to youre conseil ,
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.328

and after ye myghte han shewed it to mo folk , if it hadde been nede .
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C1.329

But certes , ye han sodeynly cleped to youre conseil a greet <P_225.C2>
multitude of peple , ful chargeant and ful anoyous for to heere .
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.330

Also ye han erred , for ther@ @as ye sholden oonly have cleped to youre
conseil youre trewe frendes olde and wise , Ye han ycleped straunge folk
, yonge folk , false flatereres , and enemys reconsiled , and folk that
doon yow reverence withouten love . CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.331

And eek also ye have erred , for ye han broght with yow to youre conseil
ire , coveitise , and hastifnesse , the whiche thre thinges been
contrariouse to every conseil honest and profitable ; the whiche thre
thinges ye han nat anientissed or destroyed hem , neither in youreself ,
ne in youre conseillours , as yow oghte . CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.332

Ye han erred also , for ye han shewed to youre conseillours youre talent
and youre affeccioun to make werre anon , and for to do vengeance .
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.333

They han espied by youre wordes to what thyng ye been enclyned ;
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.334

and therfore han they rather conseilled yow to youre talent than to
youre profit . CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.335

Ye han erred also , for it semeth that yow suffiseth to han been
conseilled by thise conseillours oonly , and with litel avys , where@
@as in so greet and so heigh a nede it hadde been necessarie mo
conseillours and moore deliberacion to parfourne youre emprise .
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.336

Ye han erred also , for ye ne han nat examyned youre conseil in the
forseyde manere , ne in due manere , as the caas requireth .
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.337

Ye han erred also , CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.338

for ye han maked no division bitwixe youre conseillours - this is to
seyn , bitwixen youre trewe freendes and youre feyned conseillours -
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.339

ne ye han nat knowe the wil of youre trewe freendes olde and wise ;
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.340

but ye han cast alle hire wordes in an hochepot , and enclyned youre
herte to the moore part and to the gretter nombre ,
CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.341

and there been ye condescended . CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.342

And sith ye woot wel that men shal alwey fynde a gretter nombre of
fooles than of wise men , and therfore the conseils that been at
congregaciouns and multitudes of folk , there as men take moore reward
to the nombre than to the sapience of persones , ye se wel that in
swiche conseillynges fooles han the maistrie . " CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.343

Melibeus answerde agayn , CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.344

and seyde , " I graunte wel that I have erred ; CMCTMELI-M3,225.C2.345

but there <P_226.C1> as thou hast toold me heerbiforn that he n@ @ys nat
to blame that chaungeth his conseillours in certein caas and for
certeine juste causes , I am al redy to chaunge my conseillours right as
thow wolt devyse . CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.346

the proverbe seith that ' for to do synne is mannyssh , but certes for
to persevere longe in synne is werk of the devel . ' "
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.347

To this sentence answered anon dame Prudence , CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.348

and seyde , " Examineth , " quod she , " youre conseil ,
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.349

and lat us see the whiche of hem han spoken most resonably and taught
yow best conseil . CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.350

And for as muche as that the examynacion is necessarie , lat us bigynne
at the surgiens and at the phisiciens , that first speeken in this
matiere . CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.351

I sey yow that the surgiens and phisiciens han seyd yow in youre conseil
discreetly , as hem oughte , CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.352

and in hir speche seyden ful wisely that to the office of hem aperteneth
to doon to every wight honour and profit , and no wight for to anoye ,
and after hir craft to doon greet diligence unto the cure of hem which
that they han in hir governaunce . CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.353

And , sire , right as they han answered wisely and discreetly , right so
rede I that they been heighly and sovereynly gerdoned for hir noble
speche ; and eek for they sholde do the moore ententif bisynesse in the
curacion of youre doghter deere . CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.354

For al be it so that they been youre freendes , therfore shal ye nat
suffren that they serve yow for noght , CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.355

but ye oghte the rather gerdone hem and shewe hem youre largesse .
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.356

And as touchynge the proposicioun which that the phisiciens encreesceden
in this caas - this is to seyn - that in maladies that oon contrarie is
warisshed by another contrarie , I wolde fayn knowe hou ye understonde
thilke text , and what is youre sentence . " CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.357

" Certes , " quod Melibeus , " I understonde it in this wise : that
right as they han doon me a contrarie , right so sholde I doon hem
another . CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.358

For right as they han venged hem on me and doon me wrong , right so shal
I venge me upon hem and doon hem wrong ; CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.359

and thanne have I cured oon contrarie by another . "
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C1.360

" Lo , lo , " quod dame Prudence , " how lightly is every man enclined
to his owene desir and <P_226.C2> to his owene plesaunce !
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.361

Certes , " quod she , " the wordes of the phisiciens ne sholde nat han
been understonden in thys wise . CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.362

For certes , wikkednesse is nat contrarie to wikkednesse , ne vengeance
to vengeaunce , ne wrong to wrong , CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.363

but they been semblable . CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.364

And therfore o vengeaucne is nat warisshed by another vengeaunce , ne o
wroong by another wroong , CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.365

but everich of hem encreesceth and aggreggeth oother .
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.366

But certes , the wordes of the phisiciens sholde been understonden in
this wise : CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.367

for good and wikkednesse been two contraries , and pees and werre ,
vengeaunce and suffraunce , discord and accord , and manye othere
thynges , CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.368

but certes , wikkednesse shal be warisshed by goodnesse , discord by
accord , werre by pees , and so forth of othere thynges .
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.369

And heerto accordeth Seint Paul the Apostle in manye places .
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.370

He seith , ' Ne yeldeth nat harm for harm , ne wikked speche for wikked
speche , CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.371

but do wel to hym that dooth thee harm CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.372

and blesse hym that seith to thee harm . ' CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.373

And in manye othere places he amonesteth pees and accord .
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.374

But now wol I speke to yow of the conseil which that was yeven to yow by
the men of lawe and the wise folk , that seyden alle by oon accord , as
ye han herd bifore , that over alle thynges ye shal doon youre diligence
to kepen youre persone and to warnestoore youre hous ; and seyden also
that in this caas yow {COM:note_subject_verb_agreement} oghten for to
werken ful avysely and with greet deliberacioun .
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.375

And , sire , as to the firste point , that toucheth to the kepyng of
youre persone , ye shul understonde that he that hath werre shal
everemoore mekely and devoutly preyen , biforn alle thynges , that
Jhesus Crist of his mercy wol han hym in his proteccion and been his
sovereyn helpyng at his nede . CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.376

For certes , in this world ther is no wight that may be conseilled ne
kept sufficeantly withouten the kepyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.377

To this sentence accordeth the prophete David , that seith , ' If God ne
kepe the citee , in ydel waketh he that it kepeth . '
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.378

Now , sire , thanne shul ye committe the kepyng of youre persone to
youre trewe freendes , that been approved and yknowe ,
CMCTMELI-M3,226.C2.379

<P_227.C1>

and of hem shul ye axen help youre persone for to kepe .
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.381

For Catoun seith , ' If thou hast nede of help , axe it of thy freendes
; CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.382

for ther n@ @ys noon so good a phisicien as thy trewe freend . '
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.383

And after this thanne shul ye kepe yow fro alle straunge folk , and fro
lyeres , and have alwey in suspect hire compaignye .
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.384

For Piers Alfonce seith , ' Ne taak no compaignye by the weye of a
straunge man , but if so be that thou have knowe hym of a lenger tyme .
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.385

And if so be that he falle into thy compaignye paraventure , withouten
thyn assent , enquere thanne as subtilly as thou mayst of his
conversacion , and of his lyf bifore , CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.386

and feyne thy wey ; CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.387

seye that thou $wolt thider as thou wolt nat go ; CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.388

and if he bereth a spere , hoold thee on the right syde ,
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.389

and if he bere a swerd , hoold thee on the lift syde . '
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.390

and after this thanne shul ye kepe yow wisely from all swich manere
peple as I have seyd bifore , and hem and hir conseil eschewe .
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.391

And after this thanne shul ye kepe yow in swich manere that , for any
presumpcion of youre strengthe , that ye ne dispise nat , ne accompte
nat the myght of youre adversarie so litel , that ye lete the kepyng of
youre persone for youre presumpcioun , CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.392

for every wys man dredeth his enemy . CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.393

And Salomon seith , ' Weleful is he that of alle hath drede ,
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.394

for certes , he that thurgh the hardynesse of his herte , and thurgh the
hardynesse of hymself , hath to greet presumpcioun , hym shal yvel
bityde . ' CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.395

thanne shul ye everemoore contrewayte embusshementz and alle espiaille .
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.396

For Senec seith that ' the wise man that dredeth harmes , eschueth
harmes , CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.397

ne he ne falleth into perils that perils eschueth . '
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.398

and al be it so that it seme that thou art in siker place , yet shal@
@tow alwey do thy diligence in kepynge of thy persone ; this is to seyn
, ne be nat necligent to kepe thy persone , nat oonly for thy gretteste
enemys , but fro thy leeste enemy . CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.399

Senek seith , ' A man that is well avysed , he dredeth his leste enemy .
' CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.400

Ovyde seith that ' the litel wesele wol slee the grete bole and the
wilde hert . ' CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.401

And the book seith , ' A litel thorn may prikke a kyng ful soore ,
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C1.402

and <P_227.C2> an hound wol holde the wolde boor . '
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.403

But nathelees , I sey nat thou shalt be so coward that thou doute ther
wher as is no drede . CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.404

The book seith that ' somme folk han greet lust to deceyve ,
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.405

but yet they dreden hem to be deceyved . ' CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.406

Yet shal@ @tou drede to been empoisoned , and kepe the from the
compaignye of scorneres . CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.407

For the book seith , ' With scorneres make no compaignye ,
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.408

but flee hire wordes as venym . ' CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.409

" Now , as to the seconde point , where as youre wise conseillours
conseilled yow to warnestoore youre hous with gret diligence , I wolde
fayn knowe how that ye understonde thilke wordes and what is youre
sentence . " CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.410

Melibeus answerde , CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.411

and seyde , " Certes , I understande it in this wise : That I shal
warnestoore myn hous with toures , swiche as han castelles and othere
manere edifices , and armure , and artelries ; by whiche thynges I may
my persone and myn hous so kepen and deffenden that myne enemys shul
been in drede myn hous for to approche . " CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.412

To this sentence answerde anon Prudence : CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.413

" Warnestooryng , " quod she , " of heighe toures and of grete edifices
apperteyneth somtyme to pryde . CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.414

And eek men make heighe toures , <em> and grete edifices <$$em> with
grete costages and with greet travaille , CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.415

and whan that they been accompliced , yet be they nat worth a stree ,
but if they be defended by trewe freendes that been olde and wise .
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.416

and understoond wel that the gretteste and strongeste garnysoun that a
riche man may have , as wel to kepen his persone as his goodes , is that
he be biloved with hys subgetz and with his neighebores .
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.417

For thus seith Tullius , that ' ther is a manere garnysoun that no man
may vanquysse ne disconfite , CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.418

and that is a Lord to be biloved of his citezeins and of his peple . '
CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.419

now , sire , as to the thridde point , where as youre olde and wise
conseillours seyden that yow ne oghte nat sodeynly ne hastily proceden
in this nede , but that yow oghte purveyen and apparaillen yow in this
caas with greet diligence and greet deliberacioun ; trewely , I trowe
that they seyden right wisely and right sooth . CMCTMELI-M3,227.C2.420

For Tullius seith : ' In every <P_228.C1> nede , er thou bigynne it ,
apparaille thee with greet diligence . ' CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.421

Thanne seye I that in vengeance-takyng , in were , in bataille , and in
warnestooryng , er thow bigynne , I rede that thou apparaille thee
therto , and do it with greet deliberacion . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.422

For Tullius seith that ' longe apparaillyng biforn the bataille maketh
short victorie . ' CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.423

and Cassidorus seith , ' The garnysoun is stronger , whan it is longe
tyme avysed . ' CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.424

But now lat us speken of the conseil that was accorded by youre
neighebores , swiche as doon yow reverence withouten love , youre olde
enemys reconsiled , youre flatereres , that conseilled yow certeyne
thynges prively , and openly conseilleden yow the contrarie ; the yonge
folk also , that conseilleden yow to venge yow , and make werre anon .
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.425

And certes , sire , as I have seyd biforn , ye han greetly erred to han
cleped swich manere folk to youre conseil , which conseillours been
ynogh repreved by the resouns aforeseyd . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.426

But nathelees , lat us now descende to the special .
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.427

Ye shuln first procede after the doctrine of Tullius .
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.428

Certes , the trouthe of this matiere , or of this conseil , nedeth nat
diligently enquere , CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.429

for it is wel wist whiche they been that han doon to yow this trespas
and vileynye , and how manye trespassours , and in what manere they han
to yow doon al this wrong and al this vileynye . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.430

And after this , thanne shul ye examyne the seconde condicion which that
the same Tullius addeth in this matiere . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.431

For Tullius put a thyng which that he clepeth ' consentynge ' ; this is
to seyn , who been they , and which been they and how manye , that
consenten to thy conseil in thy wilfulnesse to doon hastif vengeance .
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.432

And lat us considere also who been they , and how manye been they , and
whiche been they , that consenteden to youre adversaries .
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.433

And certes , as to the first poynt , it is wel knowen whiche folk been
they that consenteden to youre hastif wilfulnesse ,
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.434

for trewely , alle tho that conseilleden yow to maken sodeyn were ne
been nat youre freendes . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.435

Lat us now considere whiche been they that ye holde so greetly youre
freendes as to youre persone . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.436

For al be it so that ye be myghty and riche , certes ye ne been but
allone , CMCTMELI-M3,228.C1.437

for certes ye ne <P_228.C2> han no child but a doghter ,
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.438

ne ye ne han bretheren , ne cosyns germayns , ne noon oother neigh
kynrede , wherfore that youre enemys for drede wholde stinte to plede
with yow , or to destroye youre persone . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.439

Ye knowen also that youre richesses mooten been dispended in diverse
parties , CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.440

and whan that every wight hath his part , they ne wollen taken but litel
reward to venge thy deeth . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.441

But thyne enemys been thre , CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.442

and they han manie children , bretheren , cosyns , and oother ny kynrede
. CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.443

And though so were that thou haddest slayn of hem two or tree , yet
dwellen ther ynowe to wreken hir deeth and to sle thy persone .
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.444

And though so be that youre kynrede be moore siker and stedefast than
the kyn of youre adversarie , yet nathelees youre kynrede n@ @ys but a
fer kynrede ; CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.445

they been but litel syb to yow , CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.446

and the kyn of youre enemys been ny syb to hem . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.447

And certes , as in that , hir condicioun is bet than youres .
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.448

Thanne lat us considere also if the conseillung of hem that conseilleden
yow to taken sodeyn vengeaunce , wheither it accorde to resoun .
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.449

And certes , ye knowe wel ' nay . ' CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.450

For , as by right and resoun , ther may no man taken vengeance on no
wight but the juge that hath the jurisdiccioun of it , whan it is
graunted hym to take thilke vengeance hastily or attemprely , as the
lawe requireth . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.451

And yet mooreover of thilke word that Tullius clepeth ' consentynge , '
thou shalt considere if thy myght and thy power may consenten and
suffise to thy wilfulnesse and to thy conseillours .
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.452

And certes thou mayst wel seyn that ' nay . ' CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.453

For sikerly , as for to speke proprely , we may do no thyng , but oonly
swich thyng as we may doon rightfully . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.454

And certes rightfully ne mowe ye take no vengeance , as of youre propre
auctoritee . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.455

Thanne mowe ye seen that youre power ne consenteth nat , ne accordeth
nat , with youre wilfulnesse . CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.456

Lat us now examyne the thridde point , that Tullius clepeth ' consequent
. ' CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.457

Thou shal understonde that the vengeance that thou purposest for to take
is the consequent ; CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.458

and therof folweth another vengeaunce , peril , and werre , and othere
damages withoute nombre , of whiche we be nat war , as at this tyme .
CMCTMELI-M3,228.C2.459

<P_229.C1>

And as touchynge the fourthe point , that Tullius clepeth ' engendrynge
, ' thou shalt considere that this wrong which that is doon to thee is
engendred of the hate of thyne enemys , and of the vengeance-takynge
upon that wolde engendre another vengeance , and muchel sorwe and
wastynge of richesses , as I seyde . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.461

Now , sire , as to the point that Tullius clepeth ' causes , ' which
that is the laste point , thou shalt understonde that the wrong that
thou hast receyved hath certeine causes , whiche that clerkes clepen
oriens and efficiens , and causa longinqua and causa propinqua , this is
to seyn , the fer cause and the ny cause . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.462

The fer cause is almyghty God , that is cause of alle thynges .
CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.463

The neer cause is thy thre enemys . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.464

The cause accidental was hate . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.465

The cause material been the fyve woundes of thy doghter .
CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.466

The cause formal is the manere of hir werkynge that broghten laddres and
cloumben in at thy wyndowes . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.467

The cause final was for to sle thy doghter . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.468

It letted nat in as muche as in hem was . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.469

But for to speken of the fer cause , as to what ende they shul come , or
what shal finally bityde of hem in this caas , ne kan I nat deeme but by
conjectynge and by supposynge . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.470

For we shul suppose that they shul come to a wikked ende , by cause that
the Book of Decrees seith , ' Seelden , or with greet peyne , been
causes ybroght to good ende whanne they been baddely bigonne . '
CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.471

Now , sire , if men wolde axe me why that God suffred men to do yow this
vileynye , certes , I kan nat wel answere , as for no soothfastnesse .
CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.472

For th'@ @apostle seith that ' the sciences and the juggementz of oure
Lord God almyghty been ful depe ; CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.473

ther may no man comprehende ne serchen hem suffisantly . '
CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.474

Nathelees , by certeyne presumpciouns and conjectynges , I holde and
bileeve that God , which that is ful of justice and of rightwisnesse ,
hath suffred this bityde by juste cause resonable .
CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.475

" Thy name is Melibee ; this is to seyn , ' a man that drynketh hony .
' CMCTMELI-M3,229.C1.476

Thou hast ydronke so muchel hony of sweete temporeel <P_229.C2>
richesses , and delices and honours of this world , that thou art
dronken CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.477

and hast forgeten Jhesu Crist thy creatour . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.478

Thou ne hast nat doon to hym swich honour and reverence as thee oughte ,
CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.479

ne thou ne hast nat wel ytaken kep to the wordes of Ovide , that seith ,
' Under the hony of the goodes of the body is hyd the venym that sleeth
the soule . ' CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.480

And Salomon seith , ' If thou hast founden hony , ete of it that
suffiseth , CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.481

for if thou ete of it out of mesure , thou shalt spewe , ' and be nedy
and povre . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.482

And peraventure Crist hath thee in despit , CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.483

and hath turned awey fro thee his face and his eeris of misericorde ,
CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.484

and also he hath suffred that thou hast been punysshed in the manere
that thow hast ytrespassed . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.485

Thou hast doon synne agayn oure Lord Crist , CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.486

for certes , the three enemys of mankynde - that is to seyn , the flessh
, the feend , and the world - thou hast suffred hem entre in to thyn
herte wilfully by the wyndowes of thy body , CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.487

and hast nat defended thyself suffisantly agayns hire assautes and hire
temptaciouns , so that they han wounded thy soule in fyve places ; this
is to seyn , the deedly synnes that been entred into thyn herte by thy
fyve wittes . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.488

And in the same manere oure Lord Crist hath woold and suffred that thy
three enemys been entred into thyn house by the wyndowes , and han
ywounded thy doghter in the forseyde manere . " CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.489

" Certes , " quod Melibee , " I se wel that ye enforce yow muchel by
wordes to overcome me in swich manere that I shal nat venge me of myne
enemys , shewynge me the perils and the yveles that myghten falle of
this vengeance . CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.490

But whoso wolde considere in alle vengeances the perils and yveles that
myghte sewe of vengeance-takynge , a man wolde nevere take vengeance ,
CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.491

and that were harm ; CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.492

for by the vengeance-takynge been the wikked men dissevered fro the
goode men , CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.493

and they that han wyl to do wikkednesse restreyne hir wikked purpos ,
whan they seen the punyssynge and chastisynge of the trespassours . "
CMCTMELI-M3,229.C2.494

<P_230.C1>

<em> et a ce respont dame Prudence , " Certes , " dist elle , " je
t'ottroye que de vengence vient molt de maulx et de biens ; Mais
vengence n'appartient pas a un chascun fors seulement aux juges et a
ceulx qui ont la juridicion sur les malfaitteurs . <$$em>
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.496

and yet seye I moore , that right as singuler persone synneth in takynge
vengeance of another man , right so synneth the juge if he do no
vengeance of hem that it han disserved . CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.497

For senec seith thus : CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.498

' That maister , ' he seith , ' is good that proveth shrewes . '
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.499

And as cassidore seith , ' A man dredeth to do outrages whan he woot and
knoweth that it despleseth to the juges and the sovereyns . '
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.500

And another seith , ' The juge that dredeth to do right , maketh men
shrewes . ' CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.501

And Seint Paul the Apostle seith in his Epistle , whan he writeth unto
the Romayns , that ' the juges beren nat the spere withouten cause ,
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.502

but they beren it to punysse the shrewes and mysdoers , and for to
defende the goode men . ' CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.503

If ye wol thanne take vengeance of youre enemys , ye shul retourne or
have youre recours to the juge that hath the jurisdiccion upon hem ,
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.504

and he shal punysse hem as the lawe axeth and requireth . "
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.505

" A ! " quod Melibee , " this vengeance liketh me no thyng .
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.506

I bithenke me now and take heede how Fortune hath norissed me fro my

CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.507

now wol I assayen hire , trowynge , with goddes help , that she shal
helpe me my shame for to venge . " CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.508

" Certes , " quod Prudence , " if ye wol werke by my conseil , ye shul
nat assaye fortune by no wey , CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.509

ne ye shul nat lene or bowe unto hire , after the word of Senec ,
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.510

for ' thynges that been folily doon , and that been in hope of fortune ,
shullen nevere come to good ende . ' CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.511

And , as the same Senec seith , ' The moore cleer and the moore shynyng
that Fortune is , the moore brotil and the sonner broken she is . '
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.512

Trusteth nat in hire , CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.513

for she n@ @ys nat stidefast ne stable , CMCTMELI-M3,230.C1.514

for whan thow <P_230.C2> trowest to be moost seur or siker of hire help
, she wol faille thee and deceyve thee . CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.515

and where as ye seyn that Fortune hath norissed yow fro youre childhede
, I seye that in so muchel shul ye the lasse truste in hire and in hir
wit . CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.516

For Senec seith , ' What man that is norissed by Fortune , she maketh
hym a greet fool . ' CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.517

Now thanne , syn ye desire and axe vengeance , and the vengeance that is
doon after the lawe and bifore the juge ne liketh yow nat , and the
vengeance that is doon in hope of Fortune is perilous and uncertein ,
thanne have ye noon oother remedie but for to have youre recours unto
the sovereyn Juge that vengeth alle vileynyes and wronges .
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.518

And he shal venge yow after that hymself witnesseth , where as he seith
, ' Leveth the vengeance to me , CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.519

and I shal do it . ' " CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.520

Melibee answerde , " If I ne venge me nat of the vileynye that men han
doon to me , I sompne or warne hem that han doon to me that vileynye ,
and alle othere , to do me another vileynye . CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.521

For it is writen , ' if thou take no vengeance of an oold vileynye ,
thou sompnest thyne adversaries to do thee a newe vileynye . '
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.522

And also for my suffrance men wolden do me so muchel vileynye that I
myghte neither bere it ne susteene , CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.523

and so sholde I been put and holden overlowe . CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.524

For men seyn , ' In muchel suffrynge shul manye thynges falle unto thee
whiche thou shalt nat mowe suffre . ' " CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.525

" Certes , " quod Prudence , " I graunte yow that over-muchel suffraunce
is nat good . CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.526

But yet ne folweth it nat therof that every persone to whom men doon
vileynye take of it vengeance , CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.527

for that aperteneth and longeth al oonly to the juges ,
CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.528

for they shul venge the vileynyes and injuries . CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.529

And therfore tho two auctoritees that ye han seyd above been oonly
understonden in the juges , CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.530

for whan they suffren over-muchel the wronges and the vileynyes to be

Also a wys man seith that ' the juge that correcteth nat the synnere
comandeth and biddeth hym do synne . ' CMCTMELI-M3,230.C2.533

And the juges and sovereyns myghten in hir land so muchel suffre of the
shrewes and mysdoeres that they <P_231.C1> sholden , by swich suffrance
, by proces of tyme wexen of swich power and myght that they sholden
putte out the juges and the sovereyns from hir places , and at@ @te

" But lat us now putte that ye have leve to venge yow .
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.535

I seye ye been nat of myght and power as now to venge yow ,
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.536

for if ye wole maken comparisoun unto the myght of youre adversaries ,
ye shul fynde in manye thynges that I have shewed yow er this that hire

And therfore seye I that it is good as now that ye suffre and be pacient
. CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.538

" Forthermoore , ye knowen wel that after the comune sawe , ' it is a
woodnesse a man to stryve with a strenger or a moore myghty man than he
is hymself , CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.539

and for to stryve with a man of evene strengthe - that is to seyn , with
as strong a man as he is - it is peril , CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.540

and for to stryve with a weyker man , it is folie . '
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.541

And therfore sholde a man flee stryvynge as muchel as he myghte .
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.542

For Salomon seith , ' It is a greet worshipe to a man to kepen hym fro
noyse and stryf . ' CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.543

And if it so bifalle or happe that a man of gretter myght and strengthe
than thou art do thee grevaunce , studie and bisye thee rather to stille
the same grevaunce than for to venge thee . CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.544

For Senec seith that ' he putteth hym in greet peril that stryveth with
a gretter man than he is hymself . ' CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.545

And Catoun seith , ' If a man of hyer estaat or degree , or moore myghty
than thou , do thee anoy or grevaunce , suffre hym ,
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.546

for he that oones hath greved thee , may another tyme releeve thee and
helpe . ' CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.547

yet sette I caas , ye have bothe myght and licence for to venge yow ,
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.548

I seye that ther be ful manye thynges that shul restreyne yow of
vengeance-takynge and make yow for to enclyne to suffre , and for to han
pacience in the wronges that han been doon to yow .
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.549

First and foreward , if ye wole considere the defautes that been in
youre owene persone , for whiche defautes God hath suffred yow have this
tribulacioun , as I have seyd yow heer-biforn . CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.550

For the poete seith that ' we oghte paciently taken the tribulacions
that comen to us , whan we thynken and consideren that we han disserved
to have hem . ' CMCTMELI-M3,231.C1.551

and Seint Gregorie <P_231.C2> seith that ' whan a man considereth wel
the nombre of his defautes and of his synnes , the peynes and the
tribulaciouns that he suffreth semen the lesse unto hym ;
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.552

and in as muche as hym thynketh his synnes moore hevy and grevous , in
so muche semeth his peyne the lighter and the esier unto hym . '
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.553

Also ye owen to enclyne and bowe youre herte to take the pacience of
oure Lord Jhesu Crist , as seith Seint Peter in his Epistles .
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.554

' Jhesu Crist , ' he seith , ' hath suffred for us and yeven ensample to
every man to folwe and sewe hym , CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.555

for he dide nevere synne , CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.556

ne nevere cam ther a vileyns word out of his mouth .
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.557

Whan men cursed hym , he cursed hem noght , CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.558

and whan men betten hym , he manaced hem noght . '
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.559

Also the grete pacience which the seintes that been in Paradys han had
in tribulaciouns that they han ysuffred , withouten hir desert or gilt ,
oghte muchel stiren yow to pacience . CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.560

Forthermoore ye sholde enforce yow to have pacience , considerynge that
the tribulaciouns of this world but litel while endure
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.561

and soone passed been and goon , CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.562

and the joye that a man seketh to have by pacience in tribulaciouns is
perdurable , after that the Apostle seith in his epistle .
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.563

' The joye of God , ' he seith , ' is perdurable - ' that is to seyn ,
everelastynge . CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.564

Also troweth and bileveth stedefastly that he n@ @ys nat wel ynorissed ,
ne wel ytaught , that kan nat have pacience , or wol nat receyve
pacience . CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.565

For Salomon seith that ' the doctrine and the wit of a man is knowen by
pacience . ' CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.566

And in another place he seith that ' he that is pacient governeth hym by
greet prudence . ' CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.567

And the same Salomon seith , ' The angry and wrathful man maketh noyses
, CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.568

and the pacient man atempreth hem and stilleth . '
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.569

He seith also , ' It is moore worth to be pacient than for to be right
strong ; CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.570

and he that may have the lordshipe of his owene herte is moore to preyse
than he that by his force or strengthe taketh grete citees . '
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.571

And therfore seith Seint Jame in his Epistle that ' pacience is a greet
vertu of perfeccioun . CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.572

" Certes , " quod Melibee , " I graunte yow , dame Prudence , that
pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun ; CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.573

but every man may nat have the perfeccioun that ye seken ;
CMCTMELI-M3,231.C2.574

ne I n@ @am <P_232.C1> nat of the nombre of right parfite men ,
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.575

for myn herte may nevere been in pees unto the tyme it be venged .
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.576

And al be it so that it was greet peril to myne enemys to do me a
vileynye in takynge vengeance upon me , yet tooken they noon heede of
the peril , CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.577

but fulfilleden hir wikked wyl and hir corage . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.578

And therfore me thynketh men oghten nat repreve me , though I putte me
in a litel peril for to venge me , and though I do a greet excesse ;
that is to seyn , that I venge oon outrage by another . "
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.579

" A , " quod dame Prudence , " ye seyn youre wyl and as yow liketh ,
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.580

but in no caas of the world a man sholde nat doon outrage ne excesse for
to vengen hym . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.581

For Cassidore seith that ' as yvele dooth he that vengeth hym by outrage
as he that dooth the outrage . ' CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.582

And therfore ye shul venge yow after the ordre of right ; that is to
seyn , by the lawe and noght by excesse ne by outrage .
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.583

And also , if ye wol venge yow of the outrage of youre adversaries in
oother manere than {COM:that_you_should_venge_yourself_in} right
comandeth , ye synnen . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.584

And therfore seith Senec that ' a man shal nevere vengen shrewednesse by
shrewednesse . ' CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.585

And if ye seye that right axeth a man to defenden violence by violence
and fightyng by fightyng , certes ye seye sooth , whan the defense is
doon anon withouten intervalle or withouten tariyng or delay , for to
deffenden hym and nat for to vengen hym . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.586

And it bihoveth that a man putte swich attemperance in his deffense that
men have no cause ne matiere to repreven hym that deffendeth hym of
excesse and outrage , CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.587

for ellis were it agayn resoun . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.588

Pardee , ye knowen wel that ye maken no deffense as now for to deffende
yow , but for to venge yow ; CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.589

and so seweth it that ye han no wyl to do youre dede attemprely .
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.590

And therfore me thynketh that pacience is good . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.591

For Salomon seith that ' he that is nat pacient shal have greet harm .
' " CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.592

" Certes , " quod Melibee , " I graunte yow that whan a man is inpacient
and wrooth of that that toucheth hym noght and that aperteneth nat unto
hym , though it harme hym , it is no wonder . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C1.593

For the lawe seith that ' he is coupable that entremetteth hym or
medleth with swych thyng as aperteneth nat <P_232.C2> unto hym . '
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.594

And Salomon seith that ' he that entremetteth hym of the noyse or strif
of another man is lyk to hym that taketh an hound by the eris . '
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.595

For right as he that taketh a straunge hound by the eris is outherwhile
biten with the hound , right in the same wise is it resoun that he have
harm that by his inpacience medleth hym of the noyse of another man ,
wher@ @as it aperteneth nat unto hym . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.596

But ye knowen wel that this dede that is to seyn , my grief and my
disese - toucheth me right ny . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.597

And therfore , though I be wrooth and inpacient , it is no merveille .
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.598

And , savynge youre grace , I kan nat seen that it myghte greetly harme
me though I tooke vengeaunce . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.599

For I am richer and moore myghty than myne enemys been ;
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.600

and wel knowen ye that by moneye and by havynge grete possessions been
alle the thynges of this world governed . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.601

And Salomon seith that ' alle thynges obeyen to moneye . ' "
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.602

Whan Prudence hadde herd hir housbonde avanten hym of his richesse and
of his moneye , dispreisynge the power of his adversaries , she spak ,
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.603

and seyde in this wise : CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.604

" Certes , deere sire , I graunte yow that ye been riche and myghty and
that the richesses been goode to hem that han wel ygeten hem and wel
konne usen hem . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.605

For right as the body of a man may nat lyven withoute the soule ,
namoore may it lyve withouten temporeel goodes . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.606

And by richesses may a man gete hym grete freendes .
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.607

And therfore seith Pamphilles : ' If a net-herdes doghter , ' seith he ,
' be riche , she may chesen of a_thousand men which she wol take to hir
housbonde , CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.608

for , of a_thousand men , oon wol nat forsaken hire ne refusen hire . '
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.609

And this Pamphilles seith also , ' If thow be right happy - that is to
seyn , if thou be right riche - thou shalt fynde a greet nombre of
felawes and freendes . CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.610

And if thy fortune change that thou wexe povre , farewel freendshipe and
felaweshipe , CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.611

for thou shalt be alloone withouten any compaignye , but if it be the
compaignye of povre folk . ' CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.612

And yet seith this Pamphilles moreover that ' they that been thralle and
bonde of lynage shullen been maad worthy and noble by the richesses . '
CMCTMELI-M3,232.C2.613

And right so as by richesses ther comen manye goodes , right so
<P_233.C1> by poverte come ther manye harmes and yveles ,
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.614

for greet poverte constreyneth a man to do manye yveles .
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.615

And therfore clepeth Cassidore poverte the mooder of ruyne ; that is to
seyn , the mooder of overthrowynge or fallynge doun .
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.616

And therfore seith Piers Alfonce , ' Oon of the gretteste adversitees of
this world is whan a free man by kynde or of burthe is constreyned by
poverte to eten the almesse of his enemy , ' CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.617

and the same seith Innocent in oon of his bookes .
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.618

He seith that ' sorweful and myshappy is the condicioun of a povre
beggere ; CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.619

for if he axe nat his mete , he dyeth for hunger ;
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.620

and if he axe , he dyeth for shame ; CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.621

and algates necessitee constreyneth hym to axe . '
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.622

And seith Salomon that ' bet it is to dye than for to have swich poverte
. ' CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.623

And as the same Salomon seith , ' Bettre it is to dye of bitter deeth
than for to lyven in swich wise . ' CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.624

By thise resons that I have seid unto yow , and by manye othere resons
that I koude seye , I graunte yow that richesses been goode to hem that
geten hem wel , and to hem that wel usen tho richesses .
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.625

and therfore wol I shewe yow hou ye shul have yow , and how ye shul bere
yow in gaderynge of richesses , and in what manere ye shul usen hem .
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.626

" First , ye shul geten hem withouten greet desir , by good leyser ,
sokyngly and nat over-hastily . CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.627

For a man that is to desirynge to gete richesses abaundoneth hym first
to thefte , and to alle othere yveles ; CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.628

and therfore seith Salomon , ' He that hasteth hym to bisily to wexe
riche shal be noon innocent . ' CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.629

He seith also that ' the richesses that hastily cometh to a man soone
and lightly gooth and passeth fro a man , but that richesse that cometh
litel and litel wexeth alwey and multiplieth . ' CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.630

And , sire , ye shul geten richesses by youre wit and by youre travaille
unto youre profit , and that withouten wrong or harm doynge to any
oother persone . CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.631

for the lawe seith that ' ther maketh no man himselven riche , if he do
harm to another wight . ' CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.632

This is to seyn , that nature deffendeth and forbedeth by right that no
man make hymself riche unto the harm of another persone .
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C1.633

<P_233.C2>

And Tullius seith that ' no sorwe , ne no drede of deeth , ne no thyng
that may falle unto a man , is so muchel agayns nature as a man to
encressen his owene profit to the harm of another man .
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.635

And though the grete men and the myghty men geten richesses moore
lightly than thou , yet shal@ @tou nat been ydel ne slow to do thy
profit , CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.636

for thou shalt in alle wise flee ydelnesse . ' CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.637

For Salomon seith that ' ydelnesse techeth a man to do manye yveles . '
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.638

And the same Salomon seith that ' he that travailleth and bisieth hym to
tilien his land shal eten breed , but he that is ydel and casteth hym to
no bisynesse ne occupacioun shal falle into poverte and dye for hunger .
' CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.639

And he that is ydel and slow kan nevere fynde covenable tyme for to doon
his profit . CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.640

For ther is a versifiour seith that ' the ydel man excuseth hym in
wynter by cause of the grete coold , and in somer by enchesoun of the
greete heete . ' CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.641

For thise causes seith Caton , ' Waketh CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.642

and enclyneth nat yow over-muchel for to slepe , CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.643

for overmuchel reste norisseth and causeth manye vices . '
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.644

And therfore seith Seint Jerome , ' Dooth somme goode dedes that the
devel , which is oure enemy , ne fynde yow nat unocupied . '
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.645

For the devel ne taketh nat lightly unto his werkynge swiche as he
fyndeth occupied in goode werkes . CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.646

" Thanne thus in getynge richesses ye mosten flee ydelnesse .
CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.647

And afterward , ye shul use the richesses which ye have geten by youre
wit and by youre travaille in swich a manere that men holde yow nat to
scars , ne to sparynge , ne to fool-large - that is to seyen ,
over-large a spendere . CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.648

For right as men blamen an avaricious man by cause of his scarsetee and
chyncherie , in the same wise is he to blame that spendeth over-largely
. CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.649

And therfore seith Caton : ' Use , ' he seith , ' thy richesses that
thou hast geten in swich a manere that men have no matiere ne cause to
calle thee neither wrecche ne chynche , CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.650

for it is a greet shame to a man to have a povere herte and a riche purs
. ' CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.651

He seith also , ' The goodes that thou hast ygeten , use hem by mesure ;
' that is to seyn , spende hem mesurably , CMCTMELI-M3,233.C2.652

<P_234.C1>

for they that folily wasten and despenden the goodes that they han ,
whan they han namoore propre of hir owene , they shapen hem to take the
goodes of another man . CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.654

I seye thanne that ye shul fleen avarice , usynge youre richesses in
swich manere that men seye nat that youre richesses been yburyed , but
that ye have hem in youre myght and in youre weeldynge .
CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.655

For a wys man repreveth the avaricious man , CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.656

and seith thus in two vers : CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.657

' Wherto and why burieth a man his goodes by his grete avarice , and
knoweth wel that nedes moste he dye ? CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.658

For deeth is the ende of every man as in this present lyf . '
CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.659

And for what cause or enchesoun joyneth he hym or knytteth he hym so
faste unto his goodes that alle hise wittes mowen nat disseveren hym or
departen hym from his goodes , and knoweth wel , or oghte knowe , that
whan he is deed he shal no thyng bere with hym out of this world ?
CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.660

And therfore seith Seint Austyn that ' the avaricious man is likned unto
helle , that the moore it swelweth the moore desir it hath to swelwe and
devoure . ' CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.661

And as wel as ye wolde eschewe to be called an avaricious man or chynche
, as wel sholde ye kepe yow and governe yow in swich a wise that men
calle yow nat fool-large . CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.662

Therfore seith Tullius : ' The goodes , ' he seith , ' of thyn hous ne
sholde nat been hyd ne kept so cloos , but that they myghte been opened
by pitee and debonairetee ' <paren> that is to seyn , to yeven part to
hem that han greet nede , <$$paren> ' CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.663

ne thy goodes shullen nat been so opene to been every mannes goodes . '
CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.664

Afterward , in getynge of youre richesses and in usynge hem , ye shul
alwey have thre thynges in youre herte <paren> that is to seyn , oure
Lord God , conscience , and good name <$$paren> .
CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.665

First , ye shul have God in youre herte , CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.666

and for no richesse ye shullen do no thyng which may in any manere
displese God , that is youre creatour and makere .
CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.667

For after the word of Salomon , ' It is bettre to have a litel good with
the love of God than to have muchel good and tresour and lese the love
of his Lord God . ' CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.668

And the prophete seith that ' bettre it is to been a good man and have
litel good and tresour than to been holden a shrewe and have grete
richesses . ' CMCTMELI-M3,234.C1.669

And yet seye <P_234.C2> I ferthermoore , that ye sholde alwey doon youre
bisynesse to gete yow richesses , so that ye gete hem with good
conscience . CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.670

And th'@ @Apostle seith that ' ther n@ @ys thyng in this world of which
we sholden have so greet joye as {we_should_have} whan oure conscience
bereth us good witnesse . ' CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.671

and the wise man seith , ' The substance of a man is ful good , whan
synne is nat in mannes conscience . ' CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.672

Afterward , in getynge of youre richesses and in usynge of hem , yow
moste have greet bisynesse and greet diligence that youre goode name be
alwey kept and conserved . CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.673

For Salomon seith that ' bettre it is and moore it availleth a man to
have a good name than for to have grete richesses . '
CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.674

And therfore he seith in another place , ' Do greet diligence , ' seith
Salomon , ' in kepyng of thy freend and of thy goode name ;
CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.675

for it shal lenger abide with thee than any tresour , be it never so
precious . ' CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.676

And certes he sholde nat be called a gentil man that after God and good
conscience , alle thynges left , ne dooth his diligence and bisynesse to
kepen his goode name . CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.677

And Cassidore seith that ' it is signe of a gentil herte whan a man
loveth and desireth to han a good name . ' CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.678

And therfore seith Seint Austyn that ' ther been two thynges that arn
necessarie and nedefulle , CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.679

and that is good conscience and good loos ; that is to seyn , good
conscience to thyn owene persone inward and good loos for thy neighebor
outward . ' CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.680

And he that trusteth hym so muchel in his goode conscience that he
displeseth , and setteth at noght his goode name or loos , and rekketh
noght though he kepe nat his goode name , n@ @ys but a crueel cherl .
CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.681

" Sire , now have I shewed yow how ye shul do in getynge richesses , and
how ye shullen usen hem , CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.682

and I se wel that for the trust that ye han in youre richesses ye wole
moeve werre and bataille . CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.683

I conseille yow that ye bigynne no werre in trust of youre richesses ,
CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.684

for they ne suffisen noght werres to mayntene . CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.685

And therfore seith a philosophre , ' That man that desireth and wole
algates han werre , shal nevere have suffisaunce ,
CMCTMELI-M3,234.C2.686

for the richer that he is , the gretter despenses moste he make , if he
wole have worshipe <P_235.C1> and victorie . ' CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.687

And Salomon seith that ' the gretter richesses that a man hath , the mo
despendours he hath . ' CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.688

And , deere sire , al be it so that for youre richesses ye mowe have
muchel folk , yet bihoveth it nat , ne it is nat good , to bigynne werre
where@ @as ye mowe in oother manere have pees unto youre worshipe and
profit . CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.689

For the victorie of batailles that been in this world lyth nat in greet
nombre or multitude of the peple , ne in the vertu of man ,
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.690

but it lith in the wyl and in the hand of oure Lord God Almyghty .
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.691

And therfore Judas Machabeus , which was goddes knyght , whan he sholde
fighte agayn his adversarie that hadde a gretter nombre and a gretter
multitude of folk and strenger than was this peple of Machabee , yet he
reconforted his litel compaignye , CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.692

and seyde right in this wise : CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.693

' Als lightly , ' quod he , ' may oure Lord God Almyghty yeve victorie
to a fewe folk as to many folk , CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.694

for the victorie of a bataile comth nat by the grete nombre of peple ,
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.695

but it cometh from oure Lord God of hevene . ' CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.696

And , deere sire , for as muchel as ther is no man certein if he be
worthy that God yeve hym victorie , <em> ne plus que il est certain se
il est digne de l'amour de dieu <$$em> , or naught , after that Salomon
seith , therfore every man sholde greetly drede werres to bigynne .
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.697

And by cause that in batailles fallen manye perils , and happeth outher
while that as soone is the grete man slayn as the litel man ; and as it
is writen in the seconde Book of Kynges , ' The dedes of batailles been
aventurouse and nothyng certeyne , for as lightly is oon hurt with a
spere as another ' ; and for ther is gret peril in werre , therfore
sholde a man flee and eschue werre , in as muchel as a man may goodly .
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.698

For Salomon seith , ' He that loveth peril shal falle in peril . ' "
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.699

After that Dame Prudence hadde spoken in this manere , Melibee answerde
, CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.700

and seyde , " I see wel , dame Prudence , that by youre faire wordes ,
and by youre resouns that ye han shewed me , that the werre liketh yow
no thyng ; CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.701

but I have nat yet herd youre conseil , how I shal do in this nede . "
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C1.702

<P_235.C2>

" Certes , " quod she , " I conseille yow that ye accorde with youre
adversaries and that ye have pees with hem . CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.704

For Seint Jame seith in his Epistles that ' by concord and pees the
smale richesses wexen grete , and by debaat and discord the grete
richesses fallen doun . ' CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.705

And ye knowen wel that oon of the gretteste and moost sovereyn thyng
that is in this world is unytee and pees . CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.706

And therfore seyde oure Lord Jhesu Crist to his apostles in this wise :
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.707

' Wel happy and blessed been they that loven and purchacen pees ,
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.708

for they been called children of God . ' " CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.709

" A , " quod Melibee , " now se I wel that ye loven nat myn honour ne my
worshipe . CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.710

Ye knowen wel that myne adversaries han bigonnen this debaat and bryge
by hire outrage , CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.711

and ye se wel that they ne requeren ne preyen me nat of pees , ne they
asken nat to be reconsiled . CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.712

Wol ye thanne that I go and meke me and obeye me to hem , and crie hem
mercy ? CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.713

For sothe , that were nat my worshipe . CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.714

For right as men seyn that ' over-greet hoomlynesse engendreth
dispreisynge , ' so fareth it by to greet hymylitee or mekenesse . "
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.715

Thanne bigan dame Prudence to maken semblant of wratthe ,
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.716

and seyde : " Certes , sire , sauf youre grace , I love youre honour and
youre profit as I do myn owene , CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.717

and evere have doon ; CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.718

ne ye , ne noon oother , seyn nevere the contrarie .
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.719

And yit if I hadde seyd that ye sholde han purchaced the pees and the
reconsilacioun , I ne hadde nat muchel mystaken me , ne seyd amys .
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.720

For the wise man seith , ' The dissensioun bigynneth by another man ,
CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.721

and the reconsilyng bygynneth by thyself . ' CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.722

and the prophete seith , ' Flee shrewednesse CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.723

and do goodnesse ; CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.724

seke pees CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.725

and folwe it , as muchel as in thee is . ' CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.726

Yet seye I nat that ye shul rather pursue to youre adversaries for pees
than they shuln to yow . CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.727

For I knowe wel that ye been so hard-herted that ye wol do no thyng for
me . CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.728

And Salomon seith , ' He that hath over-hard an herte , at@ @te laste he
shal myshappe and mystyde . ' " CMCTMELI-M3,235.C2.729

<P_236.C1>

Whanne Melibee hadde herd dame Prudence maken semblant of wratthe , he
seyde in this wise : CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.731

" Dame , I prey yow that ye be nat displesed of thynges that I seye ,
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.732

for ye knowe wel that I am angrey and wrooth , CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.733

and that is no wonder ; CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.734

and they that been wrothe witen nat wel what they don , ne what they
seyn . CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.735

Therfore the prophete seith that ' troubled eyen han no cleer sighte .
' CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.736

but seyeth and conseileth me as yow liketh , CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.737

for I am redy to do right as ye wol desire ; CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.738

and if ye repreve me of my folye , I am the moore holden to love yow and
to preyse yow . CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.739

For Salomon seith that ' he that repreveth hym that dooth folye , he
shal fynde gretter grace than he that deceyveth hym by sweete wordes .
' " CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.740

Thanne seide dame Prudence , " I make no semblant of wratthe ne anger ,
but for youre grete profit . CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.741

For Salomon seith , ' He is moore worth that repreveth or chideth a fool
for his folye , shewynge hym semblant of wratthe , than he that
supporteth hym and preyseth hym in his mysdoynge , and laugheth at his
folye . ' CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.742

and this same Salomon seith afterward that ' by the sorweful visage of a
man , ' <paren> that is to seyn by the sory and hevy contenaunce of a
man <$$paren> ' the fool correcteth and amendeth hymself . ' "
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.743

Thanne seyde Melibee , " I shal nat koone answere to so manye faire
resouns as ye putten to me and shewen . CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.744

Seyeth shorthly youre wyl and youre conseil , CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.745

and I am al redy to fulfille and parfourne it . "
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.746

Thanne dame Prudence discovered al hir wyl to hym ,
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.747

and seyde , " I conseille yow , " quod she , " aboven alle thynges ,
that ye make pees bitwene God and yow , and beth reconsiled unto hym and
to his grace . CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.748

For , as I have seyd yow heer biforn , God hath suffred yow to have this
tribulacioun and disese for youre synnes . CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.749

and if ye do as I sey yow , God wol sende youre adversaries unto yow ,
and maken hem fallen at youre feet , redy to do youre wyl and youre
comandementz . CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.750

For Salomon seith , ' Whan the condicioun of man is plesaunt and likynge
to God , he chaungeth the hertes of the mannes adversaries
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.751

and constreyneth hem to biseken hym of pees and of grace . '
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C1.752

And I prey yow lat me speke with youre adversaries <P_236.C2> in privee
place , CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.753

for they shul nat knowe that it be of youre wyl or of youre assent .
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.754

And thanne , whan I knowe hir wil and hire entente , I may conseille yow
the moore seurely . " CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.755

" Dame , " quod Melibee , " dooth youre wil and youre likynge ;
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.756

for I putte me hoolly in youre disposicioun and ordinaunce . "
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.757

Thanne dame Prudence , whan she saugh the goode wyl of hir housbonde ,
delibered and took avys in hirself , thinkinge how she myghte brynge
this nede unto a good conclusioun and to a good ende .
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.758

And whan she saugh hir tyme , she sente for thise adversaries to come
unto hire into a pryvee place CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.759

and shewed wisely unto hem the grete goodes that comen of pees , and the
grete harmes and perils that been in werre , CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.760

and seyde to hem in a goodly manere hou that hem oughten have greet
repentaunce of the injurie and wrong that they hadden doon to Melibee
hir Lord , and unto hire , and to hire doghter . CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.761

And whan they herden the goodliche wordes of dame Prudence , they weren
so supprised and ravysshed , and hadden so greet joye of hire that
wonder was to telle . CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.762

" A , lady , " quod they , " ye han shewed unto us the blessynge of
swetnesse , after the sawe of David the prophete ,
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.763

for the reconsilynge which we been nat worthy to have in no manere , but
we oghte requeren it with greet contricioun and humylitee , ye of youre
grete goodnesse have presented unto us . CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.764

Now se we wel that the science and the konnynge of Salomon is ful trewe
. CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.765

For he seith that ' sweete wordes multiplien and encreescen freendes
CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.766

and maken shrewes to be debonaire and meeke . ' CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.767

" Certes , " quod they , " we putten oure dede and al oure matere and

and been redy to obeye to the speche and comandement of my Lord Melibee
. CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.769

And therfore , deere and benygne lady , we preien yow and biseke yow as
mekely as we konne and mowen , that it lyke unto youre grete goodnesse
to fulfillen in dede youre goodliche wordes , CMCTMELI-M3,236.C2.770

for we consideren and knowelichen that we han offended and greved my
Lord Melibee out of mesure , so ferforth <P_237.C1> that we be nat of
power to maken his amendes . CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.771

And therfore we oblige and bynden us and oure freendes for to doon al
his wyl and his comandementz . CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.772

But peraventure he hath swich hevynesse and swich wratthe to us-ward ,
by cause of oure offense , that he wole enjoyne us swich a peyne as we
mowe nat bere ne susteene . CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.773

And therfore , noble lady , we biseke to youre wommanly pitee to taken
swich avysement in this nede that we , ne oure freendes , be nat
desherited ne destroyed thurgh oure folye . " CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.774

" Certes , " quod Prudence , " it is an hard thyng and right perilous
that a man putte hym al outrely in the arbitracioun and juggement , and
in the myght and power of his enemys . CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.775

For Salomon seith , ' Leeveth me , CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.776

and yeveth credence to that I shal seyn : CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.777

I seye , ' quod he , ' ye peple , folk and governours of hooly chirche ,

thou nevere myght ne maistrie of thy body whil thou lyvest . '
CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.778

now sithen he deffendeth that man sholde nat yeven to his broother ne to
his freend the myght of his body , by a strenger resoun he deffendeth
and forbedeth a man to yeven hymself to his enemy .
CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.779

And nathelees I conseille you that ye mystruste nat my lord ,
CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.780

for I woot wel and knowe verraily that he is debonaire and meeke , large
, curteys , and nothyng desirous ne coveitous of good ne richesse .
CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.781

For ther n@ @ys nothyng in this world that he desireth , save oonly
worshipe and honour . CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.782

Forthermoore I knowe wel and am right seur that he shal nothyng doon in
this nede withouten my conseil , CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.783

and I shal so werken in this cause that , by the grace of oure Lord God
, ye shul been reconsiled unto us . " CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.784

Thanne seyden they with o voys , " Worshipful lady , we putten us and
oure goodes al fully in youre wil and disposicioun ,
CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.785

and been redy to comen , what day that it like unto youre noblesse to
lymyte us or assigne us , for to maken oure obligacioun and boond as
strong as it liketh unto youre goodnesse , that we mowe fulfille the
wille of yow and of my lord Melibee . " CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.786

Whan dame Prudence hadde herd the answeres of thise men , she bad hem
goon agayn prively ; CMCTMELI-M3,237.C1.787

<P_237.C2>

and she retourned to hir lord Melibee , CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.789

and tolde hym how she foond his adversaries ful repentant ,
knowelechynge ful lowely hir synnes and trespas , and how they were redy
to suffren al peyne , requirynge and preiynge hym of mercy and pitee .
CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.790

Thanne seyde Melibee : " He is wel worthy to have pardoun and
foryifnesse of his synne , that excuseth nat his synne but knowelecheth
it and repenteth hym , axinge indulgence . CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.791

For Senec seith , ' Ther is the remissioun and foryifnesse , where as
the confessioun is , ' CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.792

for confessioun is neighebor to innocence . CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.793

And he seith in another place that ' he that hath shame of his synne and
knowlecheth <em> it , is worthy remissioun <$$em> . '
CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.794

And therfore I assente and conferme me to have pees ;
CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.795

but it is good that we do it nat withouten the assent and wyl of oure
freendes . " CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.796

Thanne was Prudence right glad and joyeful , CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.797

and seyde : Certes , sire , " quod she , " ye han wel and goodly
answered , CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.798

for right as by the conseil , assent , and help of youre freendes ye han
been stired to venge yow and maken werre , right so withouten hire
conseil shul ye nat accorden yow ne have pees with youre adversaries .
CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.799

For the lawe seith : ' Ther n@ @ys no thyng so good by wey of kynde as a
thyng to be unbounde by hym that it was ybounde . ' "
CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.800

And thanne dame Prudence , withouten delay or tariynge , sente anon hire
messages for hire kyn , and for hire olde freendes which that were trewe
and wyse , CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.801

and tolde hem by ordre in the presence of Melibee al this mateere as it
is aboven expressed and declared , CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.802

and preyden hem that they wolde yeven hire avys and conseil what best
were to doon in this nede . CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.803

And whan Melibees freendes hadde taken hire avys and deliberacioun of
the forseide mateere , and hadden examyned it by greet bisynesse and
greet diligence , they yave ful conseil for to have pees and reste , and
that Melibee sholde receyve with good herte his adversaries to
foryifnesse and mercy . CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.804

And whan dame Prudence hadde herd the assent of hir lord Melibee , and
the conseil of his freendes accorde with hire wille and hire entencioun
, she was wonderly glad in hire herte CMCTMELI-M3,237.C2.805

and seyde : " Ther is an old proverbe , " quod she , " seith that ' the
goodnesse that thou mayst do this day , do it , <P_328.C1> and abide nat
ne delaye it nat til tomorwe . ' CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.806

And therfore I conseille that ye sende youre messages , swiche as been
discrete and wise , unto youre adversaries , tellynge hem on youre
bihalve that if they wole trete of pees and of accord , that they shape
hem withouten delay or tariyng to comen unto us . Which thyng
parfourned was in dede . CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.807

And whanne thise trespassours and repentynge folk of hire folies , that
is to seyn , the adversaries of Melibee , hadden herd what thise
messagers seyden unto hem , they weren right glad and joyeful ,
CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.808

and answereden ful mekely and benignely , yeldynge graces and thankynges
to hir lord Melibee and to al his compaignye , CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.809

and shopen hem withouten delay to go with the messagers , and obeye to
the comandement of hir lord Melibee . CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.810

And right anon they tooken hire wey to the court of Melibee ,
CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.811

and tooken with hem somme of hire trewe freendes to maken feith for hem
and for to been hire borwes . CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.812

And whan they were comen to the presence of Melibee , he seyde hem thise
wordes : CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.813

" It standeth thus , " quod Melibee , CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.814

" and sooth it is , that ye , causelees and withouten skile and resoun ,
han doon grete injuries and wronges to me and to my wyf Prudence , and
to my doghter also . CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.815

For ye han entred into myn hous by violence , CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.816

and have doon swich outrage that alle men knowen wel that ye have
disserved the deeth . CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.817

And therfore wol I knowe and wite of yow wheither ye wol putte the
punyssement and the chastisynge and the vengeance of this outrage in the
wyl of me and of my wyf Prudence , or ye wol nat ? "
CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.818

Thanne the wiseste of hem thre answerde for hem alle
CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.819

and seyde , " Sire , " quod he , " we knowen wel that we been unworthy
to comen unto the court of so greet a lord and so worthy as ye been .
CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.820

For we han so greetly mystaken us , CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.821

and han offended and agilt in swich a wise agayn youre heigh Lordshipe ,
that trewely we han disserved the deeth . CMCTMELI-M3,328.C1.822

But yet , for the grete goodnesse and debonairetee that al the world
witnesseth of youre persone , we submytten us to the excellence and
benignitee of youre gracious <P_238.C2> lordshipe ,
CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.823

and been redy to obeie to alle youre comandementz ; bisekynge yow that
of youre merciable pitee ye wol considere oure grete repentaunce and
lowe submyssioun , and graunten us foryevenesse of oure outrageous
trespas and offense . CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.824

For wel we knowe that youre liberal grace and mercy strecchen hem
ferther into goodnesse than doon oure outrageouse giltes and trespas
into wikkednesse , al be it that cursedly and dampnablely we han agilt
agayn youre heigh lordshipe . " CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.825

Thanne Melibee took hem up fro the ground ful benignely ,
CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.826

and receyved hire obligaciouns and hir boondes by hire othes upon hire
plegges and borwes , CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.827

and assigned hem a certeyn day to retourne unto his court , for to
accepte and receyve the sentence and juggement that Melibee wolde
comande to be doon on hem by the causes aforeseyd . Whiche thynges
ordeyned , every man retourned to his hous . CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.828

And whan that dame Prudence saugh hir tyme , she freyned and axed hir
Lord Melibee what vengeance he thoughte to taken of his adversaries .
To which Melibee answerde , and seyde : " Certes , " quod he , " I
thynke and purpose me fully to desherite hem of al that evere they han ,
and for to putte hem in exil for evere . " CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.829

" Certes , " quod dame Prudence , " this were a crueel sentence and
muchel agayn resoun . CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.830

For ye been riche ynough , CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.831

and han no nede of oother mennes good , CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.832

and ye myghte lightly in this wise gete yow a coveitous name , which is
a vicious thyng , and oghte been eschued of every good man .
CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.833

For after the sawe of the word of the Apostle , ' Coveitise is roote of
alle harmes . ' CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.834

and therfore it were bettre for yow to lese so muchel good of youre
owene , than for to taken of hir good in this manere ,
CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.835

for bettre it is to lesen good with worshipe , than it is to wynne good
with vileynye and shame . CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.836

And everi man oghte to doon his diligence and his bisynesse to geten hym
a good name . CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.837

And yet shal he nat oonly bisie hym in kepynge of his good name ,
CMCTMELI-M3,238.C2.838

but he shal also enforcen hym alwey to do somthyng by <P_239.C1> which
he may renovelle his good name . CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.839

For it is writen that ' the olde good loos or good name of a man is
soone goon and passed , whan it is nat newed ne renovelled . '
CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.840

And as touchynge that ye seyn ye wole exile youre adversaries , that
thynketh me muchel agayn resoun and out of mesure , considered the power
that they han yeve yow upon hemself . CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.841

And it is writen that ' he is worthy to lesen his privilege , that
mysuseth the myght and the power that is yeven hym . '
CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.842

and I sette cas ye myghte enjoyne hem that peyne by right and by lawe ,
which I trowe ye mowe nat do ; CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.843

I seye ye mighte nat putten it to execucioun peraventure ,
CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.844

and thanne were it likly to retourne to the werre as it was biforn .
CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.845

And therfore , if ye wole that men do yow obeisance , ye moste deemen
moore curteisly ; this is to seyn , ye moste yeven moore esy sentences
and juggementz . CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.846

For it is writen that ' he that moost curteisly comandeth , to hym men
moost obeyen . ' CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.847

And therfore I prey yow that in this necessitee and in this nede ye
caste yow to overcome youre herte . CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.848

For Senec seith that ' he that overcometh his herte , overcometh twies .
' CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.849

and Tullius seith : ' Ther is no thyng so comendable in a greet lord as
whan he is debonaire and meeke , and appeseth him lightly . '
CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.850

And I prey yow that ye wole forbere now to do vengeance , in swich a
manere that youre goode name may be kept and conserved , and that men
mowe have cause and mateere to preyse yow of pitee and of mercy , and
that ye have no cause to repente yow of thyng that ye doon .
CMCTMELI-M3,239.C1.851

For Senec seith , ' He overcometh in an yvel manere that repenteth hym
of his victorie . ' <P_239.C2> Wherfore I pray yow , lat mercy been in
youre herte , to th'@ @effect and entente that God Almighty have mercy
on yow in his laste juggement . CMCTMELI-M3,239.C2.852

For Seint Jame seith in his Epistle : ' Juggement withouten mercy shal
be doon to hym that hath no mercy of another wight . ' "
CMCTMELI-M3,239.C2.853

Whanne Melibee hadde herd the grete skiles and resouns of dame Prudence
, and hire wise informaciouns and techynges , his herte gan enclyne to
the wil of his wif , considerynge hir trewe entente ,
CMCTMELI-M3,239.C2.854

and conformed hym anon CMCTMELI-M3,239.C2.855

and assented fully to werken after hir conseil , CMCTMELI-M3,239.C2.856

and thonked God , of whom procedeth al vertu and alle goodnesse , that
hym sente a wyf of so greet discrecioun . CMCTMELI-M3,239.C2.857

And whan the day cam that his adversaries sholde appieren in his
presence , he spak unto hem ful goodly , CMCTMELI-M3,239.C2.858

and seyde in this wyse : CMCTMELI-M3,239.C2.859

" Al be it so that of youre pride and heigh presumpcioun and folie , and
of youre necligence and unkonnynge , ye have mysborn yow and trespassed
unto me , yet for as muche as I see and biholde youre grete humylitee ,
and that ye been sory and repentant of youre giltes , it constreyneth me
to doon yow grace and mercy . Wherfore I receyve yow to my grace , and
foryeve yow outrely alle the offenses , injuries , and wronges that ye
have doon agayn me and myne , to this effect and to this ende that God
of his endelees mercy wole at the tyme of oure diynge foryeven us oure
giltes that we han trespassed to hym in this wrecched world .
CMCTMELI-M3,239.C2.860

For doutelees , if we be sory and repentant of the synnes and giltes
which we han trespassed in the sighte of oure Lord God , he is so free
and so merciable that he wole foryeven us oure giltes , and bryngen us
to the blisse that nevere hath ende . " CMCTMELI-M3,239.C2.861

Amen . CMCTMELI-M3,239.C2.862
