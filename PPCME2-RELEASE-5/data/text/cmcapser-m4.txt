And here begynnyth a tretis of tho orderes +tat be vndyr +te reule of
oure fader Seynt Augustin , drawe oute of a sermon seyd be frer Ion
Capgraue at Cambrige , +te +gere of our Lord a_M_cccc_xxij .
CMCAPSER-M4,145.4

<$$heading>

We may likne our fader Seynt Augustyn on-to +te holy patriark Iacob for
many causes . CMCAPSER-M4,145.6

On is for interpretacion of his name , CMCAPSER-M4,145.7

for Iacob is as mech to say as a supplanter or a deceyuour ,
CMCAPSER-M4,145.8

for he , at +te comaundment of God , supplanted his bro+tir , bying his
fader blessing for a mese of potage and aftirward apperyng to his fader
in Esaues cote . CMCAPSER-M4,145.9

So may our blessid fader Augustyn be cleped a supplanter of +te Deuel ,
CMCAPSER-M4,145.10

for whan +te same Deuel ha hold him in his seruyse xxx +gere , +tan ran
he fro +te Deuel CMCAPSER-M4,145.11

and took up-one him +te swete +gok of our Lord Ihesu Crist .
CMCAPSER-M4,145.12

For xxj +gere was he in paganite , and ix +gere in +te heresie of +te
Manychees . CMCAPSER-M4,145.13

He may be cleped Iacob also , CMCAPSER-M4,145.14

for euene as Iacob sey our Lord God fas to fas , so our maystir , with
secret contemplacion , was as ny God as ony erdely man myte be , as may
be wel perceyued be +te labour whech he had in inuestigacion of +te
godhed in +te bokes whech he mad of +te Trynyte . CMCAPSER-M4,145.15

This Iacob had xij sones , to whom all +te lond of byhest was distribute
and departed be Moyses & Iosue . CMCAPSER-M4,145.16

And +tis Augustin hath xij religious cumpanies , be whech xij all holy
cherch her in erde is replecchid . CMCAPSER-M4,145.17

We wil at +tis tyme on-to +gour deuoute eres open +tese Hebrew names of
+tese xij tribus , and referr hem to dyuers religions whech lyue vndir
Seynt Austyn reule . CMCAPSER-M4,145.18

The first be-goten child hite Iudas . CMCAPSER-M4,145.19

For Iudas is as mech to sey as a preyser , CMCAPSER-M4,145.20

and +tese men preise God nyte & day in holy songis & ympnis whech +tei
continuely be vsed too . CMCAPSER-M4,145.21

And +tis <P_146> Iudas eke may be referred on-to +too heremites +tat
Seynt Augustin mad ny iij +gere be-for +tat he was bischop at Ypone ,
and mad +tere chanones . CMCAPSER-M4,146.22

This mater is proued with grete euydens in +te book whech I mad to a
gentil woman in Englisch , and in +te book whech I mad to +te abbot of
Seynt Iames at Norhampton in Latin , whech boke I named Concordia ,
be-cause it is mad to reforme charite be-twix Seynt Augustines heremites
and his chanones . CMCAPSER-M4,146.23

In +tese same bokes may men se +te names of +te first faderes of +tis
order of heremites , whech heremites Simplician sent wit+g Augustin
on-to Affrik . CMCAPSER-M4,146.24

The second child of +tis Iacob , he hite Ruben , CMCAPSER-M4,146.25

and +tis Ruben is referred on-to chanones seculer swech as be in
cathedral cherchis . CMCAPSER-M4,146.26

For Ruben is as mech to sey as seing in +te myddis , or seing be +te
myddis . CMCAPSER-M4,146.27

What schal we calle bettir +te myddis +tan +tis present lif ?
CMCAPSER-M4,146.28

What was be-for +tis lif ordeyned for us is on-knowe .
CMCAPSER-M4,146.29

What we schal haue aftir +tis lif it is in doute , saue we hope veryly ,
be +te good menes of +tis myd lif , to come sumtyme to Goddis mercy .
CMCAPSER-M4,146.30

But men wil merueyle perauentur whi +tat I sette seculer chanones be-for
reguler , CMCAPSER-M4,146.31

and +tis $is my cause . CMCAPSER-M4,146.32

Thoo chanones +tat dwelled with Seynt Augustin whan he was bischop went
in clo+tis of dyuers colouris and in precious furres and with girdel &
barres of syluer and gilt , as is manifestly writyn in his sermones ,
CMCAPSER-M4,146.33

Ad fratres in heremo , CMCAPSER-M4,146.34

and +tis aray long not to reguler chanones . CMCAPSER-M4,146.35

The +tird son of Iacob he hite Gad , CMCAPSER-M4,146.36

and his name is as mech to sey as a man +tat is wel girt .
CMCAPSER-M4,146.37

Girdyng in holy scriptur is take for restreynyng of our body fro uices ,
CMCAPSER-M4,146.38

and +tis may be applied in +te best maner to chanones reguler , whech ,
with holy obseruaunces girdyn her bodies fro sinful werkis & here soules
fro foule desires . CMCAPSER-M4,146.39

If +tese men be-gunne with Augustin in his cherch in +te same degre as
+tei stand now , sum men haue doute ; CMCAPSER-M4,146.40

but I wyl not stryue . CMCAPSER-M4,146.41

I be-leue wel +tat +tere had +tei her beginnyng but +te harder
distinccion fro +te first ordr was mad sithe be o+tir holy faderes , as
+te munkis of Charturehous cam oute of +te blake ordr .
CMCAPSER-M4,146.42

Many euydens haue I mad in my book Concordia +tat <P_147> Seint Ruffus
not be-gan +tis ordr , but +tat he reformed +tis ordre .
CMCAPSER-M4,147.43

So may I wel be-leue +tat her first fundacion cam fro Augustin .
CMCAPSER-M4,147.44

The iiij son of Iacob , he hite Aser . CMCAPSER-M4,147.45

Aser is as mech to sei as blessed , CMCAPSER-M4,147.46

and +tis blessing is referred to +te grete noumbir of +tat holy
congregacion whech Seynt Dominice gadered and ordeyned , to +tis entent
, +tat +tei schuld labour in +te world and with here preching distroy
synne in +te puple and plant vertue . CMCAPSER-M4,147.47

This ordre be-gan Seyn Dominice +te +ger of oure Lord a_M_cc_xvj .
CMCAPSER-M4,147.48

The v. son of Iacob hite Neptalim , as mech for to sey as gret brede ;
CMCAPSER-M4,147.49

be +tis vndirstund we +te knytes of Seynt Ion whech begunne first at

Her institucion is to defende Cristen feith a-geyn Turkes and Sarsines .
CMCAPSER-M4,147.52

And all +too possessiones whech +tei haue in londis of pees pay tribute
to +te hous of Rodes . CMCAPSER-M4,147.53

The sext son hite Manasse , CMCAPSER-M4,147.54

entent to defense of +te bordures of cristen men a-geyn +te enmyes of
+te crosse . CMCAPSER-M4,147.56

Obliuious be +tei cleped be-cause +tei must for+gete +te delectable lyf
of +tis world and put her bodies in grete perel for +te honour of Crist
. CMCAPSER-M4,147.57

The differens of +te habite of +tese too knytes is +tis , +tat +tei of
Seynt Iones haue blak mantell with a crosse , and +tei of Pruce white
mantell with a crosse . CMCAPSER-M4,147.58
