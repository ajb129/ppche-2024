For als moche as the lond be+gonde the see +tat is to seye the holy lond
+tat men callen the lond of promyssioun or of beheste passynge all
o+tere londes it is the most worthi lond most excellent and lady &
souereyn of all o+tere londes & is blessed & halewed of the precyous
body & blood of oure lord jhesu crist ; jn the whiche land it lykede him
to take flesch & blood of the virgyne Marie to envyrone +tat holy lond
with his blessede feet ; CMMANDEV-M3,1.3

And +tere he wolde of his blessedness enoumbre him in the seyd blessed &
gloriouse virgine Marie & become man & worche many myracles and preche ,
and teche the feyth & the lawe of crystene men vnto his children .
CMMANDEV-M3,1.4

And +tere it lykede him to suffre many repreuynges and scornes for vs
CMMANDEV-M3,1.5

And he +tat was kyng of heuene of eyr of erthe of see & of all thinges
+tat ben contayned in hem wolde all only be cleped kyng of +tat lond
whan he seyde : REX XUM IUDERORUM : +tat is to seyne : I am kyng of
Jewes . CMMANDEV-M3,1.6

And +tat lond he chees before all o+t londes as the beste & most worthi
lond & the most vertuouse lond of all the world . CMMANDEV-M3,1.7

For it is the herte and the myddes of all the world , Wytnessynge the
philosophere +tat seyth thus : CMMANDEV-M3,1.8

the vertue of thinges is in the myddes . CMMANDEV-M3,1.9

And in +tat seyth thus : CMMANDEV-M3,1.10

VIRTUS RERUM IN MEDIO CONSISTIT that is to seye : the vertue of thinges
is in the myddes . CMMANDEV-M3,1.11

And in +tat lond he wolde lede his lyf & suffre passioun & deth of jewes
for Vs for to bye & to delyuere vs from peynes of helle And from deth
withouten ende , the whiche was ordeynd for vs for the synne of oure
formere fader Adam & for oure owne synnes also . CMMANDEV-M3,1.12

For as for himself he hadde non euyll deserued CMMANDEV-M3,1.13

for he thoughte neuere euyll CMMANDEV-M3,1.14

ne did euyll . CMMANDEV-M3,1.15

<P_2>

And he +tat was kyng of glorie & of ioye myghte best in that place
suffre deth because he ches in +tat lond rathere +tan in ony othere
+tere to suffre his passioun & his deth . CMMANDEV-M3,2.17

For he +tat wil pupplische ony thing to make it openly knowen he wil
make it to ben cryed & pronounced in the myddel place of a town so +tat
the thing +tat is proclamed & pronounced may euenly strecche to all
parties . CMMANDEV-M3,2.18

Right so he +tat was formyour of all the world wolde suffre for vs at
ierusalem +tat is the myddes of the world to +tat ende & entent +tat his
passioun & his deth +tat was pupplischt +tere myghte ben knowen euenly

See now how dere he boughte man +tat he made after his owne ymage & how
dere he a+genboght vs for the grete loue +tat he hadde to vs
CMMANDEV-M3,2.20

& we neuere deserued it to him . CMMANDEV-M3,2.21

For more precyous catell ne gretter raunsoun ne myghte he put for vs
+tan his blessede body his precious blood & his holy lyf +tat he
thralled for vs CMMANDEV-M3,2.22

& all he offred for vs +tat neuere did synne . CMMANDEV-M3,2.23

Dere god , what loue hadde he to vs his subiettes whan he +tat neuere
trespaced wolde for trespassours suffre deth ! CMMANDEV-M3,2.24

Right wel aughte vs for to loue & worscipe to drede & serue such a lord
and to worschipe & preyse such an holy lond +tat brought forth such
fruyt +torgh the whiche euery man is saued but it be his owne defaute .
CMMANDEV-M3,2.25

Wel may +tat lond be called delytable & a fructuouse lond +tat was
bebledd & moysted with the precyouse blode of oure lord jhesu crist ,
the whiche is the same lond +tat oure lord behighte vs in heritage .
CMMANDEV-M3,2.26

And in +tat lond he wolde dye as seised for to leve it to vs his
children . Wherfore euery gode cristene man +tat is of powere & hath
whereof scholde peynen him with all his strengthe for to conquere oure
right heritage & chacen out all the mysbeleeuynge men .
CMMANDEV-M3,2.27

For wee ben clept cristene men after crist oure fader CMMANDEV-M3,2.28

And +gif wee be right children of crist we oughte for to chalenge the
heritage +tat oure fader lafte vs & do it out of hethene mennes hondes .
CMMANDEV-M3,2.29

But now pryde couetyse & envye han so entflawmed the hertes of lordes of
the world +tat +tei are <P_3> more besy for to disherite here neyghbores
more +tan for to chalenge or to conquere here right heritage before seyd
. CMMANDEV-M3,3.30

And the comoun peple +tat wolde putte here bodyes & here catell for to
conquere oure heritage +tei may not don it withouten the lordes .
CMMANDEV-M3,3.31

For a semblee of peple withouten a cheuenteyn or a chief lord is a flok
of scheep withouten a schepperde the which departeth & desparpleth &
wyten neuer whider to go . CMMANDEV-M3,3.32

But wolde god +tat the temporel lordes & all worldly lordes were at gode
acord & with the comoun peple wolden taken this holy viage ouer the see
+tanne I trowe wel +tat within a lityl tyme oure right heritage before

For he smot so strongly & so harde him self in +tat roche +tat all his

CMMANDEV-M3,41.1018

And +tere besyde is the place where oure lord toke to Moyses the .x.

And +tere is the caue vnder the roche where Moyses duelte whan he fasted

But he dyede in the lond of promissioun , CMMANDEV-M3,41.1021

But noman knoweth where he was buryed . CMMANDEV-M3,41.1022

& ydoles is an ymage made of lewed will of man +tat man may not fynden

And for because +tat he was so wel with god +terfore +tei worschipe him

And so seyn +tei of the sonne be cause +tat he chaungeth <P_110> the

CMMANDEV-M3,110.2690

And +terfore maken +tei here god of an ox the on part & the o+ter
halfondell of a man be cause +tat man is the most noble creature in

CMMANDEV-M3,110.2691

+terfore make +tei the halfondel of ydole of a man vpwardes & the to+ter
half of an ox dounwardes . CMMANDEV-M3,110.2692

And of serpentes & of o+ter bestes & dyuerse +tinges +tat +tei

And also to suche folk it is an euyll meetynge of Ravenes .
CMMANDEV-M3,110.2700

In +teise things & in such <P_111> o+tere +ter ben many folk +tat

And so he passed ynde & the yles be+gonde ynde where ben mo +tan

And so longe he wente be see & lond & so enviround the world be many
seisons , +tat he fond an yle where he herde speke his owne langage ,
callynge on oxen in the plowgh suche wordes as men speken to bestes in
his owne contree , Where of he hadde gret meruayle , for he knew not how

But I seye +tat he had gon so longe be londe & be see , +tat he had
envyround all the erthe , +tat he was comen a+gen envirounynge +tat is

& +gif he wolde haue passed forth , he had founden his contre and his

But he turned a+gen from +tens fro whens he was come fro
CMMANDEV-M3,122.2979

& so he loste moche peynefull labour , as himself seyde a gret while
after +tat he was comen hom . CMMANDEV-M3,122.2980

For it befell after +tat he wente in to Norweye CMMANDEV-M3,122.2981

and +tere tempest of the see toke him CMMANDEV-M3,122.2982

and he arryued in an yle CMMANDEV-M3,122.2983

And whan he was in +tat yle he knew wel +tat it was the yle where he had
herd speke his owne langage before , & the callynge of oxen at the
plowgh , CMMANDEV-M3,122.2984

& +tat was possible +tinge . CMMANDEV-M3,122.2985

But how CMMANDEV-M3,122.2986

it semeth to symple men vnlerned +tat men ne mowe not go vnder the erthe

CMMANDEV-M3,122.2987

But +tat may not be vpon less <P_123> +tan wee mowe falle toward heuene

For fro what partie of the erthe +tat men duell ou+ter abouen or

And right as it semeth to vs +tat +tei ben vnder vs , right so it semeth

For +gif a man myghte falle fro the erthe vnto the firmament , be
grettere resoun the erthe & the see +tat ben so grete & so heuy scholde

And +terfore seith oure lord god : NON TIMEAS ME QUI SUSPENDI TERRAM EX

And all be it +tat it be possible +ting +tat men may so envyroune all

For , for the greatness of the erthe & of the see men may go be

perfitely toward the parties +tat he cam fro , but +gif it were be

For the erthe is full large & full gret CMMANDEV-M3,123.2996

And here seyenges I repreue nought , CMMANDEV-M3,123.2998

But after my lytyll wytt it semeth me , sauynge here reuerence , +tat is
more . CMMANDEV-M3,123.2999

And for to haue better vndirstondynge I seye +tus : Be +ter ymagyned a

& aboute the poynt of the gret compas +tat is clept the center be made
another litill compas . CMMANDEV-M3,123.3001

+Tan after be the gret compas devised be lynes in manye parties And +tat

grete compas schal be departed , in als manye schall be departed the
litill +tat is aboute the centre , all be it +tat the spaces ben lesse .
CMMANDEV-M3,123.3002

Now +tanne be the gret compas represented for the firmament And the

Now +tanne , the firmament is deuysed be Astronomeres in .xij. signes

Also be the erthe <P_124> deuysed in als many parties as the firmament

CMMANDEV-M3,124.3008

And wyteth it wel +tat after the Auctoures of Astronomye .DC. furlonges

So moche hath the erthe in roundness & of heghte enviroun after myn

And +gee schull vndirstonde +tat after the opynyoun of olde wise

But the grete CHANE hath euery day folk at his costages & expens as
