The fyrste is this <slash> that the same Ihu~s nyghed to mankynde .

The second is . that the same Ihu~s hath walkyd w=t= mankynde <slash>
Of whyche two pryncyples foloweth as a conclusyon the entent of his

Yet or I descende to the declaraco~n of thise two partyes <slash> for as

The fyrste saued the people by myght & power . The seconde by perfyte

He distoryed the aduersaryes of Cryste . CMFITZJA-M4,A3V.43

commaunded vnto Moyses : so Moyses co~maunded vnto Josue <$$paren>
CMFITZJA-M4,A4R.52

And he gladly accomplysshed all goddis preceptes CMFITZJA-M4,A4R.53

There escapyd hym not one worde of goddis preceptes <slash>

Of y=e= seconde namyd Ihu~s of laudable memory in the scrypture of god .

& one of the .lxx. Interpretours of the Bible <slash>

after the distrucco~n of Jhrlm . & subuersion of the temple of god in

To shewe you this . ye must vnderstonde <slash> that for the synnes of

Theyr cyte . theyr temple of grete honour was dystroyed .
CMFITZJA-M4,A4V.65

Sediche theyr laste kynge was exoculate & made blynde . brought wyth

And here was an ende of kynges in the genelogy of Crist as by the
processe of the Byble playnly dooth appere . CMFITZJA-M4,A4V.67

For soth it is y=t= after the tyme of this transmigraco~n vnto Cristis
natiuyte . where regalyte & preesthode <P_A5R> were Joyned in one in

had neuer_moo kynges <slash> but oonly prestes & dukes . bysshops &

And thenne began the lyne of bysshops in rulynge of the people . whiche

CMFITZJA-M4,A5R.70

This declaryth the Mayster of the storyes who so lyste to se it .

Now the fyrste of thyse greate preestis or Bysshops hauynge rule of the

obedience vnto almyghty god . & teche other the same CMFITZJA-M4,A5R.72

For whan it pleysid our lorde to haue his people releuyd from theyr

The other . that is Ihu~s Josedech preparyd the people by due obedyence

Dissolue ye this temple . & wythin thre dayes I shall reyse it agayn .

Thyse wordes sayd our sauyour Ihu~ Cryst of the temple of his holy body

prophecy of Agge . in the seconde chapytre . CMFITZJA-M4,A5V.78

Ferre gretter sayth this prophete . shall be the glory of this seconde
temple . than was {the_glory} of the fyrste buylded by Salomon <slash>
CMFITZJA-M4,A5V.79

Spyrytually I saye For the letter full harde it is . to expowne of this

this second temple was neuer half so gloryous as was that fyrste buylyed
by Salomon . ne in buyldyng ne yet in aparell as Josephus declareth
<slash> CMFITZJA-M4,A5V.80

For in y=e= fyrst temple was conteyned the arke of the olde testament .
