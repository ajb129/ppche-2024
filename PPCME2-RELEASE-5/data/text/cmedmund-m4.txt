and that was special grace of oure Lorde . CMEDMUND-M4,165.68

And on a daye he came to an ymage of oure Lady CMEDMUND-M4,165.69

And after that she levyd a clene virgyn to hir lyves ende .
CMEDMUND-M4,166.86

Than sone after Mabely his swete moder nyghed hir ende

And theye ben buryed before the high auter in the same nonry .
CMEDMUND-M4,166.99

And than this holy man Seynt Edmond dwellyd at Oxford
CMEDMUND-M4,166.100

and contynued there in ful holy leuyng CMEDMUND-M4,166.101

for he weryd the hard heyre knett with knottes lyke a nett .
CMEDMUND-M4,166.102

And the knottis stekyd faste to his flessh that oftyntymes it causid his
body to blede and to be full sore . CMEDMUND-M4,166.103

And in this maner was bothe hys shurte and hys breche imade ,
CMEDMUND-M4,166.104

and he bounde it faste with a corde to hys body that the heyre myght
cleve fast to his body in euery place . CMEDMUND-M4,166.105

Hyt sate so strayte vpon hym that vnnethe he myght bowe his body , the
which was a ful grete penaunce to hym . CMEDMUND-M4,166.106

And in a tyme whan his shurte of heyre was fowle and tobroke , he toke
it his man too brenne in a grete fyre . CMEDMUND-M4,166.107

But he cowde not brenne hem in no wyse , CMEDMUND-M4,166.108

but euer thaye laye hole and vnbrent in the fyre . CMEDMUND-M4,166.109

Than his mann toke an hevy stone CMEDMUND-M4,166.110

and bownde the shurte thereto CMEDMUND-M4,166.111

and caste it in the water where was a depe ponde ; CMEDMUND-M4,166.112

and there he left theym . CMEDMUND-M4,166.113

But he tolde hys maister that thaye were brente . CMEDMUND-M4,166.114

<P_167>

Seynt Edmond and his felowys on a daye came fro Lewkenowre to Abyngdon
CMEDMUND-M4,167.116

and as thaye came into a grete valey thaye se many black fowlys lyke
crowys , among which there sate one that was all totoryn with the other
black crowys ; CMEDMUND-M4,167.117

and thaye cast hym from one to another that it was grete pety to beholde
it . CMEDMUND-M4,167.118

Therefore his felowys were nye madde for fere of that syght .
CMEDMUND-M4,167.119

And then Seynt Edmond comfortyd hem CMEDMUND-M4,167.120

and tolde theym whate it was . CMEDMUND-M4,167.121

He saide that thaye beth feendis of helle that berith a mannys sowle
that dyed at the towne of Chalfegrove right nowe , CMEDMUND-M4,167.122

and that sowle shall neuer come in the blysse of heuyn for his cursyd
leuyng . CMEDMUND-M4,167.123

And than Seynt Edmond and his felowis wente to the towne of Chalfegrove
CMEDMUND-M4,167.124

and fownde al thyng lyke as Seynt Edmond tolde theym .
CMEDMUND-M4,167.125

And fro thens thaye wente too Abyngdon CMEDMUND-M4,167.126

and theire Seynt Edmond wente into the churche CMEDMUND-M4,167.127

and sayde his prayers lyke as he was wonte to doo , the which prayer was
O intemerata , the which he sayde euery daye in the wurship of Jesu
Criste , oure blessyd Lady , and of Seynt John the Euaungelyst .
CMEDMUND-M4,167.128

And this prayer he vsyd to saye dayly or he dyd one wordely workys .
CMEDMUND-M4,167.129

But in a tyme he forgate to saye this holy oryson CMEDMUND-M4,167.130

and than Seynt John the Euaungelyst came to Seynt Edmond in a ful
gastfull maner CMEDMUND-M4,167.131

and blamyd gretely Seynt Edmond . CMEDMUND-M4,167.132

But after that to his lyfys ende he neuer forgate to saye that holy
prayer . CMEDMUND-M4,167.133

And after this holy man encresyd so gretely in Oxforde in all the vii
sciences that all men had grete joye of hym . CMEDMUND-M4,167.134

And in a nyght as he sate in his studye , hys awne moder Maboly appierid
vnto hym in a vysyon . CMEDMUND-M4,167.135

And she sayde to hir sonne : ' Loke fro hense forewarde that thue
laboure in devynyte and in no nother science , CMEDMUND-M4,167.136

for that is the wylle of God lyke as he hathe sente the worde by me . '
CMEDMUND-M4,167.137

This saide she vanyshed awaye fro hym . CMEDMUND-M4,167.138

And after that this holy mann labourid <P_168> alweye in devynyte to
fulfylle the wylle of oure Lorde Jesu Cryst . CMEDMUND-M4,168.139

And he encresyd so mervelously in that scyence that al Oxford had grete
wondyr of hym for his grete connyng , CMEDMUND-M4,168.140

for there was none lyke hym in all Oxford . CMEDMUND-M4,168.141

ffor he had that grace when he radde in the scole of devynyte , he
profyted more to the herers in one weke than other mennys techyng dyd in
a moneth , CMEDMUND-M4,168.142

for many one of his scolers thurgh his gracious techyng forsoke the
worlde CMEDMUND-M4,168.143

and became relygious men . CMEDMUND-M4,168.144

And in a daye as the holy man sate in the scole for to dispute of the
holy trynyte , he came long ar his scolers came , CMEDMUND-M4,168.145

and he felle in a sclombryng as he sate on his chayre .
CMEDMUND-M4,168.146

And ther came a white dove CMEDMUND-M4,168.147

and brought hym the body of oure Lorde CMEDMUND-M4,168.148

and he put hyt into his mouthe . CMEDMUND-M4,168.149

And than the dove flye vpwarde from hym CMEDMUND-M4,168.150

and heuyn openyd ayenst hym as Seynt Edmonde behelde hit .
CMEDMUND-M4,168.151

And euer after he thought that the savoure of oure Lordis flessh was
euer in hys mowthe . CMEDMUND-M4,168.152

And thereby he knewe full moche privyte of the pure state of Jesu Cryste
and of hys magestye in hevyn , CMEDMUND-M4,168.153

for he had mervelouse connyng aboue al other doctors that were in
Oxforde CMEDMUND-M4,168.154

for he expownyd so hye maters to theym that they thought he was more
lyke an angel than a man . CMEDMUND-M4,168.155

And in euery lesson that this holy man taught he thought in oure Lordis
passhyon . CMEDMUND-M4,168.156

And in a nyght he studyed so long on his bokys that sodenly he fylle
aslepe and forgate to blesse hym and thynke on the passhyon of oure
Lorde . CMEDMUND-M4,168.157

And than the feende that had gret envy to hym laye so hevye on Seynt
Edmond that he had no power to blesse hym with the ryght honde ner with
the lyft honde . CMEDMUND-M4,168.158

And than Seynt Edmond wyst not whate to doo , CMEDMUND-M4,168.159

but at last thurgh the grace of oure Lorde he remembryd his blessyd
passhyon ; CMEDMUND-M4,168.160

and then the feend had no power ouer Seynt Edmond , CMEDMUND-M4,168.161

but fylle downe anone fro hym . CMEDMUND-M4,168.162

And than Seynt Edmond commaundid hym by the vertue of oure Lordis
passhion that he shulde telle hym howe he shulde best defende hym that
he shulde haue no power ouer hym . CMEDMUND-M4,168.163

And the feende aunsweryd to Seynt Edmond : ' That that thue haste sayde
and thought on the passhyon of oure Lorde Jesu Cryst ;
CMEDMUND-M4,168.164

ffor whate mann or womann that hath hys mende on oure Lordis passhyon ,
I have no power ouer theym at no tyme . ' CMEDMUND-M4,168.165

And euer after Seynt Edmond the holy mann had ful grete deuocyoun in the
passhyon of oure Lorde and in holy orysons CMEDMUND-M4,168.166

for therein was all hys delyte bothe nyght and daye .
CMEDMUND-M4,168.167

But when he ete , slepte and rode , all that tyme he thought was but in
ydelnes and hevy onto hym . CMEDMUND-M4,168.168

But all <P_169> that he labourid in holy studye or bedis-byddyng or
almesdede-doyng , all suche thynges was moost plesaunce to hym ,
CMEDMUND-M4,169.169

and he was neuer wery of suche werkys CMEDMUND-M4,169.170

for he was all hole yeuyn to Goddys seruyce and to hys plesyng .
CMEDMUND-M4,169.171

And also he was a notable prechoure CMEDMUND-M4,169.172

and gretely his techyng edefyed in the people that all people had grete
devosyon to hyre his prechyng . CMEDMUND-M4,169.173

In that tyme the pope sente his crosser to the bysshoppis of Ynglonde
that thaye shulde chese a wyse clerke that shulde proclayme the popys
entent thurgh this realme of Ynglond for to haue helpe and socoure
ayenste the Turke , Goddes enmy . CMEDMUND-M4,169.174

And so by one assent theye chose Seynt Edmond to proclayme the popys
wylle . CMEDMUND-M4,169.175

And soo he dyd that charge full welle and dyligently thurgh this londe ,
CMEDMUND-M4,169.176

and moche people he causyd to take the crosse and for to go into the
Holy Londe . CMEDMUND-M4,169.177

And as a yong mann came with other to resseyue the crosse , a woman that
louyd hym lette hym of hys purpose CMEDMUND-M4,169.178

and she drewe hym fast awaye fro thens with hir hondys .
CMEDMUND-M4,169.179

And anone bothe hir hondis were styffe and harde as a borde
CMEDMUND-M4,169.180

and also hir hondis wax all crokyd . CMEDMUND-M4,169.181

And than she made grete sorowe CMEDMUND-M4,169.182

and cryed God mercye ; CMEDMUND-M4,169.183

and she prayed Seynt Edmond to praye for hir to oure Lorde .
CMEDMUND-M4,169.184

And he sayde to hir : ' Woman , wylt thue take the crosse ? '
CMEDMUND-M4,169.185

And she sayde : ' Yee , sir , full fayne . ' CMEDMUND-M4,169.186

And than she resseyuid it CMEDMUND-M4,169.187

and was made hole . CMEDMUND-M4,169.188

And than she thankyd oure Lorde , Jesu Cryste , and his holy seruaunt ,
Seynt Edmond . CMEDMUND-M4,169.189

And thurgh this grete myracle moche more people toke the crosse .
CMEDMUND-M4,169.190

In a tyme as this holy man prechyd at Oxforde in the churcheyerthe of
Alhalwyn and moche people was there to hyre his holy prechyng . Sodenly
there waxed so derke weder that alle the people were sore agast ;
CMEDMUND-M4,169.191

and moche people beganne to go awaye , the wynde and the weder was so
horryble . CMEDMUND-M4,169.192

And than this holy man sayde to the people : ' Abyde ye stylle here
CMEDMUND-M4,169.193

ffor the power of God is strenger than the feendis power ,
CMEDMUND-M4,169.194

for thus he doyth for envye to distrouble Goddes worde . '
CMEDMUND-M4,169.195

And than Seynte Edmond lyfte vppe his mynde to oure Lorde
CMEDMUND-M4,169.196

and besought of mercy and grace . CMEDMUND-M4,169.197

And when he had endid his oryson , the weder beganne to withdrawe bye
the other syde of the churche . CMEDMUND-M4,169.198

And all the people that abode there stylle to hyre the prechyng had not
one drope <P_170> of rayne . CMEDMUND-M4,170.199

But thaye that wente awaye fro the sermon were thurghwette with the
rayne , CMEDMUND-M4,170.200

and there fylle so moche rayne in the hye strete that men myght neither
go ner ride therein . CMEDMUND-M4,170.201

And than alle the people preysid God in his seruaunt for this grete
myracle . CMEDMUND-M4,170.202

And at Wynchester another tyme , when he prechyd , was shewid there a
lyke myracle CMEDMUND-M4,170.203

for there he chasyd awaye suche a derke wether by hys holy prayer .
CMEDMUND-M4,170.204

Than for his holy levyng he was chose hye chanon at Salysbury
CMEDMUND-M4,170.205

and there he was made rewler and tresourer . CMEDMUND-M4,170.206

And there he levyd a full gode lyve , CMEDMUND-M4,170.207

for all the mony that he myght gete he yeaff hyt in almes to pore folkys

CMEDMUND-M4,170.208

And than he wente to th@ @abbey of Stanley CMEDMUND-M4,170.209

and soiournyd there tylle hys rentys came in , CMEDMUND-M4,170.210

ffor Maister Stephyn Lexston that there was abbott was somtyme his
scoler in Oxford . CMEDMUND-M4,170.211

He was so lytle an etyr that menn woundryd howe he levyd .
CMEDMUND-M4,170.212

And yett he wolde ete no costelewe mete CMEDMUND-M4,170.213

for full selde he ete any flessh . CMEDMUND-M4,170.214

And fro Shroftyde tyll Ester he wolde ete no mete that suffryd the dethe
, CMEDMUND-M4,170.215

not in Aduent he ete neuer but Lente-mete . CMEDMUND-M4,170.216

And when the Archiebisshopp of Canterbury was dede , he was chose by all

And anone thaye sent there messyngers to hym to Salysbury ,

CMEDMUND-M4,170.219

There he was prevyly in hys chambir allone in his prayers ;

and one of his chapeleyns came into his chambyr CMEDMUND-M4,170.221

and tolde hym that he was chose Archiebysshopp of Canterbury and that
