" For as moche thanne as thow hast seyn whiche is the fourme of good

And in this thing I trowe that we schulde first enquere for to witen ,

For alle thing that is cleped inparfyt is proevid inparfit be the

And herof cometh it that in every thing general , yif that men seen any

For yif so be that perfeccioun is don awey , men may nat thinke ne say

in whom this blisfulnesse enhabiteth . CMBOETH-M3,432.C1.113

The comune accordaunce and conceyt of the corages of men proveth and

For alwey , of alle thinges , the nature of hem ne may nat ben betere

For ther n@ @is nothing so late , in so schorte bowndes of this lif ,

Thanne ryght swich comparysoun as is of skillynge to undirstondyng , and

But in this manere the domes of men discorden , that thilke men that som

CMBOETH-M3,452.C2.457

But lat us graunten , I pose , that som man may wel demen or knowen the
good folk and the badde ; CMBOETH-M3,452.C2.458

may he thanne knowen and seen thilke innereste atempraunce of corages as

Ne it ne is nat an unlike miracle to hem that ne knowen it nat <paren>

also why that some syk folk ben holpen with lyghte medicynes , and some

But natheles the leche , that knoweth the manere and the atempraunce of

CMBOETH-M3,452.C2.463

But what othir thing semeth hele of corages but <P_453.C1> bounte and

And what othir thing semeth maladye of corages but vices ?

Who is elles kepere of good or dryvere awey of yvel but God , governour

CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.466

Lo , herof comyth and herof is don this noble miracle of the ordre

" But for to constreyne <paren> <font> as who seith , but for to

Thanne whatsoevere thou mayst seen that is doon in this world unhopid or

CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.471

but as to thi wikkid opynioun it is a confusioun .
CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.472

But I suppose that som man be so wel ithewed that the devyne jugement
and the jugement of mankynde accorden hem togidre of hym ;
CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.473

but he is so unstidfast of corage that , yif any adversite come to hym ,
he wol forleten peraventure to continue innocence by the whiche he ne
may nat withholden fortune . CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.474

Thanne the wise dispensacion of God sparith hym , the whiche man
adversite myghte enpeyren ; for that God wol nat suffren hym to travaile
to whom that travaile n@ @is nat covenable . CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.475

Anothir man is parfit in alle vertus , CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.476

and is an holi man and neigh to God , so that the purveaunce of God
wolde deme that it were a felonie that he were touched with any
adversites ; so that he wol nat suffre that swich a man be moeved with
any bodily maladye . CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.477

But so as seyde a philosophre , the more excellent by me - he seyde in
Grec that ' vertues han edified the body of the holi man . '

" And ofte tyme it betydeth that the somme of thingis that ben to done
is taken to governe to good folk , for that the malice haboundaunt of
schrewes scholde ben abated . CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.480

And God yeveth and departeth to other folk prosperites and adversites
imedled to-hepe aftir the qualite of hir corages , CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.481

and remordith some folk by adversite , CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.482

for thei ne scholden nat waxen proude by long welefulnesse ;
CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.483

and other folk he suffreth to ben travailed with harde thinges for that
thei scholden confermen the vertues of corage by the usage and the
exercitacioun of pacience . CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.484

And other folk dreden more than thei oughten the whiche thei myghte wel

and thilke folk God ledeth into experience of hemself by aspre and
sorweful thingis . CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.486

And many other folk han bought honourable renoun of this world by the
prys of glorious deth ; CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.487

and som men , that ne mowen nat ben overcomen by torment , han yeven
ensample to other folk that vertu mai nat ben overcomyn by adversites .
CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.488

And of alle thise thinges ther n@ @is no doute that thei ne ben doon
ryghtfully and ordeynly , to the profit of hem to whom we seen thise
thingis betyde . CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.489

" For certes , that adversite cometh somtyme to schrewes and somtyme
that that they desiren , it comith of thise forseyde causes .
CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.490

And of sorweful thinges that betyden to schrewes , certes , no man ne
wondreth ; CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.491

for alle men wenen that thei han wel desservid it , and that thei ben of
wykkid meryt . Of whiche schrewes the torment somtyme agasteth othere
to don felonyes , and somtyme it amendeth hem that suffren the tormentz
; CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.492

and the prosperite that is yeven to schrewes scheweth a gret argument to
good folk what thing thei scholde demen of thilke welefulnesse , the
whiche prosperite men seen ofte serven to schrewes . In the whiche
thing I trowe that God dispenseth . CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.493

For peraventure the nature of som man is so overthrowynge to yvel , and
so uncovenable , that the nedy poverte of his houshold myghte rather
egren hym to don felonyes ; CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.494

and to the maladye of hym God putteth remedye to yeven hym <P_454.C1>

joyeful to hym , that the lesynge of thilke blisfulnesse ne be nat
sorwful to hym ; CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.498

and therfore he wol chaunge his maneris , CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.499

and , for he dredith to lesen his fortune , he forletith his wikkidnesse
. CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.500

To other folke is welefulnesse iyeven unworthely , the whiche
overthroweth hem into destruccioun , that thei han disservid ;
CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.501

and to som othir folk is yeven power to punysshen , for that it schal be
cause of contynuacioun and exercisynge to good folk , and cause of

For so as ther n@ @is noon alliaunce bytwixe good folk and schrewes , ne
schrewes ne mowen nat acorden among hemself . CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.503

And whi nat ? CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.504

For schrewes discorden of hemself by hir vices , the whiche vices al
toreenden her consciences , and doon ofte time thinges the whiche
thingis , whan thei han doon hem , they demen that tho thinges ne

purveaunce hath makid ofte tyme fair myracle , so that schrewes han

For whan that some schrewes seen that they suffren wrongfully felonyes
of othere schrewes , they wexen eschaufed into hate of hem that anoyed

and retornen to the fruyt of vertu , whan thei studien to ben unlyke to

Certis oonly this is the devyne myght to the whiche myghte yvelis ben
