Scene I . MORTON-1813-2,1.6

- <font> A Hall in Templeton's House . MORTON-1813-2,1.7

returns , followed by <$$font> Damper . MORTON-1813-2,1.10

<$$heading>

Damper . Is Mr. Templeton within ? MORTON-1813-2,1.12

<font> Serv. <$$font> The favour of your name , Sir ?
MORTON-1813-2,1.13

<paren> Damper <font> gives a card <$$paren> <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,1.14

Mr. Damper - he is not , Sir ? MORTON-1813-2,1.15

<font> Damp. <$$font> Pugh , pugh ! I@ @'m his intimate friend .
MORTON-1813-2,1.16

<font> Serv. <$$font> Oh no , Sir - there you@ @'ll pardon me -
MORTON-1813-2,1.17

I keep a most accurate list of my master and mistress@ @'s friends
<font> <paren> shewing a Book <$$paren> <$$font> . MORTON-1813-2,1.18

<font> Damp. <$$font> Indeed ! a convenient sort of reference ;
MORTON-1813-2,1.19

for to know friends , as times go , is no very easy matter .
MORTON-1813-2,1.20

Hark you , fellow ; MORTON-1813-2,1.21

tell your master that Mr. Damper from Lombard-street - a stranger to
his present fashionable nomenclature , but one who formerly was in his
books - insists on seeing him instantly . MORTON-1813-2,1.22

<font> Serv. <$$font> Sir , I shall give in your ticket ;
MORTON-1813-2,1.23

but making speeches is not in my department . MORTON-1813-2,1.24

<font> Damp. <$$font> Indeed ! then I presume you {TEXT:your} are what
is called a figure footman , and hired by measure - MORTON-1813-2,1.25

<font> <paren> Servant bows <$$paren> . <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,1.26

Six feet of more accomplished assurance I never looked up to .
MORTON-1813-2,1.27

<font> Serv. <$$font> You are pleased to flatter . MORTON-1813-2,1.28

<font> Damp. <$$font> But if the distance across your shoulders was not
included in the estimate - here is a measure <P_2> <font> <paren>
shewing a cane <$$paren> <$$font> that will in one moment ascertain it ,
unless you exactly obey my orders . MORTON-1813-2,2.29

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> Servant . <$$bracket> MORTON-1813-2,2.30

Bad memories indeed - when friends can@ @not be remembered without book
. MORTON-1813-2,2.31

- When in London and in active life he was above these modern fopperies
; MORTON-1813-2,2.32

but a young gay wife sadly alters your middle_aged gentleman .
MORTON-1813-2,2.33

<font> Enter <$$font> Mr. Templeton <font> and <$$font> Servant .
MORTON-1813-2,2.34

Templeton ! heartily glad to see you . MORTON-1813-2,2.35

<font> Temp. <$$font> What , my old partner Damper !
MORTON-1813-2,2.36

- welcome to Leicestershire - thrice welcome , my worthiest friend !
MORTON-1813-2,2.37

<font> Damp. <paren> To Serv. <$$paren> <$$font> Do you hear ?
MORTON-1813-2,2.38

his worthiest friend ! MORTON-1813-2,2.39

- Book me - MORTON-1813-2,2.40

<bracket> <font> Exit Serv. <$$font> <$$bracket> . MORTON-1813-2,2.41

You look tolerably hearty and cheerful - MORTON-1813-2,2.42

but - MORTON-1813-2,2.43

<font> Temp . <$$font> But ! MORTON-1813-2,2.44

- Oh , old Damper still , I see - MORTON-1813-2,2.45

When will you leave your vile buts , and doubts , and perhaps's .
MORTON-1813-2,2.46

<font> Damp. <$$font> When my friend's conduct no longer requires them
- MORTON-1813-2,2.47

perhaps yours do@ @n't : MORTON-1813-2,2.48

- but - you are married again , I hear ? MORTON-1813-2,2.49

<font> Temp. <$$font> To a woman I adore . MORTON-1813-2,2.50

<font> Damp. <$$font> Poor fellow - when the diseases of children
attack maturity , they always rage with redoubled violence .
MORTON-1813-2,2.51

<font> Temp. <$$font> Marriage , believe me , is the end of life .
MORTON-1813-2,2.52

<font> Damp. <$$font> I believe it would be the end of mine .
MORTON-1813-2,2.53

So you adore the charms of this Venus , eh ? MORTON-1813-2,2.54

<font> Temp. <$$font> I do indeed . MORTON-1813-2,2.55

<font> Damp. <$$font> Perhaps she adores you for the same cause , eh ,
my Adonis of half a century ! - ha ! ha ! MORTON-1813-2,2.56

<font> Temp. <$$font> No , no - yet gratitude for my affection - my
attention to her happiness - the affluence I placed her in -
MORTON-1813-2,2.57

<font> Damp. <$$font> True ; MORTON-1813-2,2.58

when fifty and twenty match , 't@ @is a sort of give-and-take race ,
MORTON-1813-2,2.59

and you are expected to carry weight for age . MORTON-1813-2,2.60

So my old friend is as happy as I could wish him ? MORTON-1813-2,2.61

<P_3>

<font> Temp. <$$font> Yes , exceedingly - very - reasonably happy -
tolerably happy - certainly - but - MORTON-1813-2,3.63

<font> Damp. <paren> aside <$$paren> <$$font> So I have brought <font>
him <$$font> to his <font> buts . <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,3.64

<font> Temp. <$$font> Perfection , you know , my dear Damper , is -
<font> Damp. <$$font> Fortunately not necessary to human happiness .
MORTON-1813-2,3.65

<font> Temp. <$$font> Certainly not ; but - MORTON-1813-2,3.66

<font> Damp. <paren> aside <$$paren> <$$font> Zounds , again -
MORTON-1813-2,3.67

Come , out with the worst . MORTON-1813-2,3.68

<font> Temp. <$$font> Then the worst is , that Mrs. Templeton has had
a perverted modern education : MORTON-1813-2,3.69

- for in our stylish manufactories of female attainments , the Muses and
Graces so struggle for precedency , that the unassuming domestic virtues
are completely jostled into a corner ; MORTON-1813-2,3.70

- and from this <font> magazin a_la_mode <$$font> issues an abundant
supply of female poets , artists , attitudinarians , philosophizing
daughters , waltzing wives , and infidel mothers . MORTON-1813-2,3.71

<font> Damp. <$$font> The effects on Mrs. Templeton - <font> Temp.
<$$font> Are an active taste for expense , with a decided averseness
from all household duties , produced by the indolent and deceptive
spirit of procrastination ; which , pregnant with the productions of
to-morrow , leaves to-day barren and comfortless ; MORTON-1813-2,3.72

and while we abound in economical theories , we are ruined by unthrifty
practice : - so that in Mrs. Templeton's boudoir {TEXT:boidoir} you may
see the Lady's best Companion entombed in the dust it aims to sweep away
; while a satirical spider has drawn his web over the Complete Housewife
. MORTON-1813-2,3.73

- And thus to-morrow , to-morrow , and to-morrow - MORTON-1813-2,3.74

<font> Damp. <$$font> Come , come . MORTON-1813-2,3.75

- Considering the bad culture of the soil , the produce might have been
worse . MORTON-1813-2,3.76

<font> Temp. <$$font> Very true , indeed : - but - MORTON-1813-2,3.77

<font> Damp. <$$font> Zounds , again ! - <font> <paren> aside .
<$$paren> <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,3.78

<font> Temp. <$$font> You must know I was captivated with <P_4> her
eyes - brilliant , fascinating , penetrating - and - and -
MORTON-1813-2,4.79

<font> Damp. <$$font> I@ @'ll finish the sentence - MORTON-1813-2,4.80

their brilliancy blinded you to her imperfections , while their keenness
enabled her to discover yours . MORTON-1813-2,4.81

<font> Temp. <$$font> Rather so - yes . MORTON-1813-2,4.82

- And , between ourselves , a priest of the sun is not required to offer
more frequent incense to his idol , than I am to their effulgence .
MORTON-1813-2,4.83

She@ @'s here . MORTON-1813-2,4.84

<font> Damp. <$$font> A fine woman , faith . MORTON-1813-2,4.85

- I@ @'m afraid of these dazzling eyes - MORTON-1813-2,4.86

a <font> coup_de_soleil <$$font> might be fatal . MORTON-1813-2,4.87

- I had better go . MORTON-1813-2,4.88

<font> Temp. <$$font> Go , my friend ! MORTON-1813-2,4.89

<font> Damp. <$$font> I ca@ @n't administer to vanity , not I ;
MORTON-1813-2,4.90

- besides , I@ @'m in <font> deshabille . <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,4.91

- Oh ! here@ @'s a glass to adjust my wig and cravat by <font> <paren>
goes to a glass <$$paren> . <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,4.92

Personal vanity I abominate , friend Templeton , MORTON-1813-2,4.93

and few are to be found without it - <font> <paren> adjusting his figure
in the glass <$$paren> . <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,4.94

<font> Temp. <$$font> Very few , indeed . MORTON-1813-2,4.95

<font> <paren> Mrs. Templeton without <$$paren> <$$font> - Pray , do@
@n't tease {TEXT:teaze} me now ; MORTON-1813-2,4.96

tell them all to be sure and come tomorrow . MORTON-1813-2,4.97

- <font> <paren> Enters <$$paren> . <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,4.98

My dear Mr. Templeton , you@ @'ll be delighted with the guest your son
Vincent has introduced . MORTON-1813-2,4.99

<font> Temp. <$$font> You mean Mr. Aspic . MORTON-1813-2,4.100

<font> Mrs. Temp. <$$font> Such commanding talents , such superior
taste - MORTON-1813-2,4.101

he has found fault with every thing he has seen ; MORTON-1813-2,4.102

and has pronounced the house and grounds so detestable , that I ca@ @n't
endure the sight of them : MORTON-1813-2,4.103

- how obliging it is of him ! MORTON-1813-2,4.104

<font> Temp. <$$font> Extremely . MORTON-1813-2,4.105

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> We@ @'ve laid such delightful plans :
MORTON-1813-2,4.106

- the house is to come down , the farm to be parked , and the meadows to
be put under water . MORTON-1813-2,4.107

- Now , my love , you@ @'ll have no trouble - <font> Temp. <$$font>
Except the slight trouble of paying for it . MORTON-1813-2,4.108

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> Oh , but Mr. Aspic says people of <P_5> taste
never think about that : MORTON-1813-2,5.109

so I shall give order to begin . MORTON-1813-2,5.110

<font> Temp. <$$font> When , my dear ? MORTON-1813-2,5.111

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> Oh , to-morrow . MORTON-1813-2,5.112

<font> Temp. <$$font> Then all@ @'s safe <font> <paren> aside <$$paren>
. <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,5.113

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> Who is that odd man ? MORTON-1813-2,5.114

<font> Temp. <$$font> My late partner , who , contented with competence
, retired - MORTON-1813-2,5.115

<font> <paren> Damper advances <$$paren> . <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,5.116

My love , I am happy to afford you the gratification of making welcome
my friend Mr. Damper . MORTON-1813-2,5.117

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> The possessor of that title must be
interesting in my <font> eyes . <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,5.118

<font> Damp. <$$font> Eyes already ! <font> <paren> aside . <$$paren>
<$$font> MORTON-1813-2,5.119

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> To see a friend of Mr. Templeton's is highly
gratifying . MORTON-1813-2,5.120

<font> Temp. <paren> to Damper <$$paren> <$$font> Do you mark the
emphasis ? MORTON-1813-2,5.121

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> But in glancing over our list I have not
observed your name : MORTON-1813-2,5.122

but my tall man is shockingly inaccurate . MORTON-1813-2,5.123

Do you know last winter , Sir , he told me I was quite intimate with
Lady Paramount - MORTON-1813-2,5.124

but in making her a visit , the old Goth denied the least knowledge of
me . MORTON-1813-2,5.125

I wish some of the Society of Arts@ @' people would offer a premium for
the best system of visiting one's friends . MORTON-1813-2,5.126

- Could not you book-keeping gentlemen deserve well of your country by
some plan ? MORTON-1813-2,5.127

- <font> Damp. <$$font> Why really I do@ @n't see why the merchandise
of fashionable arrangements should be without its ledger , though it
might be difficult to post some things to the credit of the account .
MORTON-1813-2,5.128

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> Ha , ha ! MORTON-1813-2,5.129

<font> Damp. <$$font> Then as your time is so precious , what think you
, madam , of a subscription for a west-end of the town clearing house ,
where these worsted lace representatives of our nobility might assemble
for the exchange of accepted calls , dishonoured invitations , and the
quick transfer of the paper currency of polite accommodation
MORTON-1813-2,5.130

<P_6>

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> Delightful ! MORTON-1813-2,6.132

- the tunnels and auction marts in real utility would be nothing to it .
MORTON-1813-2,6.133

I@ @'ll positively write to town about it to-morrow .
MORTON-1813-2,6.134

- Oh , there@ @'s Mr. Aspic ! MORTON-1813-2,6.135

<font> Damp. <$$font> Who ? MORTON-1813-2,6.136

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> Mr. Aspic ! MORTON-1813-2,6.137

- If you do@ @n't know him , I@ @'ll make you acquainted .
MORTON-1813-2,6.138

<font> Damp. <$$font> I will not be acquainted , madam , because I do
know him . MORTON-1813-2,6.139

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> Are you aware that he writes in the Tenterhook
Review , is a caricaturist , and the author of the severest satirical
novels ? MORTON-1813-2,6.140

- 'T@ @is highly dangerous not to be well with him .
MORTON-1813-2,6.141

<font> Damp. <$$font> A pleasant recommendation , truly .
MORTON-1813-2,6.142

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> Well , I must away - MORTON-1813-2,6.143

I@ @'ve a_thousand things to arrange for to-morrow .
MORTON-1813-2,6.144

I hope I may look forward , Sir , to a long visit ? MORTON-1813-2,6.145

<font> Damp. <$$font> I shall not have the temerity to promise that -
MORTON-1813-2,6.146

you may not like me a little , MORTON-1813-2,6.147

and I may like you too much . MORTON-1813-2,6.148

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> Oh , I shall wink at that .
MORTON-1813-2,6.149

<font> Damp. <$$font> Closing those eyes is certainly the best way to
secure my safety . MORTON-1813-2,6.150

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> Pshaw ! Templeton can tell you how I hate all
that . MORTON-1813-2,6.151

<font> Damp. <$$font> He has . MORTON-1813-2,6.152

<font> Mrs. T. <$$font> I@ @'m too clear-sighted to be deceived by
such flattery , I assure you . MORTON-1813-2,6.153

- Adieu ! MORTON-1813-2,6.154

<font> <paren> Exit . <$$paren> <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,6.155

<font> Damp. <$$font> Rid your house of that fellow - that Aspic .
MORTON-1813-2,6.156

He@ @'s another instance of the blessed effects of modern education ,
which has armed every witling with the weapons of personal satire :
MORTON-1813-2,6.157

- for now , cities are visited , MORTON-1813-2,6.158

tours are made , not to paint the world's beauties , but to caricature
its pitiable deformities ; not to cull the sweets of nature , but to
collect the poison of defamation - not to bestow instruction , but to
purvey to the insatiable appetite of slander , and teach the rising
generation to " prey on garbage . " MORTON-1813-2,6.159

- But where@ @'s your son Vincent ? MORTON-1813-2,6.160

<P_7>

<font> Temp. <$$font> I see little of him - MORTON-1813-2,7.162

he@ @'s all abstraction . MORTON-1813-2,7.163

<font> Damp. <$$font> Do him justice , MORTON-1813-2,7.164

he@ @'s all one thing , or all t'other - MORTON-1813-2,7.165

he@ @'s no retailer of the passions . MORTON-1813-2,7.166

You gave him the rein too soon . MORTON-1813-2,7.167

<font> Temp. <$$font> Too soon ! MORTON-1813-2,7.168

Did not he carry off the prize at school ? MORTON-1813-2,7.169

<font> Damp. <$$font> And did not he carry off the bedmaker's daughter
with it ? MORTON-1813-2,7.170

<font> Temp. <$$font> Did not his calculations make him a wrangler at
Cambridge ? <font> Damp. <$$font> And a tame pigeon at the club at St.
James's . MORTON-1813-2,7.171

- When he came to town he was all business : MORTON-1813-2,7.172

- he involved the house in speculations , MORTON-1813-2,7.173

then he was all extravagance - MORTON-1813-2,7.174

things went wrong , MORTON-1813-2,7.175

then he was all rage - MORTON-1813-2,7.176

that subsided , MORTON-1813-2,7.177

then he was all indolence . MORTON-1813-2,7.178

<font> Temp. <$$font> That accounts for his conduct -
MORTON-1813-2,7.179

he avoids me . MORTON-1813-2,7.180

<font> Damp. <$$font> Perhaps not ; MORTON-1813-2,7.181

for here he comes . MORTON-1813-2,7.182

<font> Temp. <$$font> Indeed ! MORTON-1813-2,7.183

I@ @'ll speak to him . MORTON-1813-2,7.184

<font> Damp. <$$font> Perhaps I had better do so ; MORTON-1813-2,7.185

your tenderness may overcome your fortitude . MORTON-1813-2,7.186

<font> Temp. <$$font> True , MORTON-1813-2,7.187

and your fortitude is in no such danger . MORTON-1813-2,7.188

<font> Damp. <$$font> Humph ! Perhaps 't@ @is tenderness for you both
makes me ask it . MORTON-1813-2,7.189

<font> Temp. <$$font> True , true , my friend ; MORTON-1813-2,7.190

grant me your pardon ! MORTON-1813-2,7.191

<font> Damp. <$$font> On condition you take it away with you instantly
. MORTON-1813-2,7.192

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> Templeton . MORTON-1813-2,7.193

<font> Enter <$$font> Vincent Templeton . MORTON-1813-2,7.194

<font> Vinc. <$$font> Hey day , Damper ! MORTON-1813-2,7.195

- what rare occurrence brought you here ? MORTON-1813-2,7.196

<font> Damp. <$$font> A very rare one , I assure you - friendship .
MORTON-1813-2,7.197

<font> Vinc. <$$font> 'T@ @is always under the sanction of that name
that grumblers annoy society . MORTON-1813-2,7.198

- Now for a lecture as long as a tailor's bill . MORTON-1813-2,7.199

<font> Damp. <$$font> That is unnecessary , when the total may be
expressed in one word - economy ! MORTON-1813-2,7.200

<P_8>

<font> Vinc. <$$font> I@ @'m its slave ; MORTON-1813-2,8.202

have not I sold my barouche and stud ? <font> Damp. <$$font> And lost
the produce at <font> Maccaw . <$$font> MORTON-1813-2,8.203

<font> Vinc. <$$font> That was unlucky ; MORTON-1813-2,8.204

but have not I discharged my lodgings ? MORTON-1813-2,8.205

<font> Damp. <$$font> What at Farmer Broadcast's ? MORTON-1813-2,8.206

<font> Vinc. <$$font> Confusion ! MORTON-1813-2,8.207

what do you mean , Sir ? MORTON-1813-2,8.208

<font> Damp. <$$font> Generally what I say - MORTON-1813-2,8.209

Poor Rosine ! MORTON-1813-2,8.210

<font> Vinc. <$$font> Ah , her name ! MORTON-1813-2,8.211

If you betray me ! MORTON-1813-2,8.212

<font> Damp. <$$font> Young man , if you despise the character of a
betrayer as much as I do , virtue and secrecy will be equally sacred .
MORTON-1813-2,8.213

<font> Vinc. <$$font> Rosine's virtue is sacred , MORTON-1813-2,8.214

and he merits chastisement that suspects it . MORTON-1813-2,8.215

<font> Damp. <$$font> And what does he merit who placed her in a
situation to justify suspicion . MORTON-1813-2,8.216

<font> Vinc. <$$font> ' Sdeath , how could you learn ?
MORTON-1813-2,8.217

<font> Damp. <$$font> Was it likely that a beautiful and accomplished
woman from a fashionable seminary should disappear without inquiry -
without wonder - without sorrow ? MORTON-1813-2,8.218

<font> Vinc. <$$font> Pshaw ! I@ @'m weary of your croaking .
MORTON-1813-2,8.219

<font> Damp. <$$font> Yet the raven must breathe a hoarser note - your
father - MORTON-1813-2,8.220

<font> Vinc. <paren> Alarmed <$$paren> <$$font> What of him ?
MORTON-1813-2,8.221

<font> Damp. <$$font> Is on the brink of ruin . MORTON-1813-2,8.222

<font> Vinc. <$$font> Ruin ! MORTON-1813-2,8.223

<font> Damp. <$$font> I fear inevitable ruin . MORTON-1813-2,8.224

<font> Vinc. <$$font> I dread to ask the cause . MORTON-1813-2,8.225

<font> Damp. <$$font> His son's indiscretion . MORTON-1813-2,8.226

<font> Vinc. <$$font> Oh , save me from that thought !
MORTON-1813-2,8.227

- May dishonour blast me , if the life he gave me is so precious as my
dear father's happiness ! MORTON-1813-2,8.228

- Let me fly to him . MORTON-1813-2,8.229

<font> Damp. <$$font> Hold ! MORTON-1813-2,8.230

he is as yet unacquainted with his situation - MORTON-1813-2,8.231

I am by his partners intrusted with the secret . MORTON-1813-2,8.232

Is this estate large ? MORTON-1813-2,8.233

intrigue , and self interest ; MORTON-1813-2,9.257

education whose object is rather to obtain the meed of public applause

the arts of obtaining a husband , rather than the duties of making one

At length the usual remittances did not arrive ; MORTON-1813-2,32.1005

the teachers I was thought capable of communicating the instruction I
