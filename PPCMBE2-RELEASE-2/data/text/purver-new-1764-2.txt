Chap. XII . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.4

<$$heading>

Jesus therefore six Days before the Passover came to Bethany , where
Lazarus was that died , whom he raised up from the Dead .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.6

Therefore they made a Supper for him there , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.7

and Martha served ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.8

but Lazarus was one of those who sat {TEXT:sate} down with him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.9

So Mary taking a Pound of Ointment , of exceeding precious liquid
Spikenard , anointed the Feet of Jesus , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.10

and wiped his Feet with her Hair ; insomuch that the House was filled
with the Savour of the Ointment . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.11

Says one of his Disciples therefore , Judas Iscariot Simon's <font> Son
, <$$font> who would deliver him up , For what reason was not that
Ointment sold for three_hundred Pence , and this given to the Poor ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.12

Whereas he said this , not because he cared for the Poor , but because
he was a Thief and had the Purse , and carried what was put in .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.13

Jesus therefore said ; Let her alone ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.14

she has kept this for the Day of my Burial . Since the Poor ye have
always with you but have not me always . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.15

A great Company therefore of the Jews knew that he was there ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.16

and came not for the sake of Jesus only , but that they might also see
Lazarus , whom he had raised up from the Dead .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.17

But the chief Priests consulted , that they might likewise put Lazarus
to death ; Because many of the Jews went by reason of him , and believed
in Jesus . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.18

On the next Day a great Company who were come to the Feast , hearing
that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem , Took Branches of Palm-trees
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.19

and went out to meet him , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.20

and cried out , Pray save , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.21

the King of Israel who comes in the Name of the Lord is blessed .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.22

Moreover Jesus finding a young Ass , sat {TEXT:sate} upon it , as it is
written , Do not fear , O Daughter of Zion : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.23

behold thy King comes , sitting upon the Colt of an Ass .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.24

However his Disciples knew not these Things at first ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.25

but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembred that these Things
were written of him , and that they did these Things to him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.26

Therefore the Company testified <font> for him <$$font> , which was with
him when he called Lazarus out of the Grave , and raised him up from the
Dead . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.27

For this reason also the Company met him , because they heard that he
had done this Miracle . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.28

The Pharisees therefore said one to an other , Do you see that we profit
not any Thing ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.29

Lo the World is gone away after him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1J.30

<P_12,20J>

And there were some Grecians of those who came up , that they might
worship at the Feast ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.32

These came therefore to Philip , who was from Bethsaida of Galilee ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.33

and thus intreated him , Lord , we would see Jesus .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.34

Philip comes , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.35

and tells Andrew ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.36

and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.37

Upon which Jesus made answer to them : The Hour is come for the Man to
be glorified . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.38

I say to you very certainly ; Except a Grain of Wheat falls into the
Ground , and dies , only that remains ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.39

but if it dies , it bears much Fruit . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.40

He that loves his Life , will lose it ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.41

and he who slights his Life in this World , will keep it to everlasting
Life . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.42

If any one would wait on me , let him follow me ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.43

so where I am , there also will my Servant be :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.44

and if any one waits on me , the Father will honour him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.45

My Soul is now troubled , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.46

and what shall I say ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.47

O Father , save me from this Hour ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.48

but for the foregoing I am come to it . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.49

O Father , glorify thy Name . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.50

Therefore a Voice came from Heaven , I have both glorified ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.51

and will glorify again . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.52

The Company therefore that stood by , and heard , said it was Thunder :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.53

others said , An Angel spoke to him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.54

Jesus made answer ; This Voice was not for my sake , but for yours .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.55

Now is the Judgment of this World , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.56

now will the Prince of this World be cast out abroad .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.57

And when I am lifted up from the Earth , I will draw all to my self .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.58

<paren> But this he spoke , signifying by what Death he should die
<$$paren> PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.59

The Company answered him ; We have heard out of the Law , that Christ
remains for ever ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.60

how then dost Thou say , The Man must be lifted up ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.61

Who is this Man ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.62

Therefore Jesus said to them ; The Light is with you yet a little Time :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.63

walk while you have the Light , that Darkness may not seize you ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.64

and he who walks in Darkness , does not know whither he goes ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.65

While you have the Light , believe in the Light , that you may be the
Sons of it . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.66

These Things Jesus spoke , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.67

and when he went away , hid from them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.68

Nevertheless though he had done so many Miracles before them , they did
not believe in him ; So that the Saying of the Prophet Esaias was
fulfilled , which he spoke , Lord , who has believed our Report ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.69

And to whom has the Arm of the Lord been revealed ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20J.70

For this reason they could not believe , because said Esaias again ,
<P_12,40J> He has let their Eyes be blinded , and their Heart be
hardened ; lest they should see with the Eyes , understand with the
Heart , and when they are converted , I might heal them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.71

These Things Esaias said , when he saw his Glory ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.72

and spoke concerning him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.73

Yet indeed many even of the Rulers believed in him ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.74

but did not confess , lest they should not belong to the Synagogue .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.75

For they loved the Glory of Men , rather than the Glory of God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.76

Jesus further cried out in this manner : He that believes in me , does
not <font> properly <$$font> in me , but in him who sent me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.77

Besides he that sees me , sees him who sent me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.78

I am come a Light into the World , that every one who believes in me may
not remain in Darkness . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.79

And if any one hears my Words , and does not believe , I do not judge
him : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.80

for I came not that I might judge the World , but that I might save it .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.81

He that rejects you , and does not receive my Words , has what will
judge him : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.82

the Word which I have spoken , that will judge him at the last Day .
Because I have not spoken of my self ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.83

but the Father who sent me , he gave me a Commandment what I should say
, and what I should speak . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.84

And I know that his Commandment is everlasting Life :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.85

what Things therefore I speak , it is so as the Father told me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,40J.86

Chap. XIII . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.89

<$$heading>

At length before the Feast of the Passover , Jesus knowing that his Hour
was come , for him to depart out of this World to the Father ; as he had
loved his own who were in the World , he loved them till the End .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.91

And when Supper was done <paren> the Devil having now put into the Heart
of Judas Iscariot <font> the Son <$$font> of Simon , that he should
deliver him up <$$paren> Jesus knowing that the Father had given him all
Things into Hand , and that he came out from God , and was going to God
; He rises up from Supper , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.92

and puts away the Garments ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.93

then taking a Towel , girded himself . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.94

Afterwards he puts Water into a Bason , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.95

and began to wash the Feet of the Disciples , and to wipe with the Towel
that he was girded with . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.96

So he comes to Simon Peter , who says to him , Lord , dost Thou wash my
Feet ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.97

Jesus made answer to him , What I do , thou dost not know now ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.98

but thou wilt know when these Things are past .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.99

Peter says to him , Thou shalt never wash my Feet at all .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.100

Jesus answered him , If I do not wash thee , thou hast no Part with me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.101

Simon Peter replies to him , Lord , not my Feet only , but also the
Hands and Head . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.102

Jesus rejoins to him , He that is washed has no more Need than to wash
the Feet , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.103

but is wholly clean ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.104

and you are clean , but not all . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.105

For He knew who would deliver him up ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.106

for this reason he said , You are not all clean .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.107

When he had therefore washed their Feet , and taken his Garments , being
sat {TEXT:sate} down , he said to them : Do ye know what I have done to
you ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.108

You call me Master and Lord ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.109

and you say well , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.110

for I am . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.111

If I therefore the Lord and Master have washed your Feet , you also
ought to wash the Feet one of another . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.112

For I have given you an Example , that ye should also do as I have done
to you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1J.113

<P_13,20J>

I say to you very certainly , A Servant is not greater than his Master ,
nor an Apostle greater than he who sent him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.115

If you know these Things , you are blessed if you do them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.116

I speak not concerning you all , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.117

I know whom I have chosen ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.118

but <font> it <$$font> is that the Scripture may be fulfilled ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.119

He that eats Bread with me , has lifted his Heel against me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.120

I tell you even now before it comes to pass , that when it does , you
may believe that it is I . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.121

I say to you very certainly , He that receives whomsoever I send ,
receives me ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.122

and he that receives me , does him who sent me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.123

Jesus having said these Things , was troubled in Spirit ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.124

and testified in this manner , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.125

I tell you very certainly , that one of you will deliver me up .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.126

Therefore the Disciples looked one at another , doubting about whom he
spoke . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.127

Now there was leaning on the Bosom of Jesus one of his Disciples , whom
he loved . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.128

Simon Peter therefore nodded to him , to ask who it would be about whom
he spoke . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.129

So he lying down upon the Breast of Jesus , says to him , Lord , who is
it ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.130

Jesus answered , It is he to whom , having dipt , I shall give a Bit ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.131

and dipping in a Bit , he gave <font> it <$$font> to Judas Iscariot
<font> the Son <$$font> of Simon . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.132

And after the Bit then Satan entered into him ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.133

Jesus therefore says to him , What thou doest , do quickly .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.134

But none who sat {TEXT:sate} down knew why he spoke this to him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.135

For some thought , since Judas had the Purse , that Jesus said to him ,
Buy what Things we have Need of against the Feast ; or that he should
give Something to the Poor . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.136

Therefore he having the Bit , presently went out ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.137

and it was Night when he thus went . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.138

Jesus says ; Now is the Man glorified , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.139

and God is glorified in him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.140

If God be so , he will also glorify him in himself ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.141

and will glorify him presently . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.142

Little Children , I am with you yet a little while :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.143

ye will seek me , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.144

and as I said to the Jews , Whither I go , ye can@ @not come ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.145

so now I say to you . I give you a new Commandment , that ye should
love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye should also love one
another . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.146

By this will all know that you are my Disciples , if you have Love one
to another . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.147

Simon Peter says to him , Lord , whither dost thou go ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.148

Jesus answered him , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.149

but wilt hereafter . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.150

Peter replies to him , Lord , for what reason can@ @not I follow thee at
present ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.151

I will lay down my Life for thee . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.152

Jesus answered him ; Wilt thou lay down thy Life for me ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.153

I say to thee very certainly , The Cock will not at all crow , until
thou hast thrice denied me . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20J.154

Chap. XIV . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.157

<$$heading>

Let not your Heart be troubled : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.159

believe in God , as also in me believe . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.160

In my Father's House there are many Habitations ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.161

and if not , I would have told you : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.162

I go before to prepare a Place for you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.163

And if I go , and prepare for you a Place , I will come again , and
receive you to my self ; that where I am , you may also be .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.164

Moreover whither I go you know , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.165

and know the Way . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.166

Thomas says to him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.167

and how can we know the Way ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.168

Jesus replies to him , I am the Way , and the Truth , and the Life :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.169

none comes to the Father but by me . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.170

If you had known me , you would also have known my Father ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.171

and henceforth you know him , as well as have seen him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.172

Says Philip to him , Lord , shew us the Father ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.173

and it is sufficient for us . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.174

Jesus says to him : Am I such a long Time with you ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.175

and hast not thou known me , Philip ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.176

He who has seen me , has seen the Father ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.177

and how dost thou say , Shew us the Father ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.178

Dost not thou believe that I am in the Father , and the Father is in me
? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.179

The Words which I speak to you , I speak not from my self ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.180

but the Father himself who remains in me does the Works .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.181

Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father is in me
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.182

but if not , believe me by reason of the Works themselves .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.183

I say to you very certainly , He that believes in me , the Works which I
do , he shall also do , nay shall do greater than these ; because I go
to my Father . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.184

And whatever you shall request in my Name , this will I do ? that the
Father may be glorified in the Son . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.185

If you shall request any Thing in my Name , I will do <font> it <$$font>
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.186

If you love me , keep my Commandments . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.187

And I will ask of the Father , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.188

and he will give you another Comforter , that he may remain with you for
ever ; The Spirit of Truth , whom the World can@ @not receive , because
it does not see him , nor know him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.189

but ye know him , because he remains with you , and shall be in you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.190

I will not leave you fatherless , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.191

I will come to you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.192

In a little while the World sees me no more ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.193

but you see me : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.194

because I live , you also will . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1J.195

<P_14,20J>

At that Time you will know , that I am in the Father , and you in me ,
and I in you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.197

He who has my Commandments , and keeps them , that is he who loves me ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.198

now he who loves me will be loved by my Father ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.199

and I will love him , as also make my self manifest to him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.200

Judas , not Iscariot , says to him , Lord , how is it that thou art
about to make thy self manifest to us , and not to the World ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.201

Jesus made answer to him : If any one loves me , he will keep my Word ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.202

so my Father will love him , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.203

nay we will come to him , and make a Habitation with him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.204

He that does not love me , keeps not my Words ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.205

and the Word which you hear is not mine , but the Father's who sent me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.206

These Things have I spoken to you , while I remain with you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.207

But the Comforter , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my
Name , will himself teach you all Things , and bring all to your
remembrance , which I have said to you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.208

I leave Peace to you , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.209

give you my Peace ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.210

not as the World gives , do I give you : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.211

let not your Heart be troubled , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.212

nor be afraid . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.213

You have heard that I said to you , I go away ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.214

and come to you : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.215

if you loved me , you would have been glad that I said , I go to the
Father ; because my Father is greater {TEXT:missing_"greater"} than I .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.216

Besides I have now told you before it comes to pass ; that when it does
, you may believe . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.217

I shall not speak many Things further with you :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.218

for the Prince of this World is coming , though he has not any Thing in
{TEXT:missing_"in"} me . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.219

But <font> it <$$font> is in order for the World to know that I love the
Father ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.220

and as he has commanded me , so I do . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.221

Rise up , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.222

let us go along hence . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20J.223

Chap. XV . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.226

<$$heading>

I am the true Vine , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.228

and my Father is the Husbandman . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.229

Every Branch in me which does not bear Fruit , that he takes away ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.230

and every one which bears Fruit , that he cleanses , that it may bear
more Fruit . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.231

You are already clean by the Word which I have spoken to you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.232

Remain in me , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.233

and <font> let me <$$font> in you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.234

As a Branch can@ @not bear Fruit of it self , except it remains in the
Vine , so neither you , except you remain in me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.235

I am the Vine , you the Branches : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.236

he that remains in me , and I in him , bears much Fruit ; since without
me you can@ @not do any Thing . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.237

Except any one remains in me , he is cast out abroad as a Branch , even
a withered one ; so that People gather them together , and cast into the
Fire , and they are burned . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.238

If you remain in me , and my Sayings remain in you , ye may request
whatsoever ye will , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.239

and it shall be done for you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.240

In this my Father is glorified , that you bear much Fruit ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.241

so shall you become Disciples to me . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.242

As the Father has loved me , I have also loved you :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.243

remain in my Love . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.244

If you keep my Commandments , you will remain in my Love ; as I have
kept the Commandments of my Father , and remain in his Love .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.245

These Things have I spoken to you , that my Joy might remain in you ,
and yours might be fulfilled . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.246

This is my Commandment , that ye should love one another , as I have
loved you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.247

Greater Love than this none has , that any one should lay down his Life
for his Friend - . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.248

Ye are my Friends , if ye do whatever I command you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.249

I no more call you Servants , since a Servant knows not what his Master
does ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.250

but I call you Friends , since all Things which I have heard from my
Father have I made known to you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.251

Ye did not choose me , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.252

but I chose you , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.253

and appointed you , that ye might go , and bear Fruit , and your Fruit
might remain ; that whatsoever ye shall request the Father in my Name ,
he may give it you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.254

These Things I command you , that ye love one another .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.255

If the World hates you , ye know that it hated me before you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.256

If ye were of the World , that would love its own ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.257

whereas since ye are not of the World , but I have chosen you out of it
, for this reason the World hates you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1J.258

<P_15,20J>

Remember the Words which I said to you , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.260

a Servant is not greater than his Master . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.261

If they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.262

if they have kept my Words ; they will also keep yours .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.263

But all these Things will they do to you by reason of my Name , since
they know not him who sent me , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.264

If I had not come , and spoken to them , they would not have had Sin ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.265

but now they have no Excuse for their Sin PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.266

He that hates me , hates also my Father . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.267

If I had not done Works among them which no other did , they would not
have had Sin ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.268

but now they have both seen , and hated even me and my Father .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.269

But <font> it <$$font> is that the Saying might be fulfilled , which is
written in their Law , that they hated me undeservedly .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.270

However when the Comforter is come ; whom I will send to you from the
Father , the Spirit of Truth who comes out from him , he will testify
concerning me . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.271

And you also will testify , because you have been with me from the
Beginning . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20J.272

<P_16,1J>

<heading>

Chap. XVI . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.275

<$$heading>

These Things have I spoken to you ; that ye might not be offended .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.277

They will make you not belong to the Synagogue ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.278

nay the Time is coming , that any one who kills you , will think he
brings Service to God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.279

And these Things will they do to you , because they have not known the
father , nor me . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.280

But these Things have I spoken to you , that when the Time comes , ye
may remember of them that I told you ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.281

however I did not tell you these Things at the Beginning , because I was
with you . Whereas now I go to him who sent me ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.282

and none of you asks me , Whither dost thou go ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.283

Nevertheless because I have spoken these Things to you , Grief has
filled your Heart . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.284

Yet I tell you the Truth , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.285

it is profitable for you that I should go away :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.286

for if I do not the Comforter will not come to you ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.287

but if I go , I will send him to you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.288

And when he comes , he will convince the World concerning Sin ,
concerning Righteousness , and also Judgment : Concerning Sin indeed ,
because they do not believe in me ; Concerning Righteousness , because I
go to my Father , and you see me no more ; And concerning Judgment ,
because the Prince of this World is judged .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.289

I have yet many Things to speak to you , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.290

but ye can@ @not bear <font> them <$$font> now .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.291

However when the Spirit of Truth himself comes , he will guide you into
all Truth : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.292

for he will not speak of himself , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.293

but whatever he shall hear will speak , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.294

and he will tell you Things that are to come .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.295

He will glorify me ; because he will receive of mine , and tell you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.296

All Things whatever the Father has are mine :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.297

for this reason I said , that he will receive of mine , and tell you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.298

In a little while you will not see me , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.299

and again in a little while you will behold me , because I go to my
Father . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.300

Some of his Disciples therefore said one to another ; What is this that
he says to us , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.301

In a little while you will not see me , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.302

and again in a little while you will behold me ; and , Because I go to
the Father ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.303

Therefore they said , What is this that he says , the little while ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.304

We know not what he says . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.305

Jesus therefore knew that they were minded to ask him ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.306

so he said to them : Are you seeking one with another concerning this ,
because I said , In a little while you will not see me ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.307

and again in a little while you will behold me ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1J.308

<P_16,20J>

I say to you very certainly , that ye will weep , and mourn ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.310

but the World will rejoice ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.311

and ye will grieve , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.312

yet your Grief will become Joy . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.313

A Woman when she is in labour , has Grief , because her Hour is come ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.314

but when she has brought forth the Child , she remembers the Affliction
no more , for Joy that a Man is born into the World .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.315

So ye also indeed have now Grief ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.316

but I will see you again , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.317

and your Heart shall rejoice , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.318

and your Joy none takes away from you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.319

Nay at that Time ye shall not ask me any Thing :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.320

<font> for <$$font> I tell you very certainly , that whatsoever ye shall
request of the Father in my Name , he will give you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.321

Hitherto ye have not requested any Thing in my Name :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.322

do ye request , and receive , that your Joy may be full .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.323

These Things have I spoken to you in Proverbs ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.324

but the Time is coming when I shall speak to you no more in Proverbs ,
but shall tell you freely concerning the Father .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.325

At that Time ye shall request in my Name ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.326

and I do not say to you , that I will ask of the Father for you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.327

For the Father himself loves you ; because ye have loved me , and
believed that I came out from God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.328

I came out from the Father , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.329

and am come into the World ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.330

again I leave the World , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.331

and go to the Father . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.332

His Disciples said to him ; Lo now thou speakest freely ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.333

and speakest no Proverb . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.334

Now we know that thou knowest all Things , and hast no Need that any one
should ask thee : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.335

by this we believe that thou camest out from God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.336

Jesus answered them ; Do ye now believe ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.337

Behold the Time is coming , nay is already come , that you will be
dispersed each to his own , and leave me alone ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.338

yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.339

These Things have I spoken to you , that in me you might have Peace :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.340

in the World you will have Affliction ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20J.341

but take courage , I having , overcome the World .

Chap. XVII . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.345

<$$heading>

These Things Jesus spoke , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.347

and looked up to Heaven , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.348

and said : Father , the Time is come ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.349

glorify thy Son , that he may also glorify thee : According as thou hast
given him Authority over all Flesh , that he may give everlasting Life
to all whom thou hast given to him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.350

And this is everlasting Life , for them to know thee the only true God ,
and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.351

I have glorified thee upon the Earth ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.352

have finished the Work which thou gavest me to do .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.353

So now do thou glorify me , Father , with thy self , in the Glory which
I had with thee before the World was . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.354

I have made thy Name manifest to the Men whom thou gavest me out of the
World : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.355

they were thine , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.356

and thou gavest them to me , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.357

and they have kept thy Word . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.358

They have now known , that all Things whatever thou hast given me , are
from thee : Because I have given them the Words which thou gavest me ;
which they have received , and known truly that I came out from thee ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.359

and they have believed that thou didst send me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.360

I intreat for them : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.361

I do not intreat for the World , but for them whom thou hast given me ,
because they are thine . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.362

Moreover all my Things are thine , and thy Things mine ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.363

and I am glorified in them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.364

And now I am no more in the World , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.365

but these are , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.366

and I come to thee . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.367

Keep those , Holy Father , in thy Name whom thou hast given me ; that
they may be one , according as we are . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.368

When I was with them in the World , I kept them in thy Name :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.369

those whom thou gavest me I have preserved , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.370

and none of them is lost , excepting the Son of Destruction , that the
Scripture might be fulfilled . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.371

But now I come to thee , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.372

and these Things I speak in the World , that they may have my Joy
fulfilled in themselves . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.373

I have given to them thy Word , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.374

and the World has hated them , because they are not of the World ,
according as I am not ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.375

I do not intreat that thou wouldest take them out of the World , but
that thou wouldest keep them from Wickedness .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.376

They are not of the World , according as I am not .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.377

Sanctify them in thy Truth , thy Word being the Truth .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.378

According as thou hast sent me into the World , I have also sent them
thither . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.379

And for them I sanctify my self , that they likewise may be sanctified
in the Truth . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1J.380

<P_17,20J>

However I do not intreat for these only , but for them also who shall
believe in me by their Word : That they may all be one ; according as
thou , Father , art in me , and I in thee , that they likewise may be
one in us ; in order for the World to believe that thou hast sent me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20J.382

And I have given them the Glory which thou gavest me ; that they may be
one , as we are one : I in them , and thou in me ; that they may be made
perfect in one , and in order for the World to know that thou sentest me
, and didst love them , as thou didst me . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20J.383

Father , I am willing that those also whom thou hast given to me ,
should be with me where I am ; that they may see my Glory which thou
gavest me , because thou didst love me before the founding of the World
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20J.384

Righteous Father , though the World has not known thee , yet I have ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20J.385

and these have known that thou hast sent me ; To whom I have made known
thy Name , and will do <font> it <$$font> ; that the Love which thou
hast loved me with may be in them , and I in them .

Chap. XVIII . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.389

<$$heading>

Jesus having said these Things , went out with his Disciples beyond the
Brook Kedron , where there was a Garden , into which he entered , and
his Disciples . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.391

Now Judas too that delivered him up knew the Place ; because Jesus often
gathered together there with his Disciples .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.392

Judas therefore having received a Regiment , and from the chief Priests
and Pharisees Officers , comes thither with Lanterns , Lamps and Arms .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.393

Therefore Jesus knowing all Things which would come upon him , went out
, PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.394

and said to them , Whom do ye seek after ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.395

They answered him , Jesus the Nazorite . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.396

Jesus says to them , It is I . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.397

And Judas also that delivered him up stood with them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.398

When he therefore said to them , It is I ; they went away backward ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.399

and fell on the Ground . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.400

He therefore again asked them , Whom do ye seek after ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.401

And they said , Jesus the Nazorite . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.402

Jesus answered , I have told you , that it is I ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.403

if therefore ye seek after me , let these go :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.404

That the Word might be fulfilled which he said ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.405

I have not lost any of them whom thou gavest me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.406

Therefore Simon Peter having a Sword , drew it ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.407

and smote a Servant of the high Priest , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.408

and cut off his right Ear ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.409

and the Servant's Name was Malchus . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.410

Jesus therefore said to Peter , Put thy Sword into the Sheath ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.411

shall I not at all drink that Cup which my Father has given me ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.412

So the Regiment , the Colonel , and Officers of the Jews took Jesus ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.413

and bound him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.414

Next they brought him away to Annas first : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.415

for he was the Father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was the high Priest for
that Year . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.416

And it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews , that it would be profitable ,
that one Man should perish for the People . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.417

There followed Jesus notwithstanding Simon Peter , and another Disciple
; which Disciple was known by the high Priest , and went in with Jesus
into the high Priest's Hall . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.418

But Peter stood at the Door without ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.419

therefore the other Disciple went out , who was known by the high Priest
, PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.420

and spoke to the Porter , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.421

and brought in Peter . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.422

The young Woman that was Porter therefore says to Peter , Art not thou
also one of this Man's Disciples ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.423

He says , I am not . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.424

The Servants and Officers also stood by , making a Coal-fire , because
it was cold , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.425

and warmed themselves ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.426

so Peter was standing with them , and warming himself .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.427

The high Priest therefore asked Jesus , both concerning his Disciples
and Doctrine . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,1J.428

<P_18,20J>

Jesus answered him ; I have spoken publickly to the World :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.430

I always taught in the Synagogue and the Temple , whither the Jews
always come together , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.431

and have spoken Nothing in Secret . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.432

Why dost thou ask me ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.433

Ask the Hearers , what I have spoken to them ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.434

lo they know the Things which I said . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.435

But upon his saying these Things , one of the Officers who stood by gave
Jesus a Stroke , saying , Dost thou answer the high Priest thus ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.436

Jesus replied to him , If I have spoken ill , testify concerning the ill
; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.437

but if well , why dost thou beat me ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.438

Annas having sent him bound to Caiaphas the high Priest .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.439

Now Simon Peter was standing , and warming himself ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.440

therefore they said to him , Art not thou also one of his Disciples ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.441

He denied by saying , I am not . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.442

Says one of the high Priest's Servants , that was a Kinsman of him whose
Ear Peter cut off , Did not I see thee in the Garden with him ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.443

Therefore Peter denied again ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.444

and presently the Cock crowed . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.445

They therefore carried Jesus from Caiaphas into the Judgment-hall , as
it was Morning ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.446

however they themselves did not enter in thither , that they might not
be defiled , but that they might eat the Passover .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.447

Pilate therefore went out to them , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.448

and said , What Accusation . do ye bring against this Man ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.449

They made answer to him , If he was not a Criminal , we should not have
delivered him up to thee . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.450

Therefore Pilate replied to them , Do ye take him , and judge him
according to your Law . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.451

The Jews therefore said to him , It is not lawful for us to put any one
to death : That the Word of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he said ,
signifying by what Kind of Death he should die .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.452

Pilate therefore entered into the Judgment-hall again ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.453

and called Jesus , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.454

and said to him , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.455

Jesus answered him , . Dost thou speak this of thy self ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.456

or did others tell thee concerning me ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.457

Pilate replied , Am I a Jew ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.458

Thy Nation and the chief Priests . delivered thee up to me ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.459

what hast thou done ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.460

My Kingdom answered Jesus , is not of this World :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.461

if it was of that , my Attendants would strive , that I might not be
delivered up to the Jews ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.462

but now my Kingdom is not from hence . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.463

Therefore Pilate asked him , Art not thou then a King ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.464

Jesus answered Thou sayest <font> it , <$$font>
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.465

I am a King . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.466

I was born for this , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.467

and for this came into the World , that I might testify to the Truth :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.468

every one who is of the Truth hears my Voice .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.469

Says Pilate to him , . What is Truth ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.470

And having spoken this , he went out again to the Jews ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.471

and declares to them ; I find no Crime in him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.472

But there is a Custom to you , that I should release one at the Passover
; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.473

are ye willing therefore I should release to you the King of the Jews ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,20J.474

<P_18,40J>

They therefore all cried out again thus , Not him , but Barabbas .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,40J.476

Now Barabbas was a Robber . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,18,40J.477

<P_19,1J>

<heading>

Chap. XIX . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.480

<$$heading>

Then Pilate therefore took , and scourged Jesus . As also the Soldiers
plaiting a Crown of Briers , put , <font> it <$$font> on his Head , and
cloathed him with a purple Garment ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.482

Moreover they said , Hail , King of the Jews ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.483

and gave him Strokes . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.484

Therefore Pilate went forth again , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.485

and says to them , Lo I bring him out to you , in order for you to know
that I find no Crime in him , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.486

Jesus therefore , came forth , wearing the thorny Crown , and the purple
Garment ; upon which he says to them , Behold , the Man .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.487

So when , the chief Priests and Officers saw him , they cried out thus ,
Crucify , crucify . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.488

Pilate says to them , Do ye take , and crucify him :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.489

for I find not a Crime in him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.490

The Jews answered him , We have a Law , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.491

and according to our Law he ought to die , because he made himself the
Son of God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.492

When Pilate therefore heard this Saying , he was more afraid .
Whereupon , he entered into the Judgment-hall again , and says to Jesus
, Whence art thou ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.493

But Jesus gave him no Answer . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.494

Therefore Pilate says to him , Dost not thou speak to me ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.495

Knowest not thou that I have both Power to crucify thee , and Power to
release thee ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.496

Jesus answered , Thou wouldest have no Power against me , if it was not
given thee from above : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.497

for this reason he that delivered me up to thee has the greater Sin .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.498

Thenceforth Pilate endeavoured to release him ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.499

but the Jews cried out as follows , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.500

If thou releasest him , thou art not Cesar's Friend :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.501

every one who makes himself a King contradicts Cesar .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.502

Pilate therefore hearing this Saying , brought Jesus out ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.503

and sat {TEXT:sate} down on the Judgment-seat , in a Place called the
Pavement , but in Hebrew Gabbatha . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.504

Now it was the Preparation of the Passover , and about the sixth Hour ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.505

and he says to the Jews , Behold your King .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.506

But they cried out , Take away , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.507

take away , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.508

crucify him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.509

Pilate says to them , Shall I crucify your King ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.510

The chief Priests answered , We have no King but Cesar .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.511

Then he delivered him up therefore to them , that he might be crucified
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.512

Thus they took , and brought away Jesus . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.513

And he bearing his Cross , went out to a Place called the Scull one ,
which is called in Hebrew Golgotha . Where they crucified him , and two
others with him , at each Side , and Jesus in the Middle .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.514

And Pilate too wrote a Title , and put on the Cross ; which was written
, Jesus the Nazorite {COM:sic} the King of the Jews .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,1J.515

<P_19,20J>

This Title therefore many of the Jews read , because the Place where
Jesus was crucified was near the City ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.517

and it was written in Hebrew , Greek , Latin .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.518

Therefore the chief Priests of the Jews said to Pilate ; Do not write ,
The King of the Jews , but that he said , I am the King of the Jews .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.519

Pilate answered , What I have written , I have written .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.520

The Soldiers therefore , when they had crucified Jesus , took his
Garments <paren> and made four Parts , to each Soldier a Part <$$paren>
with the Coat ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.521

now the Coat was without Seam , woven from above all through .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.522

They therefore said one to another , Let us not part it , but make lots
concerning it , whose it shall be ; that the Scripture might be
fulfilled which says , They divided my Garments to themselves ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.523

and cast Lots for my Cloaths : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.524

therefore indeed the Soldiers did these Things .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.525

There stood also by the Cross of Jesus , his Mother , and his Mother's
Sister Mary <font> the Wife <$$font> of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.526

Therefore Jesus seeing the Mother , and the Disciples whom he loved
standing by , says to his Mother , Woman , behold thy Son .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.527

Afterwards he says to the Disciples , behold thy Mother .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.528

So from that Hour the Disciples took her to those of his own .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.529

After this Jesus knowing that all Things were now accomplished , that
the Scripture might be compleat , says , I am thirsty .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.530

A Vessel therefore was set full of Vinegar ; whereupon they filled a
Sponge with it , which putting upon Hyssop , they conveyed to his Mouth
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.531

When Jesus therefore had received the Vinegar , he said , It is
accomplished ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.532

next bowing the Head , he delivered up the Spirit .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.533

Therefore the Jews , that the Bodies might not remain upon the Cross on
the Sabbath , since it was the Preparation <paren> for that Sabbath was
a great Day <$$paren> intreated Pilate that their Legs might be broke ,
and they taken away . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.534

The Soldiers therefore indeed came , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.535

and broke the Legs of the first , and of the other who was crucified
with him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.536

But coming to Jesus , when they saw that he was dead already , they did
not break his Legs . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.537

Yet one of the Soldiers with a Spear pierced his Side ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.538

and presently there came out Blood and Water .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.539

And he who saw has testified , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.540

and his Testimony is true ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.541

nay he knows that he speaks true Things , to the end that you may
believe . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.542

For these Things were done , that the Scripture might be fulfilled ,
There shall not a Bone of him be broke . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.543

And again another Scripture says , They shall look on him , whom they
have pierced . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.544

Now after these Things Joseph one from Arimathea <paren> who was a
Disciple of Jesus , but concealed for Fear of the Jews <$$paren>
intreated Pilate that he might take away the Body of Jesus ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.545

and Pilate permitted him : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.546

he therefore came , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.547

and took it away . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.548

Nay Nicodemus also came <paren> who first came to Jesus by Night
<$$paren> bringing a Mixture of Myrrh and Aloes , about a_hundred Pounds
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,20J.549

<P_19,40J>

Therefore they took the Body of Jesus , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,40J.551

and tied it up in linen Cloaths , with the Spices , as the Manner of the
Jews is to bury . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,40J.552

Besides there was in the Place , where he was crucified , a Garden ; and
in that a new Grave , into which was not any one yet put .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,40J.553

There they therefore laid Jesus , by reason of the Jews Preparation ,
because the Grave was near . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,19,40J.554

<P_20,1J>

<heading>

Chap. XX . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.557

<$$heading>

Afterwards on the first <font> Day <$$font> after the Sabbath , Mary
Magdalene comes in the Morning , while it was dark , to the Grave ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.559

and sees the Stone taken away from it . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.560

Therefore she runs , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.561

and comes to Simon Peter , and to the other Disciples whom Jesus loved ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.562

and says to them , They have taken away the Lord from the Grave ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.563

and we know not where they have put him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.564

Peter therefore went out , and the other Disciples ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.565

and they came to the Grave . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.566

However though they ran both together , the other Disciples quickly ran
before Peter , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.567

and came first to the Grave . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.568

Who stooping down , beheld the linen Cloaths lying ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.569

nevertheless he did not go in . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.570

Simon Peter therefore that followed him comes ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.571

and entered into the Grave , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.572

and saw the linen Cloaths lying ; As also the Napkin that was upon his
Head , not lying with the linen Cloaths , but wrapt up in another Place
apart . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.573

Then went in therefore the other Disciple also , who came first to the
Grave ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.574

and he saw , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.575

and believed . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.576

For they did not yet know the Scripture that he must rise from the Dead
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.577

Therefore the Disciples went away to those who belonged to them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.578

But Mary stood at the Grave weeping without ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.579

as she wept therefore , she stooped down . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.580

With that she sees two Angels in White sitting , one at the Head , and
one at the Feet , where the Body of Jesus had lain .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.581

And they ask her , Woman , why dost thou weep ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.582

She says to them , Because they have taken away my Lord ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.583

and I know not where they have put him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.584

Moreover having said thus , she turned about backward ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.585

and sees Jesus standing ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.586

and did not know that it was he . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.587

Jesus asks her , Woman , why dost thou weep ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.588

Whom dost seek for ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.589

She , thinking that he was the Gardener , says to him , Master , if thou
hast carried him away , tell me where thou hast put him , and I will
take him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.590

Jesus says to her , Mary . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.591

She turning about , says to him , Rabbouni , which is to say Master .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.592

Replies Jesus to her ; Meddle not with me : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.593

for I do not yet go up to my Father ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.594

but go thou to my Brethren , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.595

and tell them , I am going to my Father and yours , with my God and
yours . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.596

Mary Magdalene comes , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.597

and declares to the Disciples , that she had seen the Lord , and he told
her these Things . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.598

When it was therefore the Evening of that Day , on the first after the
Sabbath ; the Doors being shut , where the Disciples were assembled
together for Fear of the Jews , Jesus came , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.599

and stood in the midst , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.600

and says to them , Peace be to you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,1J.601

<P_20,20J>

And having pronounced this , he shewed them his Hands and Side .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.603

Therefore the Disciples rejoiced at seeing the Lord .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.604

Jesus therefore said to them again , Peace be to you :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.605

as the Father sent me , I also send you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.606

This having likewise expressed , he breathed on , and says to them ;
Receive the Holy Spirit . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.607

The Sins of whomsoever you forgive , they are forgiven to them ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.608

{COM:sc._The_sins} of whomsoever you hold fast , those are held fast .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.609

But Thomas one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when
Jesus came . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.610

Therefore the other Disciples told him , We have seen the Lord .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.611

But he said to them , Except I should behold in his Hands the Mark of
the Nails , nay should put my Finger on the Mark of them , as also put
my Hand on his Side , I would not at all believe .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.612

So eight Days after his Disciples were again within , and Thomas with
them ; <font> when <$$font> Jesus comes , the Doors being shut , and
stood in the midst , and said , Peace be to you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.613

Afterwards he says to Thomas , Put forth thy Finger hither ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.614

and behold my Hands ; as likewise reach out thy Hand , and put on my
Side : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.615

thus be not unbelieving , but believing . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.616

At this Thomas made answer to him , <font> Thou <$$font> art my Lord ,
and my God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.617

Jesus replies to him , Because thou hast seen me , Thomas , thou hast
believed : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.618

they are blessed who have not beheld , and yet have believed .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.619

Many other Miracles therefore indeed Jesus also did before his Disciples
, which are not written in this Book . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.620

But these are written , that you may believe that Jesus is Christ the
Son of God ; and that believing , you may have Life in his Name .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,20,20J.621

<P_21,1J>

<heading>

Chap. XXI . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.624

<$$heading>

After these Things Jesus made himself manifest again to the Disciples ,
at the Sea of Tiberias ; which he did thus .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.626

There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , as also
Nathanael from Cana of Galilee , and the Sons of Zebedee , with two
others of his Disciples . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.627

Simon Peter tells them , I am going a fishing ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.628

they say to him , We are also coming with thee :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.629

they went out , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.630

and got into a Ship presently , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.631

and in that Night caught Nothing . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.632

But when it was now Morning Jesus stood on the Shoar ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.633

nevertheless the Disciples did not know that it was he .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.634

Jesus therefore says to them , Children , have you any Meat ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.635

They answered him , No . Upon which he replied to them , Cast the Net
on the right Part of the Ship , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.636

and you will find . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.637

They therefore cast , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.638

and were no longer able to draw it for the Multitude of the Fishes .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.639

Therefore that Disciple whom Jesus loved says to Peter , It is the Lord
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.640

Simon Peter therefore hearing that it was the Lord , girded on a Coat
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.641

<paren> for he was naked <$$paren> PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.642

and threw himself into the Sea . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.643

And the other Disciples came in a little Ship
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.644

<paren> for they were not far from Land , but about two_hundred Cubits
off <$$paren> haling the Net of Fishes . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.645

When they therefore arrived at Land , they saw a Coal-fire laid , with
little Fish laid upon <font> it , <$$font> and Bread .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.646

Jesus says to them , Bring some of the little Fishes which you have now
caught . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.647

Simon Peter went up , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.648

and drew the Net to Land , full of great Fish a_hundred_fifty_three ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.649

yet there being so many , the Net was not torn .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.650

Jesus says to them , Come , dine . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.651

How ever none of the Disciples durst enquire of him , Who art thou ?
knowing that it was the Lord . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.652

So Jesus comes , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.653

and takes the Bread , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.654

and gives to them , with the little Fish in like Manner .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.655

This third time now Jesus was made manifest to his Disciples , when he
had been raised up from the Dead . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.656

When they had therefore dined , Jesus asks Simon Peter , Simon of Jonas
, dost thou love me more than these <font> do <$$font> ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.657

He says to him , Yes , Lord , thou knowest that I love thee
affectionately . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.658

He replies to him , Feed my Lambs . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.659

He asks him again the second time , Simon of Jonas , dost thou love me ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.660

He says to him , Yes , Lord , thou knowest that I love thee
affectionately . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.661

He replies to him , Keep my Sheep . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.662

He asks him the third time , Simon of Jonas , dost thou love me
affectionately ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.663

Peter was grieved that he asked him this Question thrice ; whereupon he
said to him , Lord , thou knowest all Things ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.664

thou art sensible that I love thee affectionately .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.665

Jesus replies to him ; Feed my Sheep . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.666

I tell thee very certainly , When thou wast young , thou didst gird thy
self , and walk whither thou wouldest but when thou art old , thou wilt
stretch forth thy Hands , and another will gird , and carry <font> thee
<$$font> whither thou wouldest not . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.667

Now this he said , signifying by what Death he should glorify God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,1J.668

And having spoken this , he says to him , Follow me . <P_21,20J> At
which Peter turning about , sees the Disciple whom Jesus loved following
; who also lay down upon his Breast at Supper , and asked , Lord , who
is it that will deliver thee up ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,20J.669

Peter upon seeing him , enquires of Jesus , Lord , and what of him ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,20J.670

Jesus says to him , If I would have him remain till I come , what is it
to thee ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,20J.671

Do thou follow me . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,20J.672

This Saying therefore went out to the Brethren , that this Disciple
should not die ; whereas Jesus did not say to him , that he should not
die ; but , If I would have him remain till I come , what is it to thee
? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,20J.673

This is the Disciple who testifies concerning these Things , and wrote
them ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,20J.674

and we know that his Testimony is true . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,20J.675

And there are also many other Things all which Jesus did , which if they
should be writ particularly , I think the World it self would not
receive the Books that would be written : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,20J.676

so let it be . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,21,20J.677

Notes upon the Acts of the Apostles . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.680

Chap. I . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.681

<$$heading>

The first Book indeed I made concerning all Things , Theophilus , which
Jesus began both to do and teach ; Till the Day that he was taken up ,
having given command by the Holy Spirit , to the Apostles whom he had
chosen . To whom also he shewed himself alive after he had suffered ,
by many certain Signs , being seen by them for forty Days , and speaking
the Things concerning the Kingdom of God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.683

And being assembled with them , he told them not to depart from
Jerusalem , but to wait for the Father's Promise , which you have heard
from me : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.684

For John indeed baptized with Water , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.685

but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many Days after this
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.686

When they were therefore indeed come together , they asked him as
follows , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.687

Lord , wilt thou restore the Kingdom to Israel at this Time ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.688

And he said to them ; It is not for you to know the Times or
Opportunities , which the Father has put into his own Power .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.689

But you shall receive Ability from the Holy Spirit that shall come upon
you , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.690

and shall be witnesses for me , in Jerusalem , and all Judea , with
Samaria , nay to the End of the Earth . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.691

Having said these Things , while they beheld , he was taken up ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.692

and a Cloud received him away from their Sight .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.693

And as they were looking steadfastly towards Heaven , while he went ,
behold there stood by them two Men in white Apparel ; Who also said ,
Men of Galilee , why do ye stand looking towards Heaven ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.694

The same Jesus that is taken up from you into Heaven , will come in the
same Manner ye saw him go thither . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.695

Then they returned to Jerusalem , from the Mount called Olivet ; which
is near Jerusalem , being thence the Journey of a Sabbath .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.696

And when they were come in , they went up into a Chamber , where there
remained Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas
, Bartholomew , and Matthew , James <font> the Son <$$font> of Alpheaus
, and Simon Zelotes , and Judas <font> the Brother <$$font> of James .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.697

These all continued unanimously in Prayer and Supplication , with the
Women , and Mary the Mother of Jesus , and with his Brothers .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.698

And in those Days Peter standing up in the midst of the Disciples
<paren> the Assembly by Name in the same Place being about
a_hundred_and_twenty {TEXT:font_change_around_"and"} <$$paren> said :
Men , Brethren , it is expedient this Scripture should be fulfilled ,
which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the Mouth of David concerning
Judas , who was the Guide to them that took Jesus .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.699

For he was numbered with us , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.700

and obtained a Lot of this Ministry . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.701

He therefore indeed procured a Field with the Reward of Unrighteousness
; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.702

and falling down headlong , burst in the middle ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.703

and all his Bowels were shed out . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.704

And it was known to all who dwelt at Jerusalem ; forasmuch as that Field
is called in their own Language Akeldama that is The Field of Blood .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,1A.705

<P_1,20A>

For it is written in the Book of Psalms , Let his Habitation be desolate
, and none dwell in it , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,20A.707

and let another take his Office of Over-seer .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,20A.708

It is expedient therefore one of those Men who came together with us ,
all the Time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us , Beginning
from the Baptism of John , to the Day that he was taken up from us ,
should be a Witness of his Resurrection with us .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,20A.709

So they put up two , Joseph called Barsabas , who was surnamed Justus ,
and Matthias . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,20A.710

And praying , said ; Thou Lord , who knowest the Hearts of all , shew
which of these two thou hast chosen , To receive a Lot of this Ministry
and Apostleship , from which Judas transgressed , that he might go to
his own Place . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,20A.711

And they gave their Lots , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,20A.712

when the Lot falling for Matthias , he was numbered along with the
eleven Apostles . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,1,20A.713

<P_2,1A>

<heading>

Chap. II . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.716

<$$heading>

And when the fiftieth Day was fully up , they being all unanimously in
the same Place ; There was suddenly a Sound from Heaven , as of a strong
Blast of Wind blowing along , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.718

and it filled the whole House where they were sitting .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.719

Then there appeared to them Tongues separated as it were of Fire ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.720

and it sat {TEXT:sate} upon each one of them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.721

And they were all full of the Holy Spirit , beginning to speak in other
Tongues , as the Spirit gave them to utter forth .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.722

Now there were Jews dwelt in Jerusalem , <font> who <$$font> were
religious Men , from every Nation under Heaven .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.723

And as there was this Report , a Multitude came together ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.724

and were confounded , because each one heard them speak in his own
Language . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.725

So they were all amazed , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.726

and wondered , saying one to another ; Behold are not all these who
speak Galileans ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.727

How then do we each hear <font> them <$$font> in our own Language ,
among which we were born ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.728

Parthians , and Medes , and Elamites , and such as dwell in Mesopotamia
, with Judea and Cappadocia , Pontus and in Asia , As also Phrygia and
Pamphilia , Egypt and in the Parts of Libya by Cyrene , and Roman
Strangers , with Jews and Proselytes , Cretians and Arabians , we hear
them speak in our Tongues the great Things of God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.729

Thus they were all amazed , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.730

and doubted , saying one to another , What can this be ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.731

Yet others scoffing , said , They are full of new Wine .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.732

But Peter , joined by the eleven , stood up , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.733

and with his Voice exalted solemnly declared to them : Men , Jews , and
all who dwell at Jerusalem , be this known to you ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.734

and give ear to my Words . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.735

For these are not drunk , as you suppose , since it is but the third
Hour of the Day . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.736

But this it is that was spoken by the Prophet Joel ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.737

And in the last Days , says God , I will pour out of my Spirit upon all
Flesh , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.738

and your Sons and Daughters shall prophesy , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.739

your young Men shall see Visions , and your old Men dream Dreams .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.740

Moreover upon my Servant-men and Maids , will I pour out of my Spirit in
those Days , so that they shall prophesy . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.741

Besides I will put Wonders in Heaven above , and Signs upon the Earth
below , Blood , and Fire , and Fume of Smoak .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,1A.742

<P_2,20A>

The Sun shall be turned into Darkness , and the Moon into Blood , before
the great and illustrious Day of the Lord comes .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.744

And every one who calls on the Name of the Lord shall be saved .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.745

Men of Israel , hear these Words : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.746

Jesus the Nazorite , a Man shewn to be from God to you , by the powerful
Things , with the Wonders and Signs , which God did through him amongst
you , as ye your selves also know ; Him , being given forth by the
determined Counsel , and the Foreknowledge of God , ye have taken , and
by unrighteous Hands crucifying , did kill : Whom God has raised up ,
having undone the Pangs of Death ; because it was impossible he should
be held by it . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.747

For David says of him ; I have foreseen the Lord before me continually ;
because he is at my right Hand , that I may not be moved .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.748

For this reason my Heart has been glad , and my Tongue rejoiced ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.749

and moreover my Flesh shall dwell in Hope . Because thou wilt not leave
my Person in the Grave ; nor let thy Holy One see Corruption .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.750

Thou hast made known to me the Ways of Life ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.751

wilt make me full of Joy with thy Presence .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.752

Men , Brethren , let me say to you boldly concerning the Patriarch David
, that he is both dead and buried , and his Sepulchre is among us even
to this Day . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.753

Therefore being a Prophet , and knowing that God had sworn to him with
an Oath , that he would according to the Flesh raise up Christ from the
Fruit of his Body , to sit upon his Throne ; By seeing beforehand , he
spoke concerning the Resurrection of Christ , that his Person was not to
be left in the Grave , nor his Flesh to see Corruption .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.754

This Jesus has God raised up ; of which we all are Witnesses .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.755

As he was therefore exalted by the right Hand of God , and received the
Promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father , he has poured out this
which you now behold and hear . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.756

For David did not ascend into Heaven ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.757

but he says ; The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right Hand , Till I
make thy Enemies thy Foot-stool . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.758

Let all the Family of Israel therefore certainly know , that God has
made this very Jesus , whom you crucified , both the Lord and Christ .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.759

At hearing this , they were pricked to the Heart ; so that they said to
Peter , and the rest of the Apostles , What shall we do , Men , Brethren
? Whereupon Peter said to them ; Repent , and be baptized each of you
in the Name of Jesus Christ , for the Forgiveness of Sins ; and ye will
receive the Gift of the Holy Spirit . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.760

For the Promise is to you , and your Children , nay to all that are far
off , whomsoever the Lord our God shall call hither .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,20A.761

<P_2,40A>

And with many other Words did he testify , and exhort , saying , Be
saved from this forward Generation . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,40A.763

They therefore indeed received his Word gladly ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,40A.764

and were baptized ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,40A.765

so about three_thousand Persons were added that Day . Who continued in
the Doctrine of the Apostles , and in Fellowship , as also in breaking
of Bread , and Prayers . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,40A.766

There was Fear too on every Person , many Wonders and Miracles being
done by the Apostles . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,40A.767

Now all that believed were in the same Place ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,40A.768

and had all Things common . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,40A.769

For they sold <font> their <$$font> Possessions and Goods ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,40A.770

and parted them to all , according as any one had Need .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,40A.771

They also daily continuing unanimously at the Temple , did break Bread
from House to House , and receive the Food in Joy , and Simplicity of
Heart ; Praising God , and having Favour with all the People .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,40A.772

And the Lord added daily those that would be saved to the Church .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,2,40A.773

<P_3,1A>

<heading>

Chap. III . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.776

<$$heading>

At the same Time also Peter and John went up to the Temple , at the Hour
of Prayer , <font> which <$$font> was the ninth .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.778

And a certain Man , being lame from his Mother's Womb , was carried
along , whom they put daily at the Gate of the Temple , called the
beautiful one , to ask for Alms from those that went in to the Temple .
Who when he saw Peter and John about to go in thither , begged Alms .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.779

And Peter looking stedfastly at him , with John , said , Look at us .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.780

So he gave heed to them , waiting to receive Something from them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.781

But Peter said , I have no Silver and Gold : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.782

yet this that I have got I give thee ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.783

by the Name of Jesus the Nazorite rise up , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.784

and walk . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.785

Then he took hold of him by the right Hand , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.786

and raised <font> him <$$font> up ; when immediately his Feet and
Ancle-bones became firm . So that he leaped up , as also stood , and
walked ; nay went in with them to the Temple , walking , leaping , and
praising God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.787

And when all the People saw him walking , and praising God ; They knew
that he was the same , who sat {TEXT:sate} at the beautiful Gate of the
Temple for Alms ; upon which they were full of Astonishment and
Amazement , at what was come to pass on him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.788

For the lame Man who was healed , holding Peter and John ; all the
People ran together to them , at the Porch called Solomon's , being much
astonished . Which Peter seeing , he answered the People : Men of
Israel , why do ye wonder at this ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.789

Or why look you stedfastly at us , as if by our own Power or Piety , we
had made him walk ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.790

The God of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , the God of our Fathers , has
glorified his Son Jesus ; whom you delivered up , and denied him in the
Presence of Pilate , when the same had decreed he should be let go .
Whereas you denied the Holy and Righteous One , and asked for a Murderer
to be given you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.791

But you killed the Prince of Life , whom God has raised up ; of which we
are Witnesses . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.792

And in the Faith of his Name , this Man whom you see and know , his Name
has made firm ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.793

even the Faith which is by himself , has given him this Soundness before
you all . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.794

And now , Brethren , I know that you did <font> it <$$font> through
Ignorance , as also your Rulers . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.795

However the Things which God foretold by the Mouth of all his Prophets ,
that Christ should suffer , he has so fulfilled .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.796

Repent therefore , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.797

and be converted for your Sins to be blotted out ; as the Times of
Refreshment shall come from the Presence of the Lord ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,1A.798

<P_3,20A>

And he shall send Jesus Christ , preached to you before . Whom it is
expedient indeed Heaven should receive , till the Times of the
Restitution of all Things , which God has spoken of by the Mouth of all
his holy Prophets since the World has been .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,20A.800

For Moses indeed said to the Fathers ; The Lord your God will raise you
up a Prophet , from your Brethren , like me ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,20A.801

to him you shall hearken , according to all Things whatever he shall
speak to you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,20A.802

Nay every Person who will not hearken to that Prophet , shall be
destroyed from the People . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,20A.803

And all the Prophets too from Samuel forward , whoever spoke of ,
foretold likewise these Days . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,20A.804

You are the Children of the Prophets , and of the Covenant which God
made with our Fathers , saying to Abraham , And through thy Offspring
shall all the Families of the Earth be blessed .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,3,20A.805

God having raised up his Son Jesus to you first , sent him to bless you
, in turning away each from your Iniquities .

But as they were speaking to the People , the Priests , the Captain of
the Temple , and the Sadducees came upon them ; Being concerned for
their teaching the People , and declaring in Jesus the Resurrection of
the Dead . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.811

So they laid Hands on them , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.812

and put <font> them <$$font> into Custody till the next Day :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.813

for it was now Evening . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.814

Nevertheless many of those who heard the Word believed , the Number of
which Men was become about five_thousand . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.815

And on the next Day gathered together their Rulers , Elders and Scribes
, to Jerusalem ; With Annas the high Priest , Caiaphas , John ,
Alexander , and whoever were of the Kindred of the high Priest .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.816

When setting them in the midst , they asked , By what Power , or by what
Name , have you done this ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.817

Then Peter being full of the Holy Spirit , said to them : Rulers of the
People , and Elders of Israel , If we are examined to_Day about the
Benefit to the infirm Man , by what he is made well ; Let it be known to
you all , and to all the People of Israel , that by the Name of Jesus
Christ the Nazorite , whom you crucified , whom God has raised up from
the Dead , by this he stands here before you sound .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.818

This is the Stone rejected by you Builders , that is become the Head of
the Corner . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.819

And there is not Salvation in any other : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.820

for no other Name under Heaven is given among Men , by which we must be
saved . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.821

Now upon seeing the Boldness of Peter and John , and perceiving that
they were unlearned and unskilful Men , those wondered ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.822

and knew that they had been with Jesus . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.823

When they beheld the Man likewise who was cured standing with them ,
they had Nothing to say against <font> it <$$font> .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.824

However they commanded them to go out of the Council ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.825

and talked one to another as follows ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.826

What shall we do to these Men ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.827

For that indeed a known Miracle has been done by them , is manifest to
all who dwell at Jerusalem , which we can@ @not deny .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.828

But that it may spread no more among the People , let us threaten them
sharply , that they should not henceforth speak to any Man in this Name
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.829

Accordingly they called them , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.830

and ordered them not to speak nor teach at all , in the Name of Jesus .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.831

But Peter and John made answer to them ; Judge you , whether it is
righteous before God , to hearken to you rather than to God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,1A.832

<P_4,20A>

For we can@ @not but speak , what Things we have seen and heard .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.834

At last when they had added Threatenings , they let them go , not at all
finding how they might punish them , by reason of the People ; because
these all glorified God for what was done . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.835

For the Man was above forty Years old , on whom this Miracle of Healing
was done . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.836

Thus being let go , they went to their own <font> Company <$$font> ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.837

and told whatever the chief Priests and Elders had said to them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.838

And those hearing , raised up the Voice unanimously to God ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.839

and said : Lord , thou art God that madest Heaven and Earth , with the
Sea , and all Things which are in them . Who by the Mouth of thy
Servant David didst say ; Why did the Gentiles make a noise , and the
People study vain Things ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.840

The Kings of the Earth stood up , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.841

and the Princes were gathered together in the same Place , against the
Lord and his Christ . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.842

For truly there were gathered together at thy Holy Son Jesus , whom thou
didst anoint , both Herod and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles and
People of Israel , To do whatever thy Hand <font> suffered <$$font> ,
and thy Counsel appointed before , to be done .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.843

So now , O Lord , look on their Threatenings ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.844

and grant to thy Servants that they may speak thy Word with all Boldness
, By stretching forth thy Hand for Healing , and that Miracles and
Wonders may be done , through the Name of thy Holy Son Jesus .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.845

And no sooner had they prayed , but the Place in which they were
gathered together was shaken ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.846

nay they were all full of the Holy Spirit , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.847

and spoke the Word of God with Boldness . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.848

The Multitude also of those who believed , were of one Heart and Soul ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.849

nor did one say that any of the Things he had were his own ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.850

but all Things were common to them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.851

With great Power too did the Apostles render Witness of the Resurrection
of the Lord Jesus ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.852

and there was great Grace on them all . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.853

Neither was there any among them that wanted :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.854

for whoever were Possessors of Lands or Houses , selling , brought the
Prices of the Things sold , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.855

And put at the Feet of the Apostles ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.856

then there {COM:no_associate_to_expletive_"there"} was distributed to
each according as any one had Need . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.857

Thus Joses , surnamed Barnabas by the Apostles <paren> which is , being
interpreted , the Son of Comfort <$$paren> a Levite , by Race from
Cyprus , Selling the Field he had , brought the Money ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.858

and put at the Apostles Feet . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,4,20A.859

<P_5,1A>

<heading>

Chap. V . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.862

<$$heading>

But a certain Man named Ananias , with his Wife Sapphira , sold a
Possession ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.864

And took away some of the Price , his Wife also knowing <font> it
<$$font> , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.865

so brought a certain Part , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.866

and put at the Apostles Feet . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.867

But Peter said ; Ananias , why has Satan filled thy Heart to belye thy
self to the Holy Spirit , and to take away some of the Price of the Land
? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.868

While it remained , did not it remain thine ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.869

and being sold , was in thy Power ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.870

Why didst thou propose this Matter in thy Heart ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.871

Thou hast not lyed to Men , but to God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.872

And when Ananias heard these Words , he fell down ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.873

and expired ; so that there was great Fear on all who heard these Things
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.874

The young Men also arose , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.875

and wound him up , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.876

so carrying out , buried <font> him <$$font> .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.877

Moreover it was about the Space of three Hours , when his Wife , not
knowing what was done , went in . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.878

Upon this Peter demanded of her , Tell me whether you sold the Land for
so much ? Who said , Yes ; for so much . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.879

Then replied Peter to her , Why did you agree to tempt the Spirit of the
Lord ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.880

Behold the Feet of those who buried thy Husband at the Door , and shall
carry thee out . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.881

With that she fell down immediately at his Feet ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.882

and expired ; whom when the young Men went in , they found dead , and
carrying out , buried by her Husband . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.883

So there was great Fear on the whole Church , and on all who heard these
Things . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.884

By the Hands of the Apostles were further done many Miracles and Wonders
among the People ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.885

and they were all unanimously in Solomon's Porch .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.886

But none dared to join with those of the rest ; whereas the People
magnified these . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.887

And Believers were added more to the Lord , Multitudes both of Men and
Women : Insomuch that they carried out the Sick into the Streets , and
laid on Beds and Couches , that even the Shadow of Peter when he came by
might overshadow some of them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.888

And there came together also a Multitude to Jerusalem belonging to the
Cities round about , that carried the Sick , with such as were troubled
by unclean Spirits ; who were all cured . Whereupon the high Priest
rose up , as likewise all that were with him , being the Sect of the
Sadducees , and were so full of Envy , That they laid their Hands on the
Apostles , and put them in publick Custody . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.889

But the Angel of the Lord opened the Doors of the Prison by Night ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,1A.890

and brought them out , as also said , <P_5,20A> Go ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.891

and stand nay speak at the Temple to the People , all the Words of this
Life . Which they hearing , went at Break of Day into the Temple , and
taught : whereas the high Priest coming , and those that were with him ,
they called together the Council , and all the Senate of the Israelites
, then sent to the Jail to have them brought .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.892

But when the Officers came , they did not find them in the Prison ;
whereupon they returned , and told as follows ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.893

We found the Jail indeed shut in all Security , and the Keepers standing
without before the Doors ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.894

yet when we opened <font> it , <$$font> we found Nobody within .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.895

Now as the high Priest , the Captain of the Temple , and the chief
Priests heard these Words , they doubted concerning them , what this
would come to . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.896

In the mean time one came , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.897

and told them thus , Behold the Men whom you put into Prison are
standing in the Temple , and teaching the People .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.898

The Captain then went with the Officers , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.899

and brought them without Violence : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.900

for they were afraid of the People , lest they should be stoned .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.901

And having brought , they set them in the Council , when the high Priest
asked them as follows , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.902

Did not we strictly order you not to teach in this Name ? Whereas
behold you have filled Jerusalem with your Doctrine , and would bring
the Blood of this Man upon us . To which Peter , with the Apostles ,
made answer ; It is fit to obey God rather than Men .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.903

The God of our Fathers raised up Jesus , whom you slew , hanging on a
Tree . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.904

Him has God exalted by his right Hand , <font> for <$$font> a Prince and
Saviour , to give Repentance to Israel , and Forgiveness of Sins .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.905

And we are his Witnesses of these Things , and the Holy Spirit also ,
that God has given to such as obey him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.906

Which they hearing , were so cut , that they consulted to kill them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.907

But there stood up in the Council a certain Pharisee named Gamaliel , a
Teacher of the Law , reputable with all the People ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.908

and when he had commanded the Apostles to be put forth a little while ,
He said to them : Men of Israel , take heed to your selves what ye are
about to do concerning these Men . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.909

For before this Time Theudas rose up , telling that himself was Somebody
, to whom a Number of Men , about four_hundred adhered ; who was killed
, PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.910

and all whoever consented to him were dissolved ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.911

and came to nought . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.912

After him rose up Judas of Galilee , in the Time of Enrolling ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.913

and took away many People after him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.914

and he perished , as likewise all whoever consented to him were
dispersed . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.915

And now I say to you ; Refrain from these Men ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.916

and let them alone : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.917

for if this Counsel or Work is of Men , it will be destroyed ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.918

But if it is of God , you may not destroy it : lest at any time you
should be found Fighters against God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,20A.919

<P_5,40A>

So they consented to him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,40A.921

and calling thither the Apostles , beat <font> them <$$font> ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,40A.922

and ordered they should not speak in the Name of Jesus ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,40A.923

then let them go . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,40A.924

They therefore indeed went rejoicing from the Presence of the Council ,
that they were counted worthy to be disgraced for his Name .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,40A.925

And every Day at the Temple , as also from House to House , they did not
cease to teach and preach Jesus Christ . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,5,40A.926

<P_6,1A>

<heading>

Chap. VI . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.929

<$$heading>

And in that Time , when the Disciples were multiplied , there was a
Murmuring of the Hellenists at the Hebrews , because their Widows were
slighted in the daily Ministring . Upon which the Twelve called the
Multitude of the Disciples thither , and said ; It is not pleasing that
we should leave the Word of God , to minister to Tables .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.931

Therefore , Brethren , look out seven Men among you well testified of ,
full of the Holy Spirit and Wisdom , whom we may appoint over this
Business . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.932

But we will continue in Prayer , and the Ministry of the Word .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.933

And the Speech was pleasing before all the Multitude :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.934

accordingly they chose Stephen , a Man full of Faith and the Holy Spirit
, with Philip , Prochorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas , and Nicolaus a
Proselyte of Antioch . Whom they set before the Apostles ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.935

and these prayed , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.936

and put Hands on them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.937

The Word of God too increased , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.938

and the Number of the Disciples was multiplied exceedingly at Jerusalem
, PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.939

nay a great Company of the Priests was obedient to the Faith .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.940

Besides Stephen being full of Faith and Power , did great Wonders and
Miracles among the People . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.941

Nevertheless there rose up some of the Synagogue called that of the
Libertines , Cyrenians and Alexandrians , with those of Cilicia and Asia
, disputing with Stephen . Whereas they were not able to resist the
Wisdom , and the Spirit with which he spoke .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.942

They then got Men privily who said , We heard him speak blasphemous
Words , in relation to Moses and God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.943

Thus they stirred up the People , Elders and Scribes ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.944

and coming thither , caught him , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.945

and brought into the Council . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.946

Moreover set up false Witnesses who said ; This Man does not cease
speaking blasphemous Words , against this holy Place and the Law .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.947

For we heard him say , that this Jesus the Nazorite would destroy this
Place , and change the Ceremonies which Moses delivered to us .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.948

Now all who sat {TEXT:sate} in the Council looking stedfastly at him ,
saw his Face as if it was that of an Angel . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,6,1A.949

<P_7,1A>

<heading>

Chap. VII . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.952

<$$heading>

However the high Priest asked , Are these Things indeed so ? Whereupon
he said : Men , Brethren and Fathers , hear ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.954

the God of Glory appeared to our Forefather Abraham being in Mesopotamia
, before he dwelt in Charran . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.955

And said to him , Go out of thy Country , and from thy Kindred ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.956

and come to the Country which I will shew thee .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.957

Then going out of the Country of the Chaldeans , he dwelt in Charran ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.958

and from thence , after his Father died , <font> God <$$font> brought
him away into this Country wherein you now dwell .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.959

Yet he gave him no Inheritance in it , nor the Step of a Foot ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.960

but promised to give it to him for a Possession , and to his Posterity
after him , when he had no Child . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.961

God notwithstanding spoke thus , that his Posterity should be Sojourners
in a foreign Country , and those of it would make them Servants , and
treat ill four_hundred Years . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.962

But I will judge the Nation that they shall serve , said God ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.963

and after these Things they shall come out , and worship me in this
Place . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.964

He gave him too the Covenant of Circumcision ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.965

and so he begot Isaac , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.966

and circumcised him the eighth Day ; as Isaac <font> did <$$font> Jacob
, and Jacob the twelve Patriarchs . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.967

And the Patriarchs being envious , sold Joseph into Egypt ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.968

but God was with him : Whom he delivered from all his Afflictions , as
also gave him Favour and Wisdom before Pharaoh King of Egypt ; so that
he made him the chief over Egypt , and his whole House .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.969

Now there came a Famine over the whole Country of Egypt and Canaan ,
with great Affliction , insomuch that our Forefathers did not find Food
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.970

But Jacob hearing there was Corn in Egypt , sent forth our Forefathers
first . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.971

And at the second time Joseph was known by his Brothers ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.972

and Joseph's Kindred were made manifest to Pharaoh .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.973

Next Joseph sent for his Father Jacob , with all his Kindred ,
seventy_five Persons . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.974

Accordingly Jacob went down into Egypt , where he himself died , and our
Fore_fathers . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.975

And these were carried over to Sychem , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.976

and they were put into a Sepulchre , <font> he into <$$font> that which
Abraham bought for a Price of Silver , <font> these into that which
<$$font> was from the Sons of Emmor of Sychem .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.977

But when the Time of the Promise drew near , which God had sworn to
Abraham , the People increased , and multiplied in Egypt ; Till there
rose up another King , who had not known Joseph .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.978

He dealt craftily with our Kindred , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,1A.979

and treated our Forefathers ill ; to make their Infants be cast out ,
that they might not be kept alive . <P_7,20A> In which Time Moses was
born , and was divinely beautiful ; who was nourished in his Father's
House three Months . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.980

And when he was put out , the Daughter of Pharaoh took him up ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.981

and nourished him for her own Son . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.982

Besides Moses was learned in all the Wisdom of the Egyptians ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.983

and was powerful in Words and Works . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.984

But when he was fully arrived at the Age of forty Years , it came into
his Heart to visit his Brethren the Israelites .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.985

And seeing a certain one injured , he defended <font> him <$$font> ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.986

and executed Vengeance for him who was oppressed , smiting the Egyptian
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.987

For he supposed his Brethren would understand , that God would give them
Deliverance by his Hand ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.988

but they did not understand . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.989

The next Day also he appeared to some as they were contending ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.990

and would have compelled them to Peace , saying , Men , you are Brethren
; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.991

why do ye injury one to an other ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.992

Whereas he that did injury to the Neighbour thrust him away , saying ;
Who made thee a Prince and a Judge over us ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.993

Wouldest thou kill me , as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.994

At which Expression Moses fled , and was a Sojourner in the Country of
Madian , where he begot two Sons . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.995

And when the forty Years were compleated , there appeared to him in the
Wilderness of Mount Sina , an Angel of the Lord in a Flame of Fire at a
Bush . Which Moses seeing , wondered at the Sight ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.996

and as he went near to observe , there was the Voice of the Lord to him
, PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.997

I am the God of thy Forefathers , the God of Abraham , and the God of
Isaac , and the God of Jacob : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.998

upon this Moses trembled , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.999

and did not dare to take notice . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.1000

The Lord then said to him ; Undo the Shoes on thy Feet ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.1001

for the Place upon which thou standest is holy Ground .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.1002

I have throughly seen the Affliction of my People who are in Egypt , and
heard their Groaning ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.1003

so I am come down to deliver them : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.1004

come now therefore , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.1005

I will send thee into Egypt . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.1006

This same Moses , whom they denied as follows , Who made thee a Prince
and a Judge ? God sent a Prince and Redeemer , by the Ministry of the
Angel that appeared to him in the Bush . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.1007

He brought them out , doing Wonders and Miracles in the Country of Egypt
, at the Red Sea , and in the Wilderness , forty Years .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.1008

This is the Moses that said to the Israelites , The Lord your God will
raise you up a Prophet , from your Brethren , like me ;

to him do ye hearken . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,20A.1010

This is he that was in the Church in the Wilderness , with the Angel who
spoke to him on Mount Sina , and <font> with <$$font> our Fore fathers ;
he that received the living Oracles to give us . To whom our
Forefathers would not be obedient , but thrust him away , and turned
back in their Hearts to Egypt ; <P_7,40A> Saying to Aaron , Make us gods
that may go before us ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1011

for <font> as to <$$font> this Moses , who brought us out of the Country
of Egypt , we know not what is become of him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1012

And they made a Calf at that Time , as also offered Sacrifice to the
Idol , and rejoiced in the Works of their own Hands . Upon which God
turned back , and delivered them up to worship the Army of Heaven , as
it is written in the Book of the Prophets ; Did you bring slain Beasts
and Sacrifices to me , forty Years in the Wilderness , O Family of
Israel ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1013

But you took up the Tabernacle of Moloch , with Remphan the Star of your
god , Figures which you made to worship them :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1014

so I will carry you away beyond Babylon . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1015

The Tabernacle of Testimony was among our Forefathers in the Wilderness
, as he had ordered , speaking to Moses to make it according to the
Figure that he had seen . Which also our Forefathers received , and
brought with Jesus into the Possession of the Gentiles , whom God drove
out from the Presence of our Forefathers , till the Time of David . Who
was in Favour before God , and desired to find a Tabernacle for the God
of Jacob . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1016

But Solomon built him a House . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1017

Nevertheless the Highest does not dwell in Temples made with Hands ,
according as the Prophet says ; Heaven is a Throne to me , and the Earth
my Footstool ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1018

what House will you build for me ? says the Lord :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1019

or which is the Place of my Rest ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1020

Has not my Hand made all these ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1021

O Stiff-necked ones , and of uncircumcised Heart and Ears , you always
resist the Holy Spirit ; even you like your Forefathers .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1022

Which of the Prophets did not your Forefathers persecute ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1023

Nay they killed those who foretold concerning the Coming of the
Righteous One , of whom now you have been the Betrayers and Murderers :
You that received the Law at the Appointments of Angels , yet have not
kept <font> it <$$font> . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1024

And upon hearing these Things , they were cut to their Hearts ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1025

and gnashed the Teeth at him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1026

But he being full of the Holy Spirit , looked stedfastly to Heaven ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1027

and saw the Glory of God , with Jesus standing at God's right Hand .
Whereupon he said , Behold I see the Heavens opened , and the Man
standing at the right Hand of God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1028

Then they cried out aloud , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1029

and stopped their Ears , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1030

so unanimously ran with violence upon him . Whom they put forth without
the City , and stoned ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1031

and the Witnesses laid down their Cloaths at the Feet of a young Man
called Saul . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1032

Thus they stoned Stephen who was calling on , and saying , Lord Jesus ,
receive my Spirit . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,40A.1033

<P_7,60A>

He also kneeled down , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,60A.1035

and cried out aloud , Lord , do not lay this Sin to them ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,60A.1036

and having said this , he went to sleep . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,7,60A.1037

<P_8,1A>

Chap. VIII . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1040

<$$heading>

And Saul was consenting to his Death : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1042

there was likewise at that Time a great Persecution against the Church
at Jerusalem ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1043

and they were all dispersed throughout the Countries of Judea and
Samaria , besides the Apostles . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1044

Moreover the religious Men carried away Stephen ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1045

and made great Lamentation over him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1046

And Saul laid waste the Church , as he went in from House to House ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1047

and haling Men and Women , committed <font> them <$$font> to Prison .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1048

They therefore indeed that were dispersed , went about preaching the
Word . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1049

So Philip going down to the City of Samaria , preached Christ to them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1050

And a Multitude gave heed unanimously to the Things that were spoken by
Philip , through hearing them , and beholding the Miracles which he did
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1051

For out of many who had unclean Spirits they came , crying out aloud ;
as likewise many that had the Palsy , and who were lame , were cured :
Insomuch that there was great Joy in that City .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1052

But there was a certain Man named Simon , who had been before using
Magick in the City , and amazed the Nation of Samaria , telling that
himself was some great one . To whom they all gave heed from the least
to the greatest , saying , He is the great Power of God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1053

And they gave heed , to him , because he had a great while made them
amazed with Magick . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1054

But when they believed Philip , as he preached the Things concerning the
Kingdom of God , and the Name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized both
Men and Women . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1055

Nay Simon himself also believed , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1056

and was baptized , continuing with Philip ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1057

and when he saw the powerful Things and Miracles that were done , he was
amazed . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1058

And the Apostles who were at Jerusalem , hearing that Samaria had
received the Word of God , sent to them Peter and John . Who went down
, and prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Spirit .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1059

For he was yet fallen upon none of them , they being only baptized in
the Name of the Lord Jesus . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1060

Then these put Hands upon them , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1061

and they received the Holy Spirit . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1062

And when Simon perceived that the Holy Spirit was given by putting on of
the Apostles Hands , he offered them Money ; Saying , Give me also this
Power , that on whomsoever I put Hands , he may receive the Holy Spirit
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,1A.1063

<P_8,20A>

But Peter said to him ; Let thy Silver be for Destruction with thee ,
because thou hast supposed that the Gift of God might be procured by
Money . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1065

Thou hast neither Part nor Lot in this Matter ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1066

for thy Heart is not right before God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1067

Therefore repent of this Wickedness of thine ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1068

and pray to God , if indeed the Thought of thy Heart will be forgiven
thee . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1069

For I see thou art in the Gall of Bitterness , and Bond of
Unrighteousness . To which Simon made answer , Pray you to the Lord for
me , that none of the Things which you speak may come upon me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1070

They therefore indeed having testified , and spoken the Word of the Lord
, returned to Jerusalem , preaching to many Villages of the Samaritans .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1071

And an Angel of the Lord spoke thus to Philip , Rise up ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1072

and go towards the South ; to the Way going down from Jerusalem to Gaza
, which is Wilderness . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1073

So he rose up , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1074

and went ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1075

and behold an Ethiopian Man , a powerful Eunuch of Candace Queen of the
Ethiopians , that was over all her Treasure , who had come to worship at
Jerusalem ; Was returning , and sitting in his Chariot ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1076

and read in the Prophet Esaias . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1077

And the Spirit said to Philip , Go near ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1078

and join with this Chariot . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1079

Accordingly Philip ran thither , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1080

and when he heard him reading in the Prophet Esaias , he said , Dost
thou know what thou readest ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1081

And he said , How indeed can I , if Nobody guides me ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1082

So he besought Philip , that he would come up to sit with him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1083

Now the Passage of Scripture which he read was this ; Like a Sheep was
he brought to the Slaughter , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1084

and was dumb like a Lamb before him who shears it ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1085

so he did not open his Mouth . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1086

His Judgment was taken away in his Humiliation ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1087

but who can tell his Generation , though his Life is taken from the
Earth ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1088

And the Eunuch made answer to Philip , I pray thee , of whom does the
Prophet speak this ? of himself , or of some other ? Upon which Philip
opened his Mouth , and beginning at this Scripture , preached Jesus to
him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1089

At length as they went on the Way , they came to some Water ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1090

and the Eunuch said , Here is Water , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1091

what hinders me from being baptized ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1092

If thou believest from the whole Heart , said Philip , thou mayest .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1093

And he made answer , I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God .
Whereupon he commanded the Chariot to stand still ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1094

then both Philip and the Eunuch went down each into the Water ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1095

and he baptized him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1096

But when they were come up out of the Water , the Spirit of the Lord
caught away Philip , so that the Eunuch saw him no more ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1097

for he went his Way rejoicing . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,20A.1098

<P_8,40A>

However Philip was found at Azotus ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,40A.1100

and going through , he preached at all the Cities , till he came to
Cesarea . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,8,40A.1101

<P_9,1A>

<heading>

Chap. IX . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1104

<$$heading>

And Saul yet breathing out Threatenings and Slaughter at the Disciples
of the Lord , went to the high Priest ; Of whom he requested Letters for
Damascus to the Synagogues , that if he found any who were of this Way ,
whether Men or Women , he might bring them bound to Jerusalem .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1106

And as he was going , when he came near Damascus , there suddenly shone
about him a Light from Heaven . Whereupon he fell on the Earth , and
heard a Voice say to him , Saul , Saul , why dost thou persecute me ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1107

And he asked , who art thou , Lord ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1108

And the Lord said , I am Jesus , whom thou persecutest ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1109

it is hard for thee to kick at the Stings . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1110

Then he trembled , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1111

and astonished as he was , said , Lord , what wilt thou have me do ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1112

And the Lord said to him , Arise , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1113

and go into the City , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1114

and it shall be told thee what thou shouldest do .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1115

The Men also that traveled with him stood speechless , hearing indeed a
Voice , but seeing Nobody . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1116

So Saul rose up from the Ground , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1117

and when his Eyes were opened , he saw no Person ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1118

and him leading by the Hand , they brought to Damascus .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1119

Thus was he three Days without seeing , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1120

and did neither eat nor drink . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1121

Now there was a certain Disciple at Damascus named Ananias , to whom the
Lord said in a Vision , Ananias ; who said , Here am I , Lord . And the
Lord to him ; Arise , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1122

go into the Street called Straight , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1123

and seek at the House of Judas for one named Saul of Tarsus :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1124

for behold he is praying ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1125

And has seen in a Vision a Man named Ananias , coming in , and putting
the Hand on him , that he might have sight .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1126

To which Ananias answered , Lord , I have heard from many concerning
this Man , how many Evils he has done to thy Saints at Jerusalem .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1127

Here too he has power from the chief Priests , to bind all who call on
thy Name . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1128

But the Lord said to him ; Go , because he is a chosen Vessel to me , to
bear my Name before the Gentiles and Kings , as well as the Israelites .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1129

For I will shew him how many Things he must suffer for my Name .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1130

Accordingly Ananias went , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1131

and entered into the House , as also put Hands on him ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1132

and said , Brother Saul , the Lord has sent me , Jesus who appeared to
thee in the Way wherein thou camest , that thou mayest have sight , and
be filled with the Holy Spirit . Upon which there presently fell from
his Eyes as it were Scales , and he had sight immediately ; so rose up ,
and was baptized . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1133

And when he had received Food , he was strengthened .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1134

Afterwards Saul was with the Disciples at Damascus some Days .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,1A.1135

<P_9,20A>

He then presently preached Christ in the Synagogues , that he is the Son
of God . So that all who heard were amazed , and said , Is not this he
that destroyed such as called on this Name at Jerusalem , and came
hither for the same , that he might bring them bound to the chief
Priests ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1137

And Saul became more strong , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1138

and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus , proving that this is
Christ . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1139

But when many Days were compleated , the Jews consulted together to kill
him . Whereas their laying in wait was not unknown to Saul ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1140

and they watched the Gates Day and Night , that they might kill him .
Whom the Disciples took at Night , and let down by the Wall in a Basket
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1141

At length Saul came to Jerusalem , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1142

and tried to join with the Disciples ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1143

but they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a Disciple .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1144

However Barnabas taking hold of him , introduced <font> him <$$font> to
the Apostles , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1145

and told them how he had seen the Lord in the Way , and that the same
had spoken to him , and also how he had declared boldly at Damascus in
the Name of Jesus . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1146

Hereupon he was with them , going in and out at Jerusalem .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1147

Nay he both declared boldly in the Name of the Lord Jesus ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1148

and disputed against the Hellenists ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1149

but they attempted to kill him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1150

This when the Brethren knew , they had him away to Cesarea ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1151

and sent him forth to Tarsus . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1152

The Churches therefore indeed , throughout all Judea , Galilee and
Samaria , had Peace , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1153

and were built up ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1154

nay going on in the Fear of the Lord , and Comfort of the Holy Spirit ,
were multiplied . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1155

And Peter going through them all , went down likewise to the Saints that
dwelt at Lydda . Where he found a certain Man named Eneas , who had
lain in Bed eight Years , having the Palsy ; To whom Peter said , Eneas
, Jesus Christ heals thee : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1156

arise , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1157

and make thy own Bed ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1158

whereupon he arose presently . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1159

And all that dwelt at Lydda , and Saron , saw him , who were converted
to the Lord . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1160

At Joppa too there was a certain Disciple named Tabitha , which being
interpreted is called Roe ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1161

she was full of good Works and Alms , which she did .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1162

And at that Time being sick , she died ; whom they washed , and put in a
Chamber . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1163

Now as Lydda was near Joppa , the Disciples heard that Peter was in that
Place , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1164

so they sent two Men to him , beseeching he would not delay to come over
to them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1165

And Peter rising up , went with them ; whom when he was come , they
brought into the Chamber : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1166

and all the Widows stood by him weeping , and shewing the Coats and
Garments , how many Roe made when she was with them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,20A.1167

<P_9,40A>

But Peter putting them all forth , kneeled down ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,40A.1169

and prayed ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,40A.1170

then turned to the Body , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,40A.1171

and said , Tabitha , arise : where upon she opened her Eyes , and seeing
Peter , sat {TEXT:sate} up . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,40A.1172

And he gave her the Hand , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,40A.1173

and raised her up ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,40A.1174

then calling the Saints and Widows , he presented her alive . Which was
known throughout all Joppa , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,40A.1175

and many believed in the Lord . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,40A.1176

He afterwards remained many Days at Joppa , with one Simon a Tanner .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,9,40A.1177

<P_10,1A>

<heading>

Chap. X . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1180

<$$heading>

And there was a certain Man at Cesarea named Cornelius , a Centurion of
the Regiment called the Italian ; Who was pious , and feared God with
all his Family , as also bestowed many Alms on the People , and prayed
to God always . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1182

He saw in a Vision manifestly , about the ninth Hour of the Day , an
Angel of God come in to him , and say to him , Cornelius . On whom he
looked stedfastly , and being frightened , said , What is it , Lord ?
Who answered him ; Thy Prayers and Alms are come up into Remembrance
before God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1183

So now send Men to Joppa , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1184

and send for Simon , who is surnamed Peter .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1185

He lodges with one Simon a Tanner , whose House is by the Sea ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1186

he will tell thee what thou shouldest do . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1187

Accordingly when the Angel who spoke to Cornelius was gone , he called
two of his Servants , and a pious Soldier of those that continued with
him , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1188

And after he had declared all to them , he sent them to Joppa .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1189

Now the next Day as they took the journey , and came near the City ,
Peter went up on the House-top to pray , about the sixth Hour .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1190

And he was very hungry , so that he would have eat ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1191

but while they prepared , a Trance fell upon him . When he saw Heaven
opened , and a Vessel coming down to him , like a great Sheet tied at
the four Ends , and let down to the Earth ; In which were all Manner of
four-footed Creatures of the Earth , wild Beasts . creeping Things ,
and Fowls of the Air . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1192

And there was a Voice to him , Rise up , Peter ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1193

slay , and eat . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1194

But Peter said , By no means , Lord ; since I have never eat any Thing
common or unclean : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1195

However the Voice was to him again the second time , What God has
cleansed , do not thou reckon common . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1196

This too was done thrice , and the Vessel taken up again into Heaven .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1197

And as Peter doubted in himself what the Vision which he had seen was ,
behold the Men sent from Cornelius , having made enquiry for Simon's
House , were come to the Gate . Who calling , asked if Simon surnamed
Peter lodged there . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1198

While Peter was thinking about the Vision , the Spirit said to him ;
Behold three Men seek for thee . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,1A.1199

<P_10,20A>

So rise up , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1201

and go down , as also go with them , being in no doubt , because I have
sent them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1202

Peter then went down to the Men sent to him from Cornelius ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1203

and said , Behold I am he whom you seek after ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1204

what is the Cause for which you are come hither ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1205

And they answered , Cornelius the Centurion , a Man righteous , and
fearing God , as likewise well testified of by the whole Nation of the
Jews , has been divinely admonished by a holy Angel , to send for thee
to his House and to hear Words from thee .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1206

He therefore called them in PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1207

and lodged ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1208

so the next Day Peter went away with them ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1209

and some Brethren from Joppa accompanied him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1210

The next Day also they got into Cesarea ; whom Cornelius was expecting ,
and had called together his Relations , and intimate Friends .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1211

And as Peter was going in , Cornelius met him ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1212

and falling down at his Feet , reverenced .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1213

But Peter raised him up , saying , Arise ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1214

I my self too am a Man . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1215

Thus when he had talked with him , he went in ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1216

and found many come together . To whom he said ; You know how it is
unlawful for a Man <font> that <$$font> is a Jew , to join with , or go
to one of another Nation ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1217

but God has shewn me , that I should call no Man common or unclean .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1218

Therefore without contradicting I came , on being sent for :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1219

I ask then for what Intent you have sent for me ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1220

And Cornelius answered : Four Days ago I was fasting till this Hour ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1221

and at the ninth Hour was praying in my House , when behold there stood
a Man before me in bright Apparel : Who said ; Cornelius , thy Prayer is
hearkened to , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1222

and thy Alms are remembred before God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1223

Send therefore to Joppa , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1224

and call for Simon , that is surnamed Peter :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1225

he lodges in the House of Simon the Tanner , by the Sea , who will come
, and speak to thee . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1226

At the same Time therefore I sent to thee ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1227

and thou hast done well in coming : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1228

now therefore we are all come hither before God , to hear all Things
given in command to thee by God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1229

Then Peter opened the Mouth , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1230

and said : Truly I perceive that God is not a Respecter of Persons .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1231

But in every Nation he who fears him , and works Righteousness , is
accepted by him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1232

The Word which he sent to the Israelites , preaching Peace by Jesus
Christ , who is Lord of all , You know ; the Matter done through all
Judea , begun from Galilee , after the Baptism that John preached : How
God anointed Jesus of Nazareth , with the Holy Spirit and Power , who
went about doing good , and healing all that were overpowered by the
Devil ; because God was with him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1233

And we are Witnesses of all that he did , both in the Country of the
Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they killed , hanging on a Tree .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,20A.1234

<P_10,40A>

Him God raised up the third Day , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,40A.1236

and caused him to be made manifest ; Not to all the People , but to
Witnesses appointed before by God , to us who did eat and drink with him
, after he rose up from the Dead . When he ordered us to preach to the
People , and to testify , that it is he who was determined by God , for
the Judge of the Living and Dead . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,40A.1237

For relating to him all the Prophets testify , that all who believe on
him , will receive Forgiveness of Sins through his Name .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,40A.1238

While Peter was speaking these Words , the Holy Spirit fell upon all
that heard the Word . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,40A.1239

And the Believers who were of the Circumcision , as many as came with
Peter , were amazed , that the Gift of the Holy Spirit was also shed out
on the Gentiles . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,40A.1240

For they heard them speak in Languages , and magnify God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,40A.1241

Then Peter on this occasion said , Can any forbid Water , that these
should not be baptized , who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we
? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,40A.1242

So he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,40A.1243

Then they intreated him to stay some Days .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,10,40A.1244

<P_11,1A>

<heading>

Chap. XI . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1247

<$$heading>

Now the Apostles and Brethren who were in Judea , heard that the
Gentiles had also received the Word of God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1249

And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem , they who were of the
Circumcision debated with him , Saying , Thou hast gone in to Men that
are uncircumcised , and eat with them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1250

But Peter begun , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1251

and expounded <font> it <$$font> to them successively on as follows :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1252

I was at the City of Joppa praying ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1253

and saw a Vision in a Trance , some Vessel coming down , like a great
Sheet let down by the four Ends from Heaven ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1254

and it came quite to me . On which looking stedfastly , I observed ,
and saw four-footed Creatures of the Earth , wild Beasts , creeping
Things , and Fowls of the Air . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1255

And I heard a Voice say to me , Rise up , Peter ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1256

slay , and eat . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1257

But I said , By no means , Lord ; since any Thing common or unclean has
never entered into my Mouth . Whereas the Voice answered me the second
time from Heaven , What God has cleansed , do not thou reckon common .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1258

This too was done thrice , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1259

and all were pulled up again into Heaven . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1260

And behold at the same Time three Men were come to the House in which I
was , who were sent from Cesarea to me . When the Spirit said I should
go with them , and be in no doubt . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1261

So there accompanied me also these six Brethren ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1262

and we entered into the Man's House . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1263

Then he told us how he had seen an Angel in his House , who stood , and
said to him ; send Men to Joppa , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1264

and send for Simon surnamed Peter : Who will speak Matters to thee , by
which thou shalt be saved , and all thy Family .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1265

And when I began to speak , the Holy Spirit fell upon them , the same as
upon us at the Beginning . Whereupon I remembred the Saying of the Lord
, how he declared , John indeed baptized with Water ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1266

but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1267

If therefore God gave them the like Gift as to us , that believed on the
Lord Jesus Christ , who was I to be able to hinder God ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1268

And upon hearing these Things , they were silent ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1269

and glorified God , saying , Then to the Gentiles also God has given
Repentance for Life . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1270

Those moreover indeed that were dispersed by the Trouble made concerning
Stephen , went about to Phenice , Cyprus and Antioch ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1271

yet declared the Word to Nobody , excepting the Jews only .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,1A.1272

<P_11,20A>

However some of them were Men of Cyprus and Cyrene , who went into
Antioch , and spoke to the Hellenists , preaching the Lord Jesus .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,20A.1274

The Hand of the Lord also was with them ; so that a great Number
believed , and were converted to the Lord .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,20A.1275

And when Word was heard in the Ears of the Church at Jerusalem
concerning these Things , they sent forth Barnabas to go to Antioch .
Who came , and rejoiced at seeing the Grace of God ; and exhorted them
all to abide firm to the Lord with Purpose of Heart : Since he was a
good Man , and full of the Holy Spirit and Faith ; so that a great
Company was added to the Lord . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,20A.1276

Afterwards Barnabas went away to Tarsus , to look for Saul .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,20A.1277

And having found him , he brought him to Antioch : when they assembled
together a whole Year among the Church , and taught a great Company ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,20A.1278

and the Disciples were first named Christians at Antioch .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,20A.1279

At this Time likewise there went down Prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch
. One of whom named Agabus rose up , and signified by the Spirit ,
there would be after that a great Famine in the whole World ; which also
came to pass under Claudius Cesar . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,20A.1280

So the Disciples , according as any one was able , determined each of
them to send , for the Service of the Brethren who dwelt in Judea .
Which accordingly they did , sending to the Elders by the Hand of
Barnabas and Saul . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,11,20A.1281

<P_12,1A>

<heading>

Chap. XII . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1284

<$$heading>

Moreover at that Time King Herod laid on Hands , to treat ill some of
the Church . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1286

Nay he killed James , the Brother of John , with a Sword .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1287

And seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews , he proceeded also to take
Peter ; then being the Days of unleavened Bread . Whom he likewise
apprehended , and put into Prison , nay delivered to four Parcels of
Soldiers to keep him , intending to bring him forth to the People after
the Passover . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1288

Peter therefore indeed was kept in Prison ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1289

but there was earnest Prayer made by the Church , to God for him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1290

And when Herod was about to bring him out , that Night Peter was
sleeping between two Soldiers , bound with two Chains ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1291

and the Keepers before the Door kept the Prison .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1292

Then behold an Angel of the Lord came there ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1293

and a Light shone in the Room ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1294

he also smote Peter on the Side , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1295

and raised him up , saying , Arise quickly ; upon which his Chains fell
from the Hands . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1296

And the Angel said to him , Gird thy self , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1297

and tie on thy Sandals ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1298

and he did so : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1299

next he said to him , Put on thy Garment , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1300

and follow me . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1301

Accordingly he went out , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1302

and followed him , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1303

yet did not know that it was true which was done by the Angel ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1304

but thought he beheld a Vision . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1305

So going through the first and second Prison , they came to the iron
Gate that brings into the City , which opened to them of it self ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1306

and going out , they went along one Street , when presently the Angel
departed from him . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1307

At length Peter came to himself , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1308

and said , Now I know truly that the Lord has sent forth his Angel , and
delivered me from the Hand of Herod , and all the Expectation of the
Jewish People . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1309

This being sensible of , he came to the House of Mary , the Mother of
John surnamed Mark , where many were got together , and praying .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1310

And Peter knocking at the Door of the Gate , a young Woman went near to
listen , named Rhoda . Who knew Peter's Voice , and did not open the
Gate for Joy ; but ran in , and told that Peter stood before the Gate .
Whereas they said to her , Thou art mad ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1311

but she affirmed it was so ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1312

then said they , It is his Angel . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1313

In the mean time Peter remained knocking ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1314

and when they opened , they saw him , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1315

and were amazed . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1316

But he beckoning to them with the Hand to hold their peace , told them
how the Lord had brought him out of the Prison ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1317

and said , Declare these Things to James and the Brethren ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1318

then going out , he went to another Place .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1319

Thus when it was Day , there was not a little Bustle among the Soldiers
, about what was become of Peter . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1320

And as Herod sought for him , without finding , upon examining the
Keepers , he commanded they should be taken away ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1321

afterwards he went down from Judea to Cesarea ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1322

and abode <font> there <$$font> . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,1A.1323

<P_12,20A>

Herod also was exasperated at the Tyrians and Sidonians ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20A.1325

but they came thither to him unanimously , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20A.1326

and persuading Blastus the King's Chamberlain , they desired Peace ,
because their Country was nourished by that of the King .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20A.1327

And on an appointed Day , Herod cloathed with royal Apparel , and
sitting on the Judgment-seat , made an Oration to them . Upon which the
People bawled out , The Voice of God , and not of Man .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20A.1328

And immediately the Angel of the Lord smote him , because he did not
give Glory to God ; so that being eat by Worms , he expired .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20A.1329

But the Word of God increased and multiplied .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20A.1330

Besides Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem , when they had
fulfilled the Service , taking with them also John surnamed Mark .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,12,20A.1331

<P_13,1A>

<heading>

Chap. XIII . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1334

<$$heading>

Now there were in the Church that was at Antioch , some Prophets and
Teachers , namely Barnabas , Simeon called Niger , Lucius of Cyrene ,
Manaen <font> who <$$font> was brought up with Herod the Tetrarch , and
Saul . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1336

And they ministring to the Lord , and fasting , the Holy Spirit said ,
Separate now for me Barnabas and Saul , to the Work that I have called
them to . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1337

Then after they had fasted , prayed , and put Hands on them , they let
<font> them <$$font> go . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1338

They therefore indeed being sent forth by the Holy Spirit , went down to
Seleucia , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1339

and from thence sailed away to Cyprus . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1340

And when they were at Salamis , they declared the Word of God in the
Synagogues of the Jews ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1341

and they also had John for an Attendant . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1342

Thus as they went through the Isle to Paphos , they found a certain
Magician , a false Prophet , <font> that <$$font> was a Jew , whose Name
was Barjesus . Who was with the Deputy Sergius Paul , an understanding
Man : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1343

the latter calling thither . Barnabas and Saul , desired to hear the
Word of God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1344

But Elymas the Magician <paren> for so his Name is interpreted <$$paren>
withstood them , endeavouring to pervert the Deputy from the Faith .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1345

Upon this Saul , who is also Paul , being full of the Holy Spirit ,
looked stedfastly at him , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1346

And said ; O thou full of all Deceit and all Mischief , Son of the Devil
, Enemy of all Righteousness , wilt thou not cease perverting the right
Ways of the Lord ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1347

So now behold the Hand of the Lord is upon thee , insomuch that thou
shalt be blind , not beholding the Sun for a Time : when immediately
there fell on him a Mist and Darkness , and he going about , sought for
some who would lead <font> him <$$font> by the hand .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1348

Then the Deputy seeing what was done , believed ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1349

and was surprized at the Doctrine of the Lord .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1350

Afterwards those about Paul went off from Paphos ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1351

and came to Perga of Pamphylia ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1352

but John departed from them , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1353

and returned to Jerusalem . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1354

Next they went along from Perga PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1355

and came to Antioch of Pisidia ; where they entered into the Synagogue
on the Sabbathday , and sat {TEXT:sate} down .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1356

And after the Reading of the Law and Prophets , the Rulers of the
Synagogue sent Word to them , Men , Brethren , if there is the Word of
Exhortation in you to the People , speak . Whereupon Paul rose up , and
beckoning with the Hand , said : Men of Israel , and you that fear God ,
hear . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1357

The God of this People Israel chose our Forefathers ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1358

and exalted the People at the Sojourning in the Country of Egypt ,
bringing them out of it by a high Arm . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1359

About the Time of forty Years also , he bore their Manners in the
Wilderness . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,1A.1360

And when he had overthrown seven Nations in the Country of Chanaan , he
gave their Country to them by lot . <P_13,20A> As likewise after these
Things , he gave Judges as it were four_hundred_and_fifty Years , till
Samuel the Prophet . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1361

And afterwards they asked a King , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1362

and God gave them Saul the Son of Cis , a Man of the Tribe of Benjamin
forty Years . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1363

When he removed him , and raised up to them David for a King , for whom
also testifying , he said , I have found David of Jesse , a Man
according to my Mind , who will do all my Will . From whose Offspring
God , according to the Promise , has raised up to Israel the Saviour
Jesus . John having preached , before the Appearance of his Coming ,
the Baptism of Repentance to all the People of Israel .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1364

And as John fulfilled the Course , he said , Whom do you imagine me to
be ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1365

I am not <font> he <$$font> ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1366

but behold he comes after me , the Shoes of whose Feet I am not worthy
to undo . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1367

Men , Brethren , Sons of the Race of Abraham , and those among you who
fear God , to you is the Word of this Salvation sent .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1368

For they that dwell at Jerusalem , and their Rulers , being ignorant of
him , and the Voices of the Prophets read on every Sabbath , by
condemning <font> him <$$font> , have fulfilled <font> these <$$font> .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1369

Nay though they found no Cause of Death , they desired Pilate that he
might be killed . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1370

And when they had accomplished all Things that were written of him ,
they took down from the Tree , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1371

and put <font> him <$$font> into a Grave .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1372

Nevertheless God raised him up from the Dead . Who appeared for many
Days , to such as went up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem ; that are
his Witnesses to the People . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1373

And we preach to you , that the Promise made to the Forefathers , God
has fulfilled to us their Children , by raising up Jesus ; as it is also
written in the second Psalm , Thou art my Son ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1374

to_Day have I begotten thee . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1375

And that he raised him up from the Dead , for him no more afterwards to
return to Corruption , he said thus , I will give you the sure holy
Things of David . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1376

Therefore he also says in another Place , Thou wilt not let thy Holy One
see Corruption . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1377

For David indeed , when he had ministred to his own Generation by the
Counsel of God , went to sleep , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1378

and was put to his Fathers , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1379

so saw Corruption . Whereas he whom God raised up did not see
Corruption . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1380

Be it therefore known to you , Men , Brethren , that Forgiveness of Sins
through him is declared to you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1381

And from all Things that you could not be justified by the Law of Moses
, every one who believes is justified by him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,20A.1382

<P_13,40A>

Look therefore , lest there should come upon you what is spoken in the
Prophets , Behold , O Despisers , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1384

and be astonished , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1385

and vanish away : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1386

for I perform a Work in your Days , that you will not at all believe ,
though any one should tell you . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1387

Now though the Jews departed out of the Synagogue , the Gentiles
besought those Words might be spoken to them on the next Sabbath .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1388

And after the Assembly was dissolved , many of the Jews and religious
Proselytes , followed Paul and Barnabas ; who speaking to them ,
persuaded them to remain in the Grace of God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1389

On the Sabbath also that was coming almost all the City gathered
together to hear the Word of God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1390

But when the Jews saw the Multitudes , they were full of Envy ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1391

and spoke against the Things said by Paul , contradicting and
blaspheming . Upon which Paul and Barnabas speaking boldly , said ; It
was necessary that the Word of God should be spoken first to you ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1392

but since you put it away , and do not judge your selves worthy of
everlasting Life , behold we turn to the Gentiles .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1393

For so the Lord has commanded us , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1394

I have put thee for the Light of the Gentiles , that thou mightest be
for Salvation to the End of the Earth . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1395

Which the Gentiles hearing , rejoiced , and extolled the Word of the
Lord ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1396

and whoever were appointed for everlasting Life believed .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1397

Moreover the Word of the Lord was carried about through the whole
Country . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1398

However the Jews set on the religious and honourable Women , with the
principal Men of the City , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1399

and stirred up such a Persecution against Paul and Barnabas , that they
expelled them from their Borders . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1400

But these shook off the Dust of their Feet at them ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1401

and came to Iconium . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1402

Besides the Disciples were full of Joy , and the Holy Spirit .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,13,40A.1403

<P_14,1A>

<heading>

Chap. XIV . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1406

<$$heading>

And at Iconium in like Manner they went into the Synagogue of the Jews ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1408

and so spoke , that a great Multitude both of the Jews and Grecians
believed . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1409

Yet the unbelieving Jews stirred up , and made the Minds of the Gentiles
ill against the Brethren . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1410

A great while therefore indeed they abode , speaking boldly in the Lord
, who testified for the Word of his Grace , and granted Miracles and
Wonders to be done by their Hands . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1411

Thus the Multitude of the City was divided ; some indeed being with the
Jews , and some with the Apostles . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1412

And when there was an Assault both of the Gentiles and Jews , with their
Rulers , to abuse and stone them ; They knowing <font> it <$$font> ,
fled to the Cities of Lycaonia , Lystra and Derbe , and the Region round
about : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1413

And they were there preaching . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1414

Now a certain Man sat {TEXT:sate} at Lystra , that was impotent in the
Feet , being lame from his Mother's Womb , who had never walked .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1415

He heard Paul speaking ; who looking stedfastly on him , and seeing that
he had Faith to be healed , Said aloud , Stand up straight on thy Feet ;
whereupon he leaped , and walked . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1416

Then the Multitude seeing what Paul had done , raised up their Voice ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1417

and said in the Lycaonian Language , Gods who are like Men are come down
to us . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1418

So indeed they called Barnabas Jupiter ; and Paul Mercury , since he was
the chief in Speech . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1419

Besides the Priest of Jupiter who was before their City , brought Oxen
and Garlands to the Gate , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1420

and would have sacrificed with the Multitude . Which when the Apostles
, Barnabas and Paul heard , they tore their Cloaths asunder , and rushed
into the Company , crying out , And saying ; Men , why do ye these
Things ? When we are Persons affected like you , and preach that ye may
be turned from these Vanities to the Living God , who made Heaven ,
Earth , the Sea , and all Things that are in them . Who in Ages past
let all the Gentiles go in their own Ways .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1421

Although he did not leave himself without Witness , as he did good ,
giving us Rain from Heaven , and fruitful Seasons , so filled our Hearts
both with Food and Joy . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1422

And on saying these Things , they scarce made the Multitude rest , not
to sacrifice to them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1423

But there came Jews from Antioch and Iconium , who when they had
persuaded the Multitude , stoned Paul , and haled <font> him <$$font>
without the City , supposing he was dead . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,1A.1424

<P_14,20A>

Nevertheless while the Disciples compassed him about , he rose up ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20A.1426

and went into the City ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20A.1427

the next Day also he went away with Barnabas to Derbe . To which City
they preached , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20A.1428

and having taught many , returned to Lystra , Iconium and Antioch ;
Confirming the Souls of the Disciples , exhorting to continue in the
Faith , and that through many Afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom
of God . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20A.1429

Having chosen them Elders also throughout the Church , and prayed with
Fasting , they committed them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20A.1430

Next they went through Pisidia , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20A.1431

and came to Pamphylia ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20A.1432

Moreover declaring the Word at Perga , they went down to Attalia .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20A.1433

And from thence they sailed away to Antioch , whence they had been
delivered to the Grace of God , for the Work which they fulfilled .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20A.1434

When they were thus come , and had gathered together the Church , they
rehearsed whatever God had done with them , and that he had opened a
Door of Faith to the Gentiles . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20A.1435

And they abode there not a little while with the Disciples .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,14,20A.1436

<P_15,1A>

<heading>

Chap. XV . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1439

<$$heading>

In the mean time some came down from Judea ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1441

and taught the Brethren , If you are not circumcised according to the
Ceremony of Moses , you can@ @not be saved .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1442

Not a little Dissension and Disputing being therefore made , by Paul and
Barnabas , against these ; <font> the Brethren <$$font> appointed Paul
and Barnabas , with some others of them , to go up to the Apostles and
Elders at Jerusalem , about this Question .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1443

Therefore they indeed being conducted by the Church , went through
Phenice and Samaria , telling the Conversion of the Gentiles ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1444

and caused great Joy to all the Brethren . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1445

Coming then to Jerusalem , they were received by the Church , including
the Apostles , and Elders ; when they rehearsed whatever God had done
with them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1446

But there rose up some of the Sect of the Pharisees who believed ,
saying that it was needful to circumcise them , and to order they should
keep the Law of Moses . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1447

So the Apostles and Elders gathered together , to see about this Matter
. PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1448

At length when there had been much Disputing , Peter rose up ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1449

and said to them : Men , Brethren , you know that a long while ago God
chose , that among us the Gentiles should hear the Word of the Gospel by
my Mouth , and believe . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1450

And God who knows the Hearts testified for them , by giving them the
Holy Spirit , according as also to us . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1451

Nay he made no Difference between us and them , as he cleansed their
Hearts by Faith . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1452

Now therefore why do ye tempt God , by putting a Yoke upon the Neck of
the Disciples , which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1453

But we believe we shall be saved by the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ ,
in the same Manner as also they <font> will . <$$font>
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1454

Next all the Multitude held their peace , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1455

and heard Barnabas and Paul declare , whatever Miracles and Wonders ,
God had done among the Gentiles by them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1456

And after they had held their peace , James made answer : Men , Brethren
, hear me . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1457

Simeon has declared how God first visited , to take from the Gentiles a
People for his Name . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1458

And to this agree the Words of the Prophets , as it is written ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1459

After these Things I will return , and build again the Tabernacle of
David which is fallen down ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1460

will build again its Breaches , and raise it up : That the Remainder of
Men may seek after the Lord , and all the Gentiles who are called by my
Name , says the Lord , the Doer of all these Things .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1461

Known by God are all his Works since the World has been .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,1A.1462

Therefore I judge they should not be disturbed , who from the Gentiles
are turned to God ; <P_15,20A> But that they should be written to , for
them to refrain from the Pollutions of Idols , Whoredom , Things
strangled and Blood . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1463

For Moses from ancient Ages has had such as preach him throughout the
City , being read in the Synagogues on every Sabbath .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1464

Then it seemed well to the Apostles and Elders , with the whole Church ,
to send chosen Men of themselves , Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas ,
chief Men among the Brethren , to Antioch , with Paul and Barnabas ;
Writing by their Hands these Things : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1465

The Apostles , Elders and Brethren , salute the Brethren who are of the
Gentiles at Antioch , Syria and Cilicia . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1466

Whereas we have heard , that some who went out from us have troubled you
with Words , and subverted your Souls , saying you should be circumcised
, and keep the Law ; whom we did not command : It seemed well to us ,
being together unanimously , to send chosen Men to you , with our
beloved Barnabas and Paul ; Persons who have delivered up their Lives ,
for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1467

We have therefore sent Judas and Silas , who will tell these Things by
Word . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1468

For it seemed well to the Holy Spirit and us , to put on you no more
Burden than these necessary Things ; To refrain <font> from <$$font>
Things offered to Idols , Blood , Things strangled and Whoredom : from
which preserving your selves , you will do well .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1469

Farewel . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1470

They therefore indeed being sent away , came to Antioch ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1471

and when they had gathered together the Multitude , gave the Epistle .
Which these read , and rejoiced for the Comfort .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1472

Moreover Judas and Silas , as they were also Prophets themselves ,
exhorted the Brethren by many Words , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1473

and confirmed . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1474

After they had done thus a while , they were sent away with Peace , from
the Brethren to the Apostles . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1475

Nevertheless it seemed well to Silas to stay there .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1476

Paul likewise and Barnabas abode at Antioch , teaching and preaching ,
with many others besides , the Word of the Lord .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1477

However some Days after Paul said to Barnabas , Let us return now to
look how our Brethren do , throughout every City in which we have
declared the Word of the Lord . Whereupon Barnabas consulted to take
with <font> them <$$font> John called Mark .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1478

But Paul did not count him worthy to be taken with <font> them <$$font>
, who went away from them at Pamphylia , and did not go with them to the
Work . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1479

There was therefore such Provocation made , that they departed asunder
one from another ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1480

and Barnabas taking Mark , sailed away to Cyprus .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,20A.1481

<P_15,40A>

Paul also chose Silas , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,40A.1483

and went away , being delivered to the Grace of God by the Brethren .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,40A.1484

Afterwards he went through Syria and Cilicia , confirming the Churches .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,15,40A.1485

<P_16,1A>

<heading>

Chap. XVI . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1488

<$$heading>

Then he came to Derbe and Lystra , where behold was a certain Disciple
named Timothy , the Son of some Jewish Woman <font> that <$$font> was a
Believer , but the Father a Grecian . Who was well testified of by the
Brethren , at Lystra and Iconium . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1490

Him Paul would have go out with himself , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1491

so took , and circumcised him , by reason of the Jews who were in those
Places : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1492

for they all knew that his Father was a Grecian .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1493

And as they passed through the Cities , they delivered to them the
Orders , decreed by the Apostles and Elders at Jerusalem , to keep .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1494

The Churches were therefore indeed confirmed in the Faith ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1495

and were more in Number daily . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1496

Now going through Phrygia , and the Country of Galatia , they were
forbid by the Holy Spirit to speak the Word in Asia .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1497

When they came against Mysia , they tried to go to Bithynia ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1498

but the Spirit would not let them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1499

So they passed by Mysia , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1500

and went down to Troas . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1501

And a Vision appeared to Paul by Night : PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1502

there was a certain Man of Macedonia stood beseeching him in this manner
, PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1503

Come over to Macedonia , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1504

and help us . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1505

And when he had seen the Vision , we presently sought to go to Macedonia
, having proof that the Lord called us thither to preach to them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1506

Therefore going off from Troas , we sailed directly to Samothrace , and
the next <font> Day <$$font> to Neapolis ; As also from thence to
Philippi , which is the principal City of Part of Macedonia , a Colony ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1507

and we were in that City abiding some Days .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1508

And on the Sabbath-day we went out of the City by the River , where
Prayer used to be ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1509

and when we had sat {TEXT:sate} down , we spoke to the Women who were
come together . Which a certain Woman heard , named Lydia , a Seller of
Purple of the City of Thyatira , that worshipped God ; whose Heart the
Lord opened , to give heed to the Things spoken by Paul .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1510

And when she was baptized , with her Houshold , she besought as follows
, PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1511

If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my House ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1512

and remain ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1513

thus she constrained us . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1514

As we were going <font> to <$$font> Prayer , a certain young Woman that
had a Spirit of Divination met us ; who by foretelling <font> Things
<$$font> , yielded much Gain to her Masters .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1515

She followed after Paul and us , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1516

and thus cried out , These Men are Servants of the Highest God , who
declare to us the Way of Salvation . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1517

And this she did for many Days ; so that Paul being concerned , turned
about , and said to the Spirit , I order thee in the Name of Jesus
Christ , to come out of her ; which he did the same Hour .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1518

Thus her Masters seeing that the Hope of their Gain was gone , they took
hold of Paul and Silas , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1519

and dragged <font> them <$$font> into the Marketplace to the Rulers .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,1A.1520

<P_16,20A>

Next they brought them to the Magistrates ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1522

and said ; These Men , who are Jews , exceedingly trouble our City ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1523

And declare Ceremonies , which it is not lawful for us to receive , nor
to do , being Romans . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1524

Whereupon the Company rose up together against them ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1525

and the Magistrates tearing off their Cloaths , commanded they should be
whipt . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1526

So they laid many Stripes on them , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1527

and cast <font> them <$$font> into Prison , ordering the Jailor to keep
them safely . Who as he received such an Order {TEXT:Ordre} cast them
into the inner Prison , and made their Feet fast in the Stocks .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1528

But about Midnight Paul and Silas prayed , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1529

and sung praise to God ; so that the Prisoners heard them . When
suddenly there was a great Earth_quake , insomuch that the Foundations
of the Jail were shaken ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1530

nay all the Doors were immediately <font> opened <$$font> , and the
Bonds of all let loose . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1531

Upon this the Jailor being awakened , and seeing the Doors of the Prison
open , drew the Sword , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1532

and was about to kill himself , as he supposed that the Prisoners were
fled out . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1533

But Paul called aloud , saying , Do no Harm to thy self ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1534

for we are all here . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1535

He then asking for a Light , rushed in , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1536

and trembling as he was , fell down to Paul and Silas ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1537

And when he had brought them out ; he said , Sirs , what must I do that
I may be saved ? To which they answered , Believe on the Lord Jesus
Christ ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1538

so thou shalt be saved , and thy Houshold .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1539

Moreover they spoke to him the Word of the Lord , and to all in his
House . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1540

And he took them the same Hour of the Night ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1541

and washed over the Stripes ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1542

then was he baptized , and all his immediately .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1543

Bringing them also into his House , he laid on the Table for <font> them
<$$font> ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1544

and was joyful with all the Houshold , believing in God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1545

Besides when it was Day the Magistrates sent the Serjeants to say , Let
those Men go . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1546

And the Jailor told these Words to Paul , The Magistrates have sent that
you should be let go ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1547

now therefore depart , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1548

and go in Peace . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1549

But Paul said to them , They beat us publickly uncondemned , though we
were Roman Men , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1550

and cast <font> us <$$font> into Prison ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1551

and now would they privately put us forth ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1552

No indeed ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1553

but let them come themselves , and fetch us out .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1554

And the Sergeants rehearsed these Words to the Magistrates , who hearing
that they were Romans , were afraid . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1555

So they came , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1556

and besought them ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1557

and bringing <font> them <$$font> out , intreated they would go out of
the City . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,20A.1558

<P_16,40A>

Thus they came out of the Prison , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,40A.1560

and went into Lydia's ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,16,40A.1561

and seing the Brethren , they comforted them ,

Afterwards travelling through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to
Thessalonica , where there was a Synagogue of the Jews .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1568

And Paul according to the Custom went in to them ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1569

and on three Sabbaths discoursed with them from the Scriptures ; Opening
and alleging , that it was needful for Christ to suffer , and rise up
from the Dead , so that this , whom I declare to you , is Christ Jesus .
Upon which some of them were persuaded , and associated with Paul and
Silas , as likewise of the religious Grecians a great Multitude , nay of
the principal Women not a few . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1570

Yet the unbelieving Jews being envious , took some wicked Men of the
base ones , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1571

and when they had got a Company , made a tumult in the City ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1572

and coming to Jason's House , sought to bring them to the People .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1573

But as they did not find them , they haled Jason , and some Brethren to
the Governors of the City , crying out ; These that make disturbance in
the World , are also come hither : Whom Jason has received in ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1574

and these all do contrary to the Orders of Cesar , saying that there is
another King , <font> who <$$font> is Jesus .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1575

Thus they troubled the Company , and the Governors of the City who heard
these Things . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1576

However taking what was sufficient from Jason and the rest , they let
them go . Whereupon the Brethren presently sent forth Paul , and Silas
, by Night to Berea ; who when they came , went into the Synagogue of
the Jews . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1577

And these were more noble than they at Thessalonica , being such as
received the Word with all Readiness of Mind , and examined the
Scriptures daily , whether these Things were so .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1578

Many of them therefore indeed believed , as also of honourable Grecian
Women , and Men not a few . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1579

But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the Word of God was
likewise declared by Paul at Berea , they came thither too , stirring up
the Multitude . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1580

And then the Brethren presently sent forth Paul , to go as it were to
the Sea ; PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1581

but both Silas and Timothy abode there . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1582

Now those who conducted Paul , brought him to Athens ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1583

and having received a Command for Silas and Timothy , that these should
come to him as soon as possible , they departed .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1584

And while Paul was waiting for them at Athens , his Spirit was provoked
in him , upon seeing the City was addicted to Idols .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1585

Therefore indeed he discoursed in the Synagogue , with the Jews and
those that were religious , as likewise in the Market-place on every Day
to such as met <font> him . <$$font> Upon which some of the Epicurean
and Stoick Philosophers talked to him , and some said , What will this
Babbler prate ? And certain , He seems to be a Declarer of strange
Demons ; because he preached to them Jesus and the Resurrection .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1586

So they took hold of him , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1587

and brought <font> him <$$font> to the Areopagus , saying ; May we know
what is this new Doctrine spoken by thee ? PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,1A.1588

<P_17,20A>

For thou bringest some strange Things to our Hearing :
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1590

we would therefore know what these may be . Since all the Athenians ,
and Strangers <font> who <$$font> were Lodgers , spent the Time in
Nothing else , but to tell and hear some new Thing .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1591

Then Paul standing in the middle of the Areopagus , said : Men of Athens
, I see you are too superstitious in all Things .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1592

For as I went along , and considered your Things that are worshipped , I
found an Altar upon which there was written , To the unknown God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1593

Him therefore whom you unknowingly worship , I declare to you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1594

God who made the World , and all Things in it , he being Lord of Heaven
and Earth , does not dwell in Temples made with Hands .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1595

Nor is he served by the Hands of Men , as being in want of any Thing ;
since he gives to all Life , Breath , and all Things . And has made
every Nation of Men of the same Blood , to dwell on all the Surface of
the Earth , determining the Times appointed before , and the Bounds of
their Dwelling . For them to seek the Lord , if indeed they may feel
him , and find ; although he is not far from each one of us .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1596

For in him we live , move and are ; as some of the Poets also with you
have said , For we are also his Offspring .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1597

Being therefore the Offspring of God , we ought not to suppose that the
Deity is like Gold , Silver or Stone , carved by the Art and Thought of
Man . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1598

The Times indeed therefore of Ignorance God having looked over , now
orders all Men every where to repent . Because he has appointed a Day
on which he will hereafter judge the World in Righteousness , by the Man
whom he has determined ; having yielded Belief to all , in raising him
up from the Dead . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1599

But when they heard of the Resurrection of the Dead , some indeed
scoffed , PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1600

and some said , We will hear thee again concerning this .
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1601

And so Paul went away from amongst them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1602

Notwithstanding certain Men joined with him ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1603

and believed ;
{COM:head_of_relative_clause_is_subject_of_previous_token} among whom
also was Dionysius the Areopagite , as likewise a Woman named Damaris ,
and others with them . PURVER-NEW-1764-2,17,20A.1604
