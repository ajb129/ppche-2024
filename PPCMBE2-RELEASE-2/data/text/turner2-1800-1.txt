<$$heading>

We had no sooner entered the apartments allotted for our accommodation ,
than messages of compliment and congratulation were received , both from
the Regent , Chanjoo Cooshoo , brother of the late Lama , and Soopoon
Choomboo , his cup-bearer , accompanied by a white silk scarf from each
. TURNER2-1800-1,232.47

These attentions were quickly followed by a most ample supply of
refreshments ; large vessels of warm tea , parched grain , dried fruits
, and various articles of provision . TURNER2-1800-1,232.48

Such are the forms observed , both here and in Bootan , towards a
visitor , upon his first arrival : TURNER2-1800-1,232.49

and perhaps a weary traveller would agree with me , in thinking it a
most rational mode of reception , which thus bounteously places at his
feet , after the toil of a long journey , every thing that hunger and
fatigue render necessary to his relief . TURNER2-1800-1,232.50

Ceremonious visits , on the first day , are always dispensed with ;
TURNER2-1800-1,232.51

and the stranger is left to seek refreshment and rest , without
interruption . TURNER2-1800-1,232.52

I did not omit to return , by the messenger , who waited upon me ,
proper acknowledgments for the polite attentions of the Regent , and
Soopoon Choomboo ; TURNER2-1800-1,232.53

I sent at the same time , a white silk scarf to each ;
TURNER2-1800-1,232.54

for this is an offering invariably attendant on every intercourse of
ceremony , as well in Tibet as in Bootan . TURNER2-1800-1,232.55

A similar piece of silk is always transmitted under cover , with letters
, even from the most distant places , whether they be merely
complimentary , or relate to <P_233> public business of importance ;
TURNER2-1800-1,233.56

and indeed between people of every rank and station in life , the
presenting a silk scarf , constantly forms an essential part of the
ceremonial of salutation . TURNER2-1800-1,233.57

If persons of equal rank meet , an exchange takes place :
TURNER2-1800-1,233.58

if a superior is approached , he holds out his hand to receive the scarf
, TURNER2-1800-1,233.59

and a similar one is thrown across the shoulders of the inferior by the
hand of an attendant , at the moment of his dismission .
TURNER2-1800-1,233.60

The colour that is employed on this occasion , is either white , or
crimson ; TURNER2-1800-1,233.61

but the latter is least frequently used , white appearing to have an
universal preference . TURNER2-1800-1,233.62

This manufacture is of a thin texture , resembling that sort of Chinese
stuff called pelong , TURNER2-1800-1,233.63

and is remarkable for the purity of its glossy whiteness .
TURNER2-1800-1,233.64

They are commonly damasked , TURNER2-1800-1,233.65

and the sacred words , <font> Oom maunee paimee oom <$$font> , are
usually interwoven near both ends , which terminate in a fringe .
TURNER2-1800-1,233.66

They differ materially in size and quality , TURNER2-1800-1,233.67

and are commonly proportioned , by him who presents , to his own
condition , and the degree of respect he means to pay his guest .
TURNER2-1800-1,233.68

Trivial and unmeaning as this custom may appear to Europeans , long and
general practice has here attached to it the highest importance .
TURNER2-1800-1,233.69

I could obtain no determinate information as to its meaning or origin ,
TURNER2-1800-1,233.70

but I find that it has indeed a most extensive prevalence .
TURNER2-1800-1,233.71

It is observed , as I have before noticed , in all the territory of the
Daeb Raja ; TURNER2-1800-1,233.72

it obtains throughout Tibet ; TURNER2-1800-1,233.73

it extends from Turkistan to the confines of the Great Desert ;
TURNER2-1800-1,233.74

it is practised in China , TURNER2-1800-1,233.75

and , I doubt not , reaches to the limits of Mantchieux Tartary .
TURNER2-1800-1,233.76

I view it merely in the light of an emblem of friendship , and a pledge
of amity . TURNER2-1800-1,233.77

In the course of my travels , every person who visited me , observed
this mode of salutation ; TURNER2-1800-1,233.78

and as we were among a people not <P_234> very conversant with the
various customs of different nations , and who probably would have
considered , any obvious deviation from their own , in no very
favourable point of view , I never hesitated , when waiting upon the
Chief , to salute him in his own way . TURNER2-1800-1,234.79

The letters I received in Tibet and Bootan , were constantly accompanied
by a pelong scarf , TURNER2-1800-1,234.80

and , in conformity with the custom , I always sent one in return .
TURNER2-1800-1,234.81

Of so much moment indeed , in their estimation is the observance of this
formality , that Mr. Goodlad , the Resident at Rungpore , informed me ,
that the Raja of Bootan , once returned to him a letter he had forwarded
from the Governor_General , merely because it came unattended with this
bulky incumbrance , to testify its authenticity . TURNER2-1800-1,234.82

We passed this day with little or no interruption , in a high degree
sensible of the superior comfort of a warm and solid habitation , over
thin and airy tents . TURNER2-1800-1,234.83

The season was already becoming , to the sensations of a people who had
not long quitted the tropics , most keenly cold ; TURNER2-1800-1,234.84

and the quiet and retirement we now enjoyed , afforded us a comfortable
relief from the fatigue and restlessness of mind , produced by the
bustle of a long and rapid journey . TURNER2-1800-1,234.85

Our habitation was found , upon examination , greatly to exceed our
expectations . TURNER2-1800-1,234.86

The rooms were commodious , and even elegant ; TURNER2-1800-1,234.87

and the arrangement of every thing was as convenient as could possibly
be wished . TURNER2-1800-1,234.88

We occupied a part of the palace of the latest structure , which had
been built by the late Teshoo Lama , for his private residence .
TURNER2-1800-1,234.89

We had already been abundantly supplied , with all that could satisfy
the calls of our immediate wants . TURNER2-1800-1,234.90

Servants belonging to the Regent's household were appointed to attend me
, not only in the <P_235> capacity of messengers , to be sent on any
service abroad , but also to assist in domestic business ;
TURNER2-1800-1,235.91

and these friendly tokens of the good disposition entertained towards us
, could not but fill our minds with satisfaction , and intimate the most
auspicious presage respecting the event of my mission .
TURNER2-1800-1,235.92

Towards the close of the evening , I received a visit from the person
who had been sent to meet me by the Regent , while I resided in Bootan .
TURNER2-1800-1,235.93

His appearance and manners were extremely conciliating .
TURNER2-1800-1,235.94

The features of the Tibetian {COM:sic_here_and_passim} , which are in
general high and harsh , were in him , softened by a cheerful ,
intelligent , and placid expression of countenance .
TURNER2-1800-1,235.95

I could not but conceive the strongest prepossessions in his favour ;
TURNER2-1800-1,235.96

nor did any conduct of his , that I ever witnessed , cause me , in the
slightest degree , to alter that good opinion . TURNER2-1800-1,235.97

As long as he continued in the monastery , his attentions were
unremitted , TURNER2-1800-1,235.98

and few days passed , in which he did not spend some hours with me .
TURNER2-1800-1,235.99

He was my instructor in the language of Tibet ; TURNER2-1800-1,235.100

and , when tired with the repetition of guttural and nasal sounds , of
which I found this language in a great degree to consist , he would ,
with the utmost cheerfulness , accept my challenge to a trial of skill
at chess ; in which , though I sometimes came off victorious , I was
rather disposed to attribute my success to his urbanity , than to my own
superior play . TURNER2-1800-1,235.101

The station and movement of every piece , I found to be the same ;
TURNER2-1800-1,235.102

and the game was conducted by the same rules , which regulate our play
in England . TURNER2-1800-1,235.103

These visits continued regularly , until he was summoned to a distant
part of Tibet on the public service . TURNER2-1800-1,235.104

I felt in his departure , the loss of an agreeable companion and an
useful instructor , TURNER2-1800-1,235.105

and we really parted , <P_236> I believe , with mutual reluctance ,
which on his part only yielded to a sense of duty .
TURNER2-1800-1,236.106

Early in the morning after our arrival , intimation was brought to me ,
that the Regent proposed , in the course of the morning , to admit us to
an audience . TURNER2-1800-1,236.107

Several messages passed between us , before the appointed time , for the
purpose of arranging every thing completely in due form .
TURNER2-1800-1,236.108

At length , about noon , Mr. Saunders and myself , accompanied by
Poorungheer , as interpreter , proceeded to a part of the palace , with
which , though it was at a considerable distance from our rooms , there
was a communication , without descending into the street .
TURNER2-1800-1,236.109

We were then ushered into the presence chamber , a large and lofty hall
, of an oblong shape , surrounded with a colonnade , and enlightened by
an opening , over the centre . TURNER2-1800-1,236.110

This central part of the room , contained an area , about twice as wide
as the distance at which the pillars stood from the side walls .
TURNER2-1800-1,236.111

Light , air , and the grateful warmth of the sun , were occasionally
admitted into the hall , by shifting the screen {TEXT:skreen} , or
rather moveable roof , which was placed immediately over the opening .
TURNER2-1800-1,236.112

The pillars that composed the colonnade were painted with vermilion ,
and richly ornamented with gold , as were also the edges of the
scolloped {COM:sic} arches , and the mouldings over them ;
TURNER2-1800-1,236.113

various symbolical devices were also represented in the gilding above
the arches . TURNER2-1800-1,236.114

The walls were painted blue , skirted by two broad fillets of red , and
an intermediate one of yellow . TURNER2-1800-1,236.115

The floor was of a mottled composition , apparently of brown and white
flint , intermixed with some strong compost , which admitted a high
polish . TURNER2-1800-1,236.116

No window , or door , opened into this hall , except that by which we
entered , at one end ; TURNER2-1800-1,236.117

at the <P_237> other , immediately opposite , stood the throne of the
late Teshoo Lama , placed in a recess , elevated about five feet above
the floor , surmounted with cushions of yellow satin , and decorated
with hangings on each side , of various coloured silks , and rich
brocades . TURNER2-1800-1,237.118

At the foot of the throne were thin tapers , of the composition which
they burn as incense in their temples , and vases filled with aromatic
woods , which , consuming slowly , with their smoke powerfully perfumed
the hall . TURNER2-1800-1,237.119

From this seat , we were informed the Teshoo Lama was accustomed to
distribute justice , and confer his solemn benediction upon the people .
TURNER2-1800-1,237.120

Advancing to the upper end of the hall , we found the Regent , and
Soopoon Choomboo , each of them habited in the religious dress , and
seated under the colonnade , upon the left_hand side of the throne , on
elevated seats raised with satin cushions . TURNER2-1800-1,237.121

White silk scarfs , according to the established custom of the country ,
were presented by us , which they received without quitting their seats
. TURNER2-1800-1,237.122

I then delivered the Governor_General's dispatches into the Regent's
hands , with a string of pearl and coral , whilst the rest of the
presents were placed before him . TURNER2-1800-1,237.123

Two raised seats of cushions had been prepared , towards which the
Regent waving his hand , with a very significant look , directed us to
be seated . TURNER2-1800-1,237.124

I then thought it proper to address him nearly to the following effect .
TURNER2-1800-1,237.125

" The few things I have the honour of offering to your acceptance , the
Governor_General , Mr. Hastings , has sent to you as tokens of his
friendship and esteem , and with an earnest solicitude to preserve and
cultivate the amicable intercourse , that had so happily commenced
between you . TURNER2-1800-1,237.126

This correspondence , in its earliest stages , had been <P_238> dictated
by the purest motives of humanity , TURNER2-1800-1,238.127

and has hitherto pointed with unexampled sincerity and steadiness
towards one great object , which constituted the grand business of Maha
Gooroo's life , peace and universal good . TURNER2-1800-1,238.128

The Governor_General , whose attention is always directed towards the
same pursuits , was overwhelmed with anxiety , upon hearing the mournful
news of the loss of his respected friend ; not only on account of his
regret for the departure of so exalted a character , but from an
apprehension , lest the friendship established between himself and you ,
might suffer interruption , and undergo a change .
TURNER2-1800-1,238.129

Yet , solicitous for its continuance , as soon as information was
brought to him of your return from China , he determined that a person
in his confidence should repair to your presence ; a measure , which the
consoling character of a friend loudly demanded , and which was rendered
still more necessary , by his desire to convey his earliest
congratulations , upon the joyful tidings of the Lama's re-appearance in
the world . TURNER2-1800-1,238.130

In this great event , indeed , all his hopes are now revived ;
TURNER2-1800-1,238.131

and , persuaded that the present Lama possesses the spirit of his former
friend , he has no doubt that , by your good offices , and the will of
heaven , every thing that was expected , will at length be effectually
accomplished . " TURNER2-1800-1,238.132

The Regent replied , by assuring me that the present and the late Teshoo
Lama , were one and the same , and that there was no manner of
difference between them ; TURNER2-1800-1,238.133

only as he was yet merely an infant , his spirit having but just
returned again into the world , <P_239> he was at present incapable of
action , and unable to comfort them with his voice .
TURNER2-1800-1,239.134

Their thoughts and time , therefore , were solely employed in the care
of his person <paren> for this was their duty and delight <$$paren> , in
the hope that he might be soon able to confer upon them his blessing .
TURNER2-1800-1,239.135

At the same time that he lamented the misfortune of the Lama's decease
in Pekin , he assured me of the firm unshaken attachment which Teshoo
Lama had entertained for Mr. Hastings , to his latest breath .
TURNER2-1800-1,239.136

He added that Maha Gooroo had even begun to open his mind to the Emperor
of China upon this subject , confident of his sanction and encouragement
of the connection , and trusting that the concord mutually established
between them , would extend its beneficial influence over all his
votaries , and all the subjects of both empires .
TURNER2-1800-1,239.137

He then dwelt upon the great attention and respect paid to Teshoo Lama
at the court of China ; TURNER2-1800-1,239.138

and told me that the Emperor , immediately on his receiving intelligence
of the Lama's regeneration , had sent ambassadors with letters of
congratulation , and a rosary of large unblemished pearls , enjoining
them in the strongest terms to be careful of the Lama's person , to
conduct his education in the strictest privacy , and not to suffer any
strangers to be admitted to his presence . TURNER2-1800-1,239.139

But I must forbear entering into a minute detail of every particular
that passed at our different interviews . TURNER2-1800-1,239.140

It would be difficult , or rather perhaps impossible , to preserve the
local idiom , and turn of expression , in a translation through two
languages ; TURNER2-1800-1,239.141

and I am not certain even that my interpreter repeated them correctly in
the Hindovi , which was the language that he used to me .
TURNER2-1800-1,239.142

Suffice it at present to say , that the Regent was most copious in his
professions of attachment to the <P_240> Governor_General , and loud in
his encomiums on the occasion that gave birth to their present
friendship , which originated entirely in his granting peace to the
Booteeas , who were engaged with us in a very unequal war , in
compliance with the intercession of Teshoo Lama .
TURNER2-1800-1,240.143

This act he declared to be <font> bole durm <$$font> , or of the
greatest virtue . TURNER2-1800-1,240.144

Soopoon Choomboo also occasionally spoke . TURNER2-1800-1,240.145

Inquiries respecting Mr. Hastings , the satisfaction they derived from
the receipt of his dispatches , my journey , the difficulties that had
impeded it , and their solicitude to see me , were topics which occupied
a considerable share of our time in this conference .
TURNER2-1800-1,240.146

Much was also said respecting the sad calamity they had suffered by the
Lama's having withdrawn himself from the world , in consequence of their
offences ; TURNER2-1800-1,240.147

nor did they omit strongly to express their sense of the blessing , that
he had been pleased to appear again so early in the flesh .
TURNER2-1800-1,240.148

I was informed , that the infant Lama still continued to reside in the
dwelling , where he was first discovered , in the valley of Painom ; but
that it was proposed to convey him within a few days to Terpaling , a
monastery prepared for his reception , near the summit of a mountain at
the distance of two days journey from Teshoo Loomboo ; and that all the
court , were to attend his removal . TURNER2-1800-1,240.149

All the time of the principal officers of state was nearly occupied in
preparations for this event , TURNER2-1800-1,240.150

and the Regent gave me to understand , that he had , in consequence ,
but little leisure , and might possibly , not have it in his power to
see me again more than once , before his departure .
TURNER2-1800-1,240.151

Near the close of the audience , tea was introduced , and served up in
the same manner as in Bootan . TURNER2-1800-1,240.152

We had small benches placed before us , TURNER2-1800-1,240.153

and upon them <P_241> was set the same kind of cup , which , I remember
, the Daeb Raja told me , in his dominions , none but the Raja , or one
of the three Lamas , could presume to use . TURNER2-1800-1,241.154

This I notice , not only as being one among their sumptuary laws , but
also as an evidence of their disposition to manifest very high respect ,
as well as civility , in their attentions to us .
TURNER2-1800-1,241.155

In shape and size this cup is somewhat similar to a China pint bason ;
TURNER2-1800-1,241.156

but a round hollow pedestal proceeds from beneath , sufficiently long ,
to be grasped within the hand , and upon which it will stand upright
without support . TURNER2-1800-1,241.157

It is made of the finest porcelain , extremely thin , and purely white ,
TURNER2-1800-1,241.158

and is stamped on both sides with the impression of the dragon , the
imperial emblem , which is visible only , like the water mark in bank
paper , on close inspection , at a small distance .
TURNER2-1800-1,241.159

Previously to our taking leave , trays of tea , sugar , skins of butter
, and dried fruits , consisting of raisins , dates , apricots , and
almonds , with some others that I had never before seen , the produce of
China and eastern Tartary , were severally presented to us .
TURNER2-1800-1,241.160

The Regent gave me many injunctions to communicate all my wants to the
person , whom he had directed to attend upon us .
TURNER2-1800-1,241.161

We each received a scarf from his own hands , TURNER2-1800-1,241.162

and withdrew , having every reason to be gratified with our reception ,
which I considered as attentive , and flattering , in the highest degree
. TURNER2-1800-1,241.163

I will now endeavour to give some idea of the Regent's person and manner
. TURNER2-1800-1,241.164

In stature he was of the middle size , rather of a broad make , but not
inclined to corpulency . TURNER2-1800-1,241.165

He had a short wide face , with the nose a little turned up , small
black eyes , and high cheek bones . TURNER2-1800-1,241.166

Though he was by no means handsome , yet there was an agreeable <P_242>
symmetry in his features , and a sweetness of expression in his
countenance , which was highly prepossessing . TURNER2-1800-1,242.167

His language was plain and unaffected , neither inflated with the
exuberancy of Asiatic diction , nor yet deficient in urbanity ;
TURNER2-1800-1,242.168

it was delivered with that mild unassuming manner , which strongly
characterises Tibetians of good education . TURNER2-1800-1,242.169

His action was void of gesticulation ; TURNER2-1800-1,242.170

it consisted in a slight movement of the body forwards , and a bending
of the neck , assisted by the variations of an expressive and
enlightened countenance ; TURNER2-1800-1,242.171

his arms were almost constantly folded beneath his mantle .
TURNER2-1800-1,242.172

His voice appeared to be injured by the loss of his teeth , which
occasioned , I thought , rather an indistinct articulation ,
TURNER2-1800-1,242.173

or perhaps this effect might in some degree be produced by a defect in
the roof of the mouth . TURNER2-1800-1,242.174

My interpreter , however , had no difficulty in understanding him , as
he spoke slowly , and commanded a ready choice of words ;
TURNER2-1800-1,242.175

his dress was that of the religious order , which seems to be the
regular habit of every attendant on the court . TURNER2-1800-1,242.176

This simply consists of a vest of woollen cloth , without sleeves , of a
deep garnet colour , and a large mantle , either of the same , or of a
thinner texture , somewhat resembling a shawl . TURNER2-1800-1,242.177

A sort of philibeg , and huge boots of Bulgar hide , lined either with
fur or cloth , and designed as well to promote warmth in travelling , as
for substantial use within doors , complete the dress .
TURNER2-1800-1,242.178

But though it surprised me at first , to see my friends trudging about
the house , in their massy boots , yet I soon became sensible of their
utility , as a defence against the chill arising in this cold climate ,
from their marble floors . The great scarcity of timber in Tibet , not
admiting them to board the floors of their rooms ,
TURNER2-1800-1,242.179

hence possibly arise <P_243> those cramps and rheumatic pains , with
which they are so frequently and so severely afflicted .
TURNER2-1800-1,243.180

After taking leave of the Regent , it was my intention to have paid a
visit to Soopoon Choomboo ; TURNER2-1800-1,243.181

but our audience had been protracted to a great length ,
TURNER2-1800-1,243.182

and we had no sooner risen , than all the bells of the monastery struck
up , as a summons to devotion . TURNER2-1800-1,243.183

The present occasion , the removal of the Lama , called for an
extraordinary attendance on the exercises of religion ;
TURNER2-1800-1,243.184

and all the Gylongs , we were told , applied themselves at this time ,
with redoubled fervor to the duty of prayer . TURNER2-1800-1,243.185

Not long after we had returned to our apartments , I was disturbed on a
sudden , by so confused and tumultuous a noise , that I was utterly at a
loss to what cause , to attribute this alarming uproar .
TURNER2-1800-1,243.186

At length , I was informed by my attendants , the Goseins , that it was
only the Gylongs at their <font> pooja <$$font> , or religious exercises
, TURNER2-1800-1,243.187

and I could not possibly refuse , to give them ample credit for their
zeal . TURNER2-1800-1,243.188

The following day I received an invitation from Soopoon Choomboo ,
TURNER2-1800-1,243.189

and we immediately prepared to wait upon him in his apartments , which ,
though remote from ours , yet form a part of that large assemblage of
rooms , which all together constitute the palace , and accommodate all
the officers of the court . TURNER2-1800-1,243.190

In going to them , it was unnecessary to pass along the open street ;
TURNER2-1800-1,243.191

for , by descending some stairs , ascending others , and traversing
several halls and passages , we came at length to the division of the
palace , which he occupied . TURNER2-1800-1,243.192

The room in which we found him , was rather narrow , being long and
lofty , in comparison of its width ; TURNER2-1800-1,243.193

but the advantage of its situation , amply counterbalanced every defect
in point of symmetry and proportion . TURNER2-1800-1,243.194

It commanded an <P_244> extensive view of the valley ,
TURNER2-1800-1,244.195

and was at once enlightened and warmed by a projecting balcony , which ,
from its position , admitted the rays of the sun nearly all the day ,
during the time he has southern declination , which , of course , is
their coldest season . TURNER2-1800-1,244.196

When we entered the room , the mohair curtains were partially drawn ;
TURNER2-1800-1,244.197

but even in this state , we were sensible of a grateful warmth .
TURNER2-1800-1,244.198

Soopoon Choomboo was seated close by the balcony .
TURNER2-1800-1,244.199

We each of us presented , as usual , a silk scarf ,
TURNER2-1800-1,244.200

and I delivered to him the letter and presents , with which I had been
charged . TURNER2-1800-1,244.201

We took our seats on piles of cushions that had been placed on the
opposite side of the room , when Soopoon Choomboo , after a few personal
compliments , instantly proposed various inquiries respecting the health
and situation of Mr. Hastings . TURNER2-1800-1,244.202

To his numberless questions I gave , as well as I was able , the most
satisfactory answers ; TURNER2-1800-1,244.203

and I endeavoured to express , in the strongest terms , the great
uneasiness to which I had been subject , in the noxious climate <paren>
as they esteem it <$$paren> of the country of Dukba ; contrasting my
unpleasant situation , while my journey hither stood in suspense , and I
dreaded the necessity of returning to Bengal without seeing him , or
Maha Raja , with the singular satisfaction I now experienced , in having
reached his court in safety . TURNER2-1800-1,244.204

I concluded with assurances , how highly acceptable these tidings would
prove to his friend the Governor . TURNER2-1800-1,244.205

He was profuse in his acknowledgments , of the high gratification and
honour he derived from the receipt of the Governor_General's dispatches
, TURNER2-1800-1,244.206

and stated the great anxiety , under which the Regent and himself had
laboured , as Poorungheer well knew , in contriving to conduct me to
Teshoo Loomboo . TURNER2-1800-1,244.207

<P_245>

In the recital of their embarrassments , though they are averse to own
any immediate dependence {TEXT:dependance} upon the Chinese , I could
plainly trace the greatest awe of the Emperor of China , of his officers
stationed at the court of Lassa , styled Umbas , as well as of the
Jasoos , and the Raja of that place , Gesub Rimbochay , who had usurped
even , from the hands of Dalai Lama , the greatest portion of his
temporal power . TURNER2-1800-1,245.209

The rest of our conversation turned chiefly upon my journey , the remote
distance , the difficulty of the way , and the difference of climate
between Bengal , Bootan , and Tibet : TURNER2-1800-1,245.210

these topics filled up the time till tea was introduced , of which we
all partook ; TURNER2-1800-1,245.211

this was succeeded by the usual offering of trays of fruit ,
TURNER2-1800-1,245.212

and we then received from his hands each of us a white silk scarf ,
TURNER2-1800-1,245.213

and retired . TURNER2-1800-1,245.214

While we were with Soopoon Choomboo , a messenger came in , apparently
from a long journey , booted , and carrying a whip in his hand , with
some important dispatches . TURNER2-1800-1,245.215

He first pulled off his hat , holding it with his left hand down to his
knee , TURNER2-1800-1,245.216

then bowing his body , he drew a crimson scarf from his breast , which
he presented , TURNER2-1800-1,245.217

and afterwards delivered his dispatches . TURNER2-1800-1,245.218

Having repeated a few words in a low voice , he bowed again ,
TURNER2-1800-1,245.219

and was dismissed with a single word and a nod . TURNER2-1800-1,245.220

This is one mode of salutation : TURNER2-1800-1,245.221

another kind of homage , which appeared to be due only to the sovereign
Lama , consists in an humble prostration of the body nine times to the
earth . TURNER2-1800-1,245.222

Soopoon Choomboo , who was styled also Sadeek , held the second rank in
the court of Teshoo Loomboo . TURNER2-1800-1,245.223

He was by birth a Mantchieux Tartar , TURNER2-1800-1,245.224

and was recommended to Teshoo Lama at an early age , by <P_246> Chanjea
Lama , who is a native of the same region , and who constantly resided
near the person of the Emperor of China . TURNER2-1800-1,246.225

Under the immediate care of Teshoo Lama he received his education ,
TURNER2-1800-1,246.226

and having proved himself a faithful , accomplished , and useful servant
, he at length acquired the complete confidence of his master ,
TURNER2-1800-1,246.227

and became , I was well assured , his particular favourite .
TURNER2-1800-1,246.228

As a public acknowledgment of his merit , he was appointed by Teshoo
Lama , not long before his death , to the presidency of an important
monastery styled Khonjin Shimboi , which had an establishment of
three_hundred Gylongs , and was endowed with an extensive territory upon
the western border of Tibet , near Luddauk . TURNER2-1800-1,246.229

The Emperor of China , during his attendance on the Lama at his court ,
conferred upon him the title of Mirkin Chassa Lama .
TURNER2-1800-1,246.230

As the office he filled at the time of the Lama's death was that of
Sadeek , which is synonymous with that of Zempi in Bootan , that is ,
cupbearer , he became of course invested with the charge of all the
Lama's effects , TURNER2-1800-1,246.231

and was to continue in this high trust , until the regenerated Lama
should be seated on the musnud {COM:throne} . TURNER2-1800-1,246.232

The singular favour he enjoyed , seems to have been no more than was
justly due to his integrity and talents ; TURNER2-1800-1,246.233

and in the event of the regency becoming vacant , from the general
estimation in which he was held , I had no doubt of his advancement to
that high honour . TURNER2-1800-1,246.234

His influence indeed at that time , was scarcely less powerful ,
TURNER2-1800-1,246.235

for he was treated by Chanjoo Cooshoo rather as a colleague , than as a
subordinate officer , TURNER2-1800-1,246.236

and his opinion was implicitly attended to on almost every occasion .
TURNER2-1800-1,246.237

A more harmonious agreement , or more perfect confidence , could not
possibly subsist between them . TURNER2-1800-1,246.238

<P_247>

The age of Soopoon Choomboo , at that time , did not exceed thirty .
TURNER2-1800-1,247.240

In stature he was rather low , but well proportioned , and not at all
inclined to corpulency . TURNER2-1800-1,247.241

His countenance was open and ingenuous , TURNER2-1800-1,247.242

yet his features were unequivocally impressed with the Tartar character
: small eyes , thin eyebrows , high cheek_bones , and without even the
rudiments of a beard . TURNER2-1800-1,247.243

His complexion was not darker than that of an Arab , or a Spaniard .
TURNER2-1800-1,247.244

Though possessing an acknowledged superiority of talent , information ,
and influence over his countrymen , he made no parade of these
advantages , TURNER2-1800-1,247.245

but conducted himself with singular humility , mildness , and modesty .
TURNER2-1800-1,247.246

He was not less communicative in his conversation , than conciliating in
his manners , TURNER2-1800-1,247.247

and , as our acquaintance improved , I found him cheerful , and
occasionally jocose . TURNER2-1800-1,247.248

The public office Soopoon Choomboo bore , as I have already observed ,
was that of Sadeek to the late Teshoo Lama . TURNER2-1800-1,247.249

Were I to seek for a title analogous to Sadeek , in our own language ,
by which I might render it intelligible to an English reader , I should
be at a loss to find one of so comprehensive a signification . Though
perhaps I might with some propriety style him , from his situation in
the court of the sovereign Pontiff , Prime Minister , or Cardinal ,
TURNER2-1800-1,247.250

yet who would expect to find the domestic servant , in a person invested
with so high a title ? TURNER2-1800-1,247.251

Nor yet does , Lord Chamberlain of the Household , Master of the
Ceremonies , and Master of the Robes , convey a complete idea of his
duties and his station . TURNER2-1800-1,247.252

The Sadeek receives and communicates the Lama's commands ;
TURNER2-1800-1,247.253

he is the immediate channel of conveying all information to him ;
TURNER2-1800-1,247.254

he makes <P_248> the arrangements necessary for the celebration of the
great festivals of religion ; TURNER2-1800-1,248.255

he is always personally attendant on the Lama ; TURNER2-1800-1,248.256

he is his cupbearer ; TURNER2-1800-1,248.257

he has charge of the wardrobe ; TURNER2-1800-1,248.258

and to his immediate care is intrusted all the wealth of the sovereign ,
whether derived from the religious offerings of his votaries , or from
other and less sacred sources . TURNER2-1800-1,248.259

He brings , and places before the Lama , all his food ,
TURNER2-1800-1,248.260

and in particular , pours out his tea , of which it is the custom first
to taste himself , in the presence of his master .
TURNER2-1800-1,248.261

In fact , I have been led to understand that Teshoo Lama receives
neither food nor raiment from any other hand ; TURNER2-1800-1,248.262

yet still he is found to hold a very high rank in the religious order ,
which is implied by no less a title than that of Lama .
TURNER2-1800-1,248.263

My arrival in Tibet happened at a period of high importance in the
annals of the state , as well in a political as a religious point of
view ; TURNER2-1800-1,248.264

for now they had to acknowledge , in the person of an infant , their
future sovereign , to whom also , as to their sacred pontiff , they were
about to pay the first public tribute of homage and allegiance , and
thereby to give currency and authority to the belief , that he was the
regenerated , immortal mediator with the Supreme .
TURNER2-1800-1,248.265

On such an occasion , it will easily be conceived , that no mark of
respect , no pomp or parade , was omitted , which , in their ideas ,
could possibly tend , to add dignity and splendour to the solemn
ceremony . TURNER2-1800-1,248.266

The Emperor of China , a votary of the Tibet faith , had commanded a
military officer of high rank , with a large detachment of troops , to
attend and escort the infant Lama ; TURNER2-1800-1,248.267

other Chinese attended , for the purpose of bearing his Tuckt rowan , or
moving throne ; TURNER2-1800-1,248.268

and the <P_249> Regent himself , assisted by Soopoon Choomboo , was to
conduct the cavalcade . TURNER2-1800-1,249.269

A curious desire , I must own , to be personally witness of so singular
a ceremony , induced me to make some effort to be admitted of the party
. TURNER2-1800-1,249.270

I accordingly ordered Poorungheer to wait upon the Regent and express my
earnest wishes to testify , on all occasions , the respect I entertained
for the character of the Lama ; and to say , that I should be peculiarly
happy to attend his suite , if he thought proper to allow me so great an
honour : TURNER2-1800-1,249.271

but however strongly my curiosity had been excited , I had formed no
great expectation that my offer would be accepted ;
TURNER2-1800-1,249.272

and I was therefore but little disappointed when Poorungheer returned to
me with excuses from the Regent , declining to accept the offer of my
company , on account of the Chinese , whose jealousy of strangers is too
well known , and to whom he was particularly anxious of giving no
occasion of offence : TURNER2-1800-1,249.273

but at the same time he politely acknowledged my attention ,
TURNER2-1800-1,249.274

and I had the satisfaction to hear , expressed himself greatly pleased
with it . TURNER2-1800-1,249.275

The party proceeded from the monastery , on Saturday the 27th of
September , before the dawn of day , towards Kylee , situated in the
valley of Painom , where the infant Lama at this time resided with his
parents . TURNER2-1800-1,249.276

The grand ceremony of his removal commenced the next day .
TURNER2-1800-1,249.277

The Lama was attended by a very numerous concourse of people , and
followed with every possible display of enthusiastic homage .
TURNER2-1800-1,249.278

The place prepared for his reception was not more than sixteen miles
from Kylee ; TURNER2-1800-1,249.279

yet so great was the retinue , and so frequently were <P_250> they
impeded by successive crowds of votaries , who threw themselves before
him in the way , in humble prostration , that it became absolutely
necessary to form an intermediate camp , in which they halted for the
night . TURNER2-1800-1,250.280

Moving again early in the following morning , in the course of that day
, they made their entry into the monastery of Terpaling .
TURNER2-1800-1,250.281

Having then placed the young Lama in the new monastery , together with
his father and mother , to whose care he was still very properly
committed , after making every necessary arrangement , the Regent and
his retinue returned to Teshoo Loomboo . TURNER2-1800-1,250.282

As the road lay in front of our apartments , I had an opportunity of
observing the Regent's approach . TURNER2-1800-1,250.283

He rode attended by two or three_hundred horsemen , the greater part of
whom preceded him , TURNER2-1800-1,250.284

and he himself followed surrounded by a select party , principally
consisting of the officers of state . TURNER2-1800-1,250.285

He was dressed in a garb very different from that , in which I had seen
him before . TURNER2-1800-1,250.286

It was a yellow satin robe , lined with sable fur , and fastened with a
girdle round the waist . TURNER2-1800-1,250.287

A garnet_coloured shawl mantle , partially covering his satin robe ,
according to their fashion , passed round the body ,
TURNER2-1800-1,250.288

and its end was gathered up to rest upon the left shoulder , leaving the
right arm at liberty . TURNER2-1800-1,250.289

He wore upon his head a round hat , covered with a yellow glossy lacker
that glittered in the sun , TURNER2-1800-1,250.290

and he had on red bulgar boots . TURNER2-1800-1,250.291

From his girdle , hung pendant a small knife case , with its implements
, and a large purse with a running string , in which he carried a tea
cup , and several other small articles , the constant appendages of a
Tartar dress . TURNER2-1800-1,250.292

To this also are commonly added , a smaller purse for money , and
<P_251> another filled with tobacco and a pipe , together with a little
pouch for tinder , containing a piece of flint , and edged at the bottom
with a bar of steel . TURNER2-1800-1,251.293

The horse he rode , was decorated with large crimson tassels , and other
splendid trappings , whilst a number of bells , suspended to a collar
that hung round his neck , jingled as he moved along with slow and
solemn pace . TURNER2-1800-1,251.294

The body of the horse , from the multitude of <font> Chowrs <$$font> ,
or cow tails , that hung on both sides , could scarcely be seen .
TURNER2-1800-1,251.295

The select attendants were equipped nearly after the same manner .
TURNER2-1800-1,251.296

The dress of those of more humble rank differed chiefly in the quality
of the materials . TURNER2-1800-1,251.297

They were clad , for the most part , in cloth , either yellow , or red ,
or striped with these colours , TURNER2-1800-1,251.298

and they wore upon their heads round hats , having large flowing tassels
of scarlet silk upon the centre of the crown . TURNER2-1800-1,251.299

Some had narrow braids a little turned up , TURNER2-1800-1,251.300

and others were bordered by broad bands of fur . TURNER2-1800-1,251.301

The most extraordinary in appearance were those worn by the Kilmauks
<paren> Calmucs <$$paren> , which were of vast dimensions , I suppose
not less than two feet in diameter , with shallow crowns , but monstrous
brims ; the whole covered with long locks of wool matted together , of a
gaudy yellow colour . TURNER2-1800-1,251.302

Some Goseins , wearing turbans and the Indian habit , with Moguls from
the borders of Persia , in their national dress , assisted also to
compose this motley group . TURNER2-1800-1,251.303

There were none in the whole cavalcade , as far as I could perceive ,
who bore any kind of arms . TURNER2-1800-1,251.304

Heaps of fire were distinguishable to a very remote distance , burning
on either side of the road , and emitting columns of thick smoke .
TURNER2-1800-1,251.305

These bonfires , which I have already noticed , are a mark of respect
shewn <P_252> by the inhabitants of Tibet and Bootan to every great
personage who travels through their neighbourhood ;
TURNER2-1800-1,252.306

and when their sovereign passes by , the custom is of course observed
with extraordinary zeal and attention . TURNER2-1800-1,252.307

Many persons on both sides the road prostrated themselves upon the
ground , as the Regent with his retinue advanced ;
TURNER2-1800-1,252.308

and when he drew near to Teshoo Loomboo , banners were hoisted upon the
palace walls , TURNER2-1800-1,252.309

and the nowbut , trumpets , gongs , and cymbals , conspired to announce
his entry in their loudest tones . TURNER2-1800-1,252.310

The Chinese commander , with his detachment of troops , took this route
in preference to that by Jhansu-jeung , on his return to Lassa .
TURNER2-1800-1,252.311

The ground marked out for their encampment was upon the edge of the
plain , just without the limits of the monastery , under the fortress of
Shigatzee-jeung , and close upon the banks of the Painom-tchieu .
TURNER2-1800-1,252.312

Here the troops halted two days , after which they struck their tents ,
and marched away . TURNER2-1800-1,252.313

I sought an early opportunity to congratulate the Regent upon his return
, and the safe conveyance of the Lama to Terpaling .
TURNER2-1800-1,252.314

This gave occasion to some reflections from the Regent , full of
reverence and affection for the late Lama , and tending to establish the
identity of the <P_253> present , from the unerring signs of wisdom and
greatness stamped upon his brow , and the early traits of his sublime
character which had been already evidently displayed .
TURNER2-1800-1,253.315

Nor did he drop the subject , without enlarging on the partiality which
the Lama had entertained for the English in his state of pre-existence ,
and regretting that his tender age rendered him at present unable to
converse with me . TURNER2-1800-1,253.316

Much conversation afterwards followed , on the subject of my commission
, in which he manifested great anxiety to remove any unfavourable idea I
might have formed , respecting his friendly disposition , in consequence
of the difficulties which had been thrown in the way of my proceeding to
his court . TURNER2-1800-1,253.317

He told me that many letters had passed upon the subject between him and
Dalai Lama , who was always favourably inclined towards the English ;
TURNER2-1800-1,253.318

but he principally attributed the discouragement and obstruction I had
experienced to Gesub Rimbochay : TURNER2-1800-1,253.319

in his apologies also he glanced strongly at the Chinese .
TURNER2-1800-1,253.320

The Tibetians do not , it is true , bend under the immediate authority
of that court ; TURNER2-1800-1,253.321

but its influence overawes them in all their proceedings ,
TURNER2-1800-1,253.322

and produces a timidity and caution in their conduct , more suited to
the character of subjects , than allies . TURNER2-1800-1,253.323

The jealousy with which they regard this interference of the Chinese ,
and their uneasiness under the yoke , though it rests so lightly upon
them , was manifest , from the distant reserve with which they treated
those officers and troops , who came for no other purpose than to do
honour to their high-priest . TURNER2-1800-1,253.324

They were not suffered to lodge within the confines of the monastery ;
TURNER2-1800-1,253.325

this , I understood , would have been considered as a <P_254> kind of
profanation , TURNER2-1800-1,254.326

for they look upon the Chinese as a gross and impure race of men .
TURNER2-1800-1,254.327

They were evidently impatient during their stay , TURNER2-1800-1,254.328

and assumed an unusual air of secrecy , to prevent their obtaining a
knowledge of any thing relating to their affairs , until the day of
their departure , which was announced to me , by many persons belonging
to the monastery with much apparent satisfaction .

<$$heading>

Having previously obtained permission from the Regent , I found a
convenient opportunity , before his return from Terpaling , to
accomplish an object I had much at heart , and which will consequently
claim from me , very minute and particular attention .
TURNER2-1800-1,255.345

From the first day of my arrival at Teshoo Loomboo , I was extremely
desirous of viewing the interior of some one of those magnificent
edifices , in the midst of which I had taken up my abode , and which
continually excited my curiosity by the profuse and costly ornaments
bestowed upon their outside . TURNER2-1800-1,255.346

The frequent recurrence of solemn sounds from a variety of deep_toned
instruments , after short pauses of profound silence ; the low hum of
invocation , during both night and day ; and occasionally the <P_256>
more vociferous clamour of crowded congregations , joined with a full
choral band ; left me no room to doubt , that I was close to the scene ,
of some of the most solemn and mysterious ceremonies of their religion .
TURNER2-1800-1,256.347

I lost little time in endeavouring to ascertain the truth of my
conjectures ; TURNER2-1800-1,256.348

but I trod upon tender ground . TURNER2-1800-1,256.349

Any indication of extraordinary curiosity , even in the common affairs
of life , was sufficient to raise , in an instant , an host of
suspicions , against which , I should have been compelled eternally to
combat ; TURNER2-1800-1,256.350

and religion , especially among a people so bigotted to its forms , was
a subject to which I adverted , with still more scrupulous caution .
TURNER2-1800-1,256.351

From various inquiries , however , at length I collected , that the
chapel in which the Gylongs met to offer up their daily prayers , was
but a short distance from us . TURNER2-1800-1,256.352

Their stated periods of devotion were the rising of the sun , noon , and
sunset . TURNER2-1800-1,256.353

Among two_thousand_five_hundred Gylongs , appointed for the service of
the monastery , the greater part were expected to be present on each
occasion . TURNER2-1800-1,256.354

On every third day , the morning was devoted to proclaiming aloud the
attributes and praises of the Supreme Being ; a service which was
performed with a vehemence of vociferation perfectly astonishing , and ,
as I thought , altogether inconsistent with the decorum of a well
regulated assembly . TURNER2-1800-1,256.355

The object of this solemn meeting , as far as I could collect , was for
every individual present to repeat , and enforce with all his powers of
utterance , the praises of the Deity ; TURNER2-1800-1,256.356

and we need not wonder that from such a congregation , who had attained
by long practice to a <P_257> Stentorian strength of lungs , there
should arise the most surprising discord , the very counterpart of that
which is produced by the vociferations of an enraged and hostile
multitude . TURNER2-1800-1,257.357

But all this was , in fact , nothing more than a pious token of the most
ardent zeal , a sort of contest for the palm , a struggle , which should
do the highest honour to his supreme and tutelary gods .
TURNER2-1800-1,257.358

To the public exercises of their faith , must be added the private
prayers in the apartments of the inferior Lamas , which are always
accompanied by music , together with the solemn pageantry of processions
moving almost everyday around the environs of the monastery .
TURNER2-1800-1,257.359

All these , taken together , soon sufficiently convinced me , that I was
in the midst of men , who made religion the sole business of their life
. TURNER2-1800-1,257.360

With the errors of their opinions , or their practice , I had no concern
. TURNER2-1800-1,257.361

The immediate advantages resulting from them they themselves daily
experience . TURNER2-1800-1,257.362

Having voluntarily devoted themselves to the severities and the duties
of their religion , they obtain a large portion of grateful respect from
their countrymen , whose worldly avocations exempt them from the same
particular services . TURNER2-1800-1,257.363

Both , united in one common bond of union , the one part to labour , the
other to pray , enjoy in peace and harmony , the fruits of their
industry ; TURNER2-1800-1,257.364

and find it unnecessary to support a single man in arms , either to
defend their territory , or maintain their rights .
TURNER2-1800-1,257.365

Placing their sole reliance in the mediation of the sacred Lama , the
immaculate vicegerent of the Supreme , they imagine , that he covers
them with the broadest shield , from the encroachments of others ;
TURNER2-1800-1,257.366

and the benign influence of his doctrines teaches them to be benevolent
, merciful , and humane to all around them . TURNER2-1800-1,257.367

<P_258>

The love , the veneration , the unanimity I saw expressed , effectually
convinced me that they were happy . TURNER2-1800-1,258.369

But to return to my narrative : the room in which I wrote , and the
suite of apartments allotted to the accommodation of myself , and the
companion of my travels , were erected by the late Teshoo Lama for his
own private residence , whenever he chose to retire into uninterrupted
solitude . TURNER2-1800-1,258.370

In an adjacent building , upon the right hand , are lodged his mortal
remains ; in another , upon the left , those of a former Lama , whose
spirit exchanged its corporeal residence more than a century ago .
TURNER2-1800-1,258.371

The Teshoo Lama , I was told , had lavished upon this shrine of his
predecessor , immense wealth ; TURNER2-1800-1,258.372

yet his own , which was nearly completed before his visit to the Emperor
of China , had been since greatly enriched by the tributary offerings
made to him on that journey , TURNER2-1800-1,258.373

and was now considered as the most splendid and magnificent of the two .
TURNER2-1800-1,258.374

When I became acquainted with these particulars , situated as I was so
near the mausoleum of our departed friend , I wanted not an excellent
pretext for desiring to visit it ; TURNER2-1800-1,258.375

and having waited for a favourable opportunity , I urged my plea with
such success , that the Regent , Chanjoo Cooshoo , immediately signified
his most willing acquiescence in my wishes . TURNER2-1800-1,258.376

Early in the morning my faithful attendant Gooroobah , came to conduct
me . TURNER2-1800-1,258.377

Proceeding from my apartment , along the corridor , we descended two
flights of stairs , TURNER2-1800-1,258.378

and passing through some passages , without any communication with the
street , came to a small gate , which we entered ,
TURNER2-1800-1,258.379

and found ourselves in the inclosure immediately before the grand
mausoleum . TURNER2-1800-1,258.380

Three sides of this court_yard , which <P_259> was paved , were
surrounded with a colonnade , for the occasional accommodation of
pilgrims , and other devotees . TURNER2-1800-1,259.381

Upon the walls of this colonnade , were rudely painted many emblematical
figures , of gigantic proportions , illustrative of various parts of
their system of mythology . TURNER2-1800-1,259.382

The two principal figures , of enormous size , depicted with hideous
countenances , and coloured with blue and scarlet , represented
incarnations of Cali . TURNER2-1800-1,259.383

The pillars were painted with vermilion , and ornamented with gilding ;
TURNER2-1800-1,259.384

and upon the pediment which they supported , was introduced the imperial
figure of the Chinese dragon . TURNER2-1800-1,259.385

In the centre of the colonnade was a large gate , which opened to a
principal avenue of the monastery . TURNER2-1800-1,259.386

Immediately opposite to this gate , stood the portico of the mausoleum ,
on the top of which , within a low railing , was placed the following
device , resembling a coat of arms . TURNER2-1800-1,259.387

The centre piece , which was of a spear-like form , resembling the leaf
of the pepul tree , was placed upon a low pedestal .
TURNER2-1800-1,259.388

On each side , was the figure of an animal , not unlike a deer couchant
, with the head elevated , the nose pointing upwards , and the throat
resting upon the shoulder , or projecting part , of the hastated machine
between them , which I conjectured to be about eight feet high .
TURNER2-1800-1,259.389

The whole extended from one side of the portico to the other ,
TURNER2-1800-1,259.390

stood entirely clear of the body of the building ,
TURNER2-1800-1,259.391

and was very richly gilt . TURNER2-1800-1,259.392

It had all together , the appearance of a coat of arms with supporters ,
but upon a very large scale . TURNER2-1800-1,259.393

The centre piece , I was informed , contained within it , some of their
sacred writings . TURNER2-1800-1,259.394

Under the portico , sat a priest , who read with a book before him ,
<P_260> apparently regardless of our presence . TURNER2-1800-1,260.395

It was his duty , together with others , who occasionally relieved him ,
to pray eternally upon the same spot , and keep alive the sacred fire ,
that burns before the shrine . TURNER2-1800-1,260.396

Two ponderous doors , painted with vermilion , and embossed with huge
gilded knobs , made the whole fabric ring , as their pivots grated
within the sockets , TURNER2-1800-1,260.397

and their massy sides came with strong concussion against the walls .
TURNER2-1800-1,260.398

It now appeared , that the building we had hitherto seen , served only
as a case , to cover a most beautiful pyramid placed within it .
TURNER2-1800-1,260.399

At the base of this pyramid , the body of the late Lama was deposited in
a coffin of pure gold , made by command of the Emperor of China , upon
the decease of the Lama at his court , and in which the body was
conveyed , with the utmost solemnity and state , from Pekin , through
the provinces of China and Tibet , to Teshoo Loomboo .
TURNER2-1800-1,260.400

His votaries all the way , paid the most profound homage to his manes ,
TURNER2-1800-1,260.401

and thought themselves peculiarly blessed , if they could but touch the
pall , or any part of the bier , as the funeral procession passed slowly
along . TURNER2-1800-1,260.402

It is the custom in Tibet , to preserve entire the mortal remains of
their sovereign Lamas only ; TURNER2-1800-1,260.403

every other corpse is either consumed by fire , or given to be the
promiscuous food of beasts and birds of prey . TURNER2-1800-1,260.404

As soon as life has left the body of a Lama , it is placed upright ,
sitting in an attitude of devotion , his legs being folded before him ,
with the instep resting upon each thigh , and the soles of the feet
turned upwards . TURNER2-1800-1,260.405

To a person unused to the practice , this must be a posture of extreme
constraint ; though Lam Rimbochay , of Bootan , has repeatedly placed
himself in it before me , with much apparent ease .
TURNER2-1800-1,260.406

<P_261>

The right hand is rested with its back upon the thigh , with the thumb
bent across the palm . TURNER2-1800-1,261.408

The left arm is bent and held close to the body , the hand being open ,
and the thumb , at right angles with the fingers , touching the point of
the shoulder . TURNER2-1800-1,261.409

This is the attitude of abstracted meditation . TURNER2-1800-1,261.410

The eyes , at the same time , being directed downwards , and half closed
, indicate that , with the suspended powers of the body , the faculties
of the mind also , are completely absorbed in contemplation ,
effectually guarded against wandering , and shut to every species of
external impression . TURNER2-1800-1,261.411

The late Teshoo Lama is represented in an effigy of gold , which crowns
the pyramid , and is placed within the concave of a large shell ,
radiated alternately , with white and red , the edges being scolloped ,
and projecting so far as to form a canopy , that incloses within its
hollow , the whole body of the figure . TURNER2-1800-1,261.412

The image is represented sitting upon cushions , TURNER2-1800-1,261.413

and has the drapery of a yellow satin mantle , negligently flowing over
the lower part , whilst a cap , resembling a mitre , covers the head .
TURNER2-1800-1,261.414

As a tribute of respect , which might be gratifying to his votaries ,
and tend to conciliate their affection , I made an offering of a white
pelong scarf , which the attending priest received , and passed over the
smoke of the incense burning before the shrine , while the Gosein and
others prostrated themselves nine times with devout humility .
TURNER2-1800-1,261.415

The priest then ascended a ladder , TURNER2-1800-1,261.416

and put one end of the scarf upon that hand of the image which was a
little advanced ; TURNER2-1800-1,261.417

the other hung down upon the pyramid . TURNER2-1800-1,261.418

Round the borders of the canopy , were suspended all the various
rosaries , of the richest gems , used by the Lama during his life ;
TURNER2-1800-1,261.419

they consisted of pearls , emeralds , rubies , sapphires , <P_262> coral
, amber , crystal , lapis lazuli , and even beads of humble ser-bu-jya .
intermixed together , and hanging in festoons . TURNER2-1800-1,262.420

The sides of the pyramid were encased with plates of solid silver .
TURNER2-1800-1,262.421

On each step that composed the structure , which gradually diminished in
breadth and depth , from the base to the vertex , were arranged all
sorts of rarities , and articles of curious workmanship , which had been
presented at different times as offerings to the late Lama .
TURNER2-1800-1,262.422

Among these , were various costly snuff-boxes , and valuable trinkets ,
the tribute of the Emperor ; with choice specimens of China , large jars
of old blue japan , and masses of lapis lazuli , variously arranged ,
and disposed , according to their taste , not without considerable
effect . TURNER2-1800-1,262.423

About breast-high from the base of the pyramid , was one step
considerably deeper than the rest , in front of which were represented
two lions rampant , carved in relievo , TURNER2-1800-1,262.424

and between them was placed a human figure , with eyes extravagantly
large and prominent ; TURNER2-1800-1,262.425

his countenance was expressive of the most anxious agitation , and his
person thrown into strange contortions : TURNER2-1800-1,262.426

his hands were applied to a stringed instrument , called a cittaur .
TURNER2-1800-1,262.427

Other instruments of music , hautboys , trumpets , and cymbals , were
placed upon each extremity of the step , immediately before these
figures ; TURNER2-1800-1,262.428

and the intermediate space was filled with china jars , and vases of
silver and blue japan . TURNER2-1800-1,262.429

On the right side of the pyramid , was placed another image of the Lama
, as large as life , and , as Poorungheer assured me , a very faithful
resemblance of his person . TURNER2-1800-1,262.430

It was placed in a sort of pulpit , beneath a canopy of silk , in a
devout attitude , with a book before it . TURNER2-1800-1,262.431

This <P_263> image , I was given to understand , was not of gold , but
solid silver , gilt . TURNER2-1800-1,263.432

In front of the pyramid , on an altar covered with white cloth , were
spread about the common objects of daily oblation ; such as fruits , and
flowers , with various kinds of corn , and oil . TURNER2-1800-1,263.433

Intermixed among the offerings , were seen at the same time , several
lamps burning , which , being considered as sacred fire , are never
permitted to go out ; TURNER2-1800-1,263.434

the smoke arising from these , and from a multitude of odoriferous
tapers , filled the surrounding space , TURNER2-1800-1,263.435

and strongly perfumed the air . TURNER2-1800-1,263.436

On each side of the pyramid , hung suspended from the ceiling by one end
, whole pieces of the most beautiful silks and satins .
TURNER2-1800-1,263.437

Close to the pyramid were two pieces of black velvet , embroidered all
over with pearls , in squares like network , and finished with a border
of the same . TURNER2-1800-1,263.438

Some pieces of very handsome English brocades , and Benares gull-budden
, completed this rich display . TURNER2-1800-1,263.439

On the surrounding walls were painted , from the bottom to the top ,
many rows of Gylongs , represented in the act of praying .
TURNER2-1800-1,263.440

Upon the floor , and on all sides , were high piles of sacred books ,
appertaining to the religion of the Lamas , which orthodox professors of
that faith , industriously employ themselves to augment with voluminous
commentaries . TURNER2-1800-1,263.441

Having thus endeavoured to give as distinct an account as a cursory view
could qualify me to do , of the valuable materials that contribute to
enrich and adorn the mausoleum of the Lama , I must here close my
description . TURNER2-1800-1,263.442

To attempt to form an estimate of its riches , <P_264> from my own
observation , or to repeat the exaggerated reports , which others even
relate with diffidence , might equally subject me to the imputation of
extravagant fiction . TURNER2-1800-1,264.443

The shell , or covering of the pyramid , which constitutes the exterior
of the mausoleum , is a structure , when viewed at some distance , of
considerable magnitude and beauty . TURNER2-1800-1,264.444

It stands upon the side of a rocky hill , TURNER2-1800-1,264.445

and is very conspicuously situated , towering high above the greater
part of the monastery . TURNER2-1800-1,264.446

The architecture must not be criticised by scientific rules ,
TURNER2-1800-1,264.447

for the different orders , as adopted in Europe , appear to be entirely
unknown in Tibet , where they seem rather to have chosen the use of a
mixed kind . TURNER2-1800-1,264.448

The pillar , scolloped arch , and pediment of Asia , or Hindostan ,
prevail in the interior apartments ; TURNER2-1800-1,264.449

the external decorations are of Chinese , or Tartar origin , similar to
those of the watch tower , or temple of the former ; the tented canopy
and imperial dragon . TURNER2-1800-1,264.450

As far as the mason has been concerned , it is a plain substantial
building of stone , with cement . TURNER2-1800-1,264.451

It is longer in front than in depth , and considerably more lofty than
either . TURNER2-1800-1,264.452

The walls are built so much thicker at the base , as to give them a very
perceptible slope . TURNER2-1800-1,264.453

The centre of the building has a very large window above the portico ,
furnished with curtains of black mohair . TURNER2-1800-1,264.454

The walls , in various parts , are ornamented with circular
representations either of the sun , or full moon , and with gilded
crescents . TURNER2-1800-1,264.455

Above the window runs a headband all round of a deep garnet colour .
TURNER2-1800-1,264.456

Higher than this headband , in the centre of the front , within a tablet
, the mystic sentence , <font> Oom maunee paimee oom <$$font> , is
inscribed in large golden characters . TURNER2-1800-1,264.457

A blank interval then succeeds , TURNER2-1800-1,264.458

and over {COM:text_partly_missing} that , a space of
{COM:illustration_omitted} <P_265> about ten or twelve feet from the
summit of the walls , is occupied by a deep crimson colour .
TURNER2-1800-1,265.459

A frieze , and whitened cornice surrounds the top .
TURNER2-1800-1,265.460

At the angles , and on different parts along the top of the wall , is
placed a sort of ornament , which I term fasces .
TURNER2-1800-1,265.461

It is a cylinder of metal strongly gilt standing upright upon a short
supporter fixed in its centre ; TURNER2-1800-1,265.462

and is commonly about five feet high , and two or three in circumference
. TURNER2-1800-1,265.463

Many of them are covered with black cloth , TURNER2-1800-1,265.464

and these invariably have a broad white fillet , passed round them in
opposite directions , horizontally and perpendicularly , so as to form
the figure of a cross . TURNER2-1800-1,265.465

The sides are marked with letters , beaded and fluted ;
TURNER2-1800-1,265.466

and the top is always crowned with some small ornament .
TURNER2-1800-1,265.467

The heads of lions , well executed , projected from the angles of the
building ; TURNER2-1800-1,265.468

these also were gilt , TURNER2-1800-1,265.469

and had bells depending from their lower lips . TURNER2-1800-1,265.470

But the most showy part of this structure , which crowns the whole , is
a spacious tented canopy , richly gilt , which is supposed to stand
immediately over the remains of the Lama , and the centre of the pyramid
; TURNER2-1800-1,265.471

it overshadows the summit of the building , from the body of which it is
elevated by its own particular support , forming to the whole an elegant
and graceful finish . TURNER2-1800-1,265.472

The edges of the canopy swell out in a bold and easy sweep .
TURNER2-1800-1,265.473

The ridge is decorated with the Chinese dragon , whose convolutions fill
up all that space ; TURNER2-1800-1,265.474

and round the canopy are hung a prodigious number of small bells , which
, as well as those , which are distributed about all the projections of
the building , having thin square pieces of wood fastened to the clapper
, make an inconceivable jingle , with every breeze that blows .

<P_267>

At all times , when I met the Regent , Soopoon Choomboo was in company .
TURNER2-1800-1,267.520

The distinguished attention shewn to him , and the part he generally
took in conversation , plainly bespoke his consequence .
TURNER2-1800-1,267.521

I thought him intelligent , quick of apprehension , and , as well as the
Regent , extremely communicative . TURNER2-1800-1,267.522

I was not a little surprised to discover , by their conversation , how
accurate an idea they had acquired of the position of different
countries , though maps and charts are totally unknown among them .
TURNER2-1800-1,267.523

Of China <paren> or Geanna <$$paren> their own travels had taught them
the situation ; TURNER2-1800-1,267.524

and they pointed out to me , not only the relative bearings of the
countries surrounding them , as China on the east ; Siberia on the north
; Turkestan , Cashmeer , Almora , on the west ; Nipal {COM:sic} , Bootan
, Assam , to the south , and Bengal beyond these ; but also of England ,
and of Russia , with almost equal truth . TURNER2-1800-1,267.525

Yet , desirous to extend their knowledge , a great variety of questions
were proposed to me , relating to the peculiar produce , temperature of
climate , and different distances , of remote countries .
TURNER2-1800-1,267.526

Bengal , of which they had from various authorities collected a
tolerably distinct idea , they expressed a most eager curiosity to visit
. TURNER2-1800-1,267.527

Nor can , perhaps , the inhabitants of a rocky , arid , bleak , and
naked region , fancy a scene more enchanting , than is exhibited in a
country of wide extent , presenting throughout a smooth and equal
surface , clothed with eternal verdure , intersected by numberless deep
and copious rivers , abounding with groves of large and shady trees ,
and yielding an immense variety of fruits and flowers , through every
season of the year . TURNER2-1800-1,267.528
