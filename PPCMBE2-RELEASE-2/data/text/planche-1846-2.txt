Scene I . PLANCHE-1846-2,5.6

- The Home Park Hampton Court ; PLANCHE-1846-2,5.7

<$$heading>

<font> With Tree called " King Charles's Swing , " in the centre .
<$$font> PLANCHE-1846-2,5.9

Ormonde , Wentworth , Norris , <font> and other officers , seated at a
table under the tree , with wine before them <$$font>
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.10

<font> Went. <$$font> You@ @'ve passed the wine again , Ormonde !
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.11

One would suppose the bottle was a lady , you are so remarkably shy of
it . PLANCHE-1846-2,5.12

<font> Orm. <$$font> My dear Wentworth , you are so far right , that I
treat wine as I do women - with the greatest respect ; but taking care
that neither shall intoxicate me . PLANCHE-1846-2,5.13

<font> Enter <$$font> Hector O'Donoghue , C. PLANCHE-1846-2,5.14

<font> Nor. <$$font> Here@ @'s Hector at last . PLANCHE-1846-2,5.15

<font> Went. <$$font> Where the deuce do you come from ?
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.16

<font> Hec. <$$font> From the county of Wicklow : PLANCHE-1846-2,5.17

I@ @'ve told you so often enough . PLANCHE-1846-2,5.18

<bracket> <font> Sings <$$font> <$$bracket> " My father was an
O'Donoghue , PLANCHE-1846-2,5.19

and my mother was an O'Grady . " PLANCHE-1846-2,5.20

<font> Went. <$$font> Poh , stuff ! I mean <font> now <$$font> .
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.21

Where have you been ? PLANCHE-1846-2,5.22

<font> Hec. <$$font> Is it where have I been ? PLANCHE-1846-2,5.23

Doing the agreeable to the Ladies of the Bedchamber and the Maids of
Honour - long life to 'em . PLANCHE-1846-2,5.24

Sure I@ @'ve had six of the beauties all alone to myself this blessed
morning , more shame for you , boys ; PLANCHE-1846-2,5.25

it@ @'s a disgrace to the corps . PLANCHE-1846-2,5.26

<font> Orm. <$$font> He@ @'s right - PLANCHE-1846-2,5.27

he@ @'s right : PLANCHE-1846-2,5.28

we@ @'ve been remiss in our duties . PLANCHE-1846-2,5.29

Hector is certainly the most gallant officer amongst us .
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.30

For my part , I confess - much as I admire the sex - I am the worst
dangler after a petticoat in existence . PLANCHE-1846-2,5.31

<font> Hec. <$$font> You are , PLANCHE-1846-2,5.32

you are - PLANCHE-1846-2,5.33

you may say that : PLANCHE-1846-2,5.34

notwithstanding my brilliant example , I shall never make a lady's man
of you . PLANCHE-1846-2,5.35

But you@ @'re a good fellow , Ormonde , and my friend ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.36

and I@ @m yours , my boy - PLANCHE-1846-2,5.37

you may take your oath of that - " till death do us part , " as the
saying is . PLANCHE-1846-2,5.38

Oh , musha ! I@ @'d be run through the body for you any day .
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.39

<P_6>

<font> Orm. <$$font> My dear Hector , I hope I shall never need such a
proof of your friendship . <font> Nor. <$$font> Notwithstanding which
, he would not hesitate to run away with your mistress , if you had one
- and run you through the body if you ran after him .
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.41

<font> Hec. <$$font> Captain Norris , allow me politely to inform you
that you labour under a mistake , sir . PLANCHE-1846-2,6.42

I@ @'m as likely to make myself a fool for a woman as any man ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.43

but I have the weakness of being particular upon one point ,
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.44

and that@ @'s this - PLANCHE-1846-2,6.45

if even the wife , or the mistress , of any friend of mine , was to get
on the blind side of my heart , and make me the victim of my natural
susceptibility , it@ @'s my own throat that I@ @'d cut , for shame - and
not that of the friend I had injured , like a big blackguard as I should
be . PLANCHE-1846-2,6.46

<font> Went. <$$font> Hear , hear , the Irish moralist - the reverend
Father O'Donoghue ! PLANCHE-1846-2,6.47

Gentlemen , I vote for the canonization of our holy brother !
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.48

He shall figure in the calendar as Saint Hector , the patron of husbands
. PLANCHE-1846-2,6.49

<font> Hec. <$$font> By the powers , Lieutenant Wentworth , I@ @'ll
give you an opportunity of being sainted before me .
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.50

<bracket> <font> Draws <$$font> " After you's manners , " all the world
over . PLANCHE-1846-2,6.51

<bracket> <font> All rise <$$font> PLANCHE-1846-2,6.52

<font> Orm. <$$font> Hector , put up , this moment !
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.53

Are you mad ? PLANCHE-1846-2,6.54

Do you know where we are ? PLANCHE-1846-2,6.55

- in the palace : PLANCHE-1846-2,6.56

and for a harmless joke - PLANCHE-1846-2,6.57

<font> Went. <$$font> Oh , if Captain O'Donoghue wishes it , ten
minutes walk will take us clear of the royal domain .
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.58

<font> Nor. <$$font> No , no - this is folly , PLANCHE-1846-2,6.59

and I am to blame more than any one . PLANCHE-1846-2,6.60

I began the attack , PLANCHE-1846-2,6.61

and if anybody fights , it must be me . PLANCHE-1846-2,6.62

<font> Orm. <$$font> But nobody shall fight upon this silly matter .
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.63

Hector , give me a proof of your friendship by offering your hand to
Wentworth , who , I am sure , never meant to offend you .
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.64

<font> Hec. <$$font> If the gentleman himself will say as much ?
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.65

<font> Went. <$$font> I should only speak the truth -
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.66

<font> Hec. <$$font> There@ @'s my hand , then , with all the pleasure
in life . <bracket> <font> They shake hands <$$font> <$$bracket>
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.67

By the mass ! though I@ @'m an Irishman , I@ @'ve no fancy for fighting
my friends - unless they@ @'re my enemies : PLANCHE-1846-2,6.68

and that@ @'s no bull , though it sounds like one ; PLANCHE-1846-2,6.69

for there@ @'s many a man ruined by his friends , who@ @'d have been
never the worse for all his foes could have done to him .
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.70

<font> Nor. <$$font> It@ @'s lucky , Ormonde , that another of your
friends was not here , PLANCHE-1846-2,6.71

we might have had more difficulty in keeping the king's peace .
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.72

<font> Orm. <$$font> You mean my Scotch kinsman , the Laird of
Killiecrankie , <P_7> of course . PLANCHE-1846-2,7.73

It would not have been his fault , certainly , if matters had taken a
quiet turn . <font> Hec. <$$font> Particularly as I had the honour to
be of the party . PLANCHE-1846-2,7.74

He@ @'d give his ears , I believe , to pick a quarrel with me ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.75

and it is only because I know it vexes him that I wo@ @n't give him the
opportunity . PLANCHE-1846-2,7.76

<font> Orm. <$$font> Why , how have you offended him ?
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.77

<font> Hec. <$$font> I wear Brussells point PLANCHE-1846-2,7.78

and use Hungary water - PLANCHE-1846-2,7.79

scent my gloves with musk and amber , PLANCHE-1846-2,7.80

and carry a gold toothpick . PLANCHE-1846-2,7.81

What does it signify ? PLANCHE-1846-2,7.82

When you want to beat a dog it@ @'s easy to find a stick .
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.83

<font> Orm. <$$font> But why want to quarrel with you in particular ?
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.84

<font> Hec. <$$font> For the sake of contradiction - because I wo@ @n't
let him . PLANCHE-1846-2,7.85

I overpower him with civility - PLANCHE-1846-2,7.86

take all his rude speeches as compliments - PLANCHE-1846-2,7.87

and keep him in a magnificent state of inflammation , that may
ultimately end in spontaneous combustion . PLANCHE-1846-2,7.88

<font> Orm. <$$font> Have a care , Hector - PLANCHE-1846-2,7.89

he is an awkward person to jest with . PLANCHE-1846-2,7.90

He is a master of fence ; PLANCHE-1846-2,7.91

and has , 't@ @is said , a particular lunge , that no man has yet
effectually parried . PLANCHE-1846-2,7.92

<font> Hec. <$$font> I@ @'ll trouble him for a specimen of it some day
when I@ @'m tired of my life . PLANCHE-1846-2,7.93

He shall keep me for one by way of a <font> bonne bouche <$$font> .
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.94

And , talk of the devil , here he comes with his Andrea Ferrara , which
is so inseparable from his body that I believe he was born with it .
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.95

It would puzzle St. Patrick to say , whether he carries the sword or
the sword carries him . <font> Enter <$$font> Killiecrankie , L. 2.

I just thank you PLANCHE-1846-2,7.106

and pledge you in return . PLANCHE-1846-2,7.107

<font> Hec. <$$font> Bravo , major ! PLANCHE-1846-2,7.108

Hear the major . PLANCHE-1846-2,7.109

<font> Kil. <$$font> Hoolie and fairlie , Captain O'Donoghue -
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.110

or in the excess o' your cordiality you may disarrange your toilet .
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.111

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh , faith , then , I@ @'d rather have to mend my
clothes than my manners ; PLANCHE-1846-2,7.112

and it@ @'s a mighty big hole I@ @'d make in them , if I neglected the
least opportunity of expressing my admiration {TEXT:damiration} of the
talent , and respect for the character , of major Killiecrankie .
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.113

<P_8> <font> Orm. <$$font> The friend of Prince Rupert and Montrose .
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.114

<font> Kil. <$$font> The friend of Henry Ormonde , young man , and of
his father before him . PLANCHE-1846-2,8.115

<font> Went. <$$font> The victor in thirty mortal combats .
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.116

<font> Kil. <$$font> You@ @'ll pardon me , sir , barely half that
number , and not all mortal ; PLANCHE-1846-2,8.117

some of my adversaries are still living . PLANCHE-1846-2,8.118

<font> Hec. <$$font> It is'@ @nt possible ! PLANCHE-1846-2,8.119

<font> Kil. <$$font> Ha ! saul o' my body ! do you doubt my word ,

What is@ @n't possible , sir ? PLANCHE-1846-2,8.121

<font> Hec. <$$font> That they should still be your adversaries , Major
. PLANCHE-1846-2,8.122

Those who have been spared by such an arm , must feel too grateful to

<bracket> <font> aloud <$$font> <$$bracket> Sir , I@ @'m no braggadocio
. PLANCHE-1846-2,8.125

The number and issue of my encounters are matters o' history .
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.126

I will not say unfortunately , PLANCHE-1846-2,8.127

for my opinions upon the subject of duelling are equally well known .
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.128

I consider the duello , or personal combat <font> a l'outrance <$$font>
, one of the grandest institutions of civilized society .
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.129

Two gentlemen are fairly brought face to face , weapon to weapon . The
sun and wind equally divided , no secret armour allowed , no undue
advantage permitted . PLANCHE-1846-2,8.130

There@ @'s nae risk o' a random shot , or a chance blow from some
mercenary soldier , which i' the confusion o' battle has cut short the
career o' many a gallant officer - PLANCHE-1846-2,8.131

a' depends upon your ain courage , your ain skill ; PLANCHE-1846-2,8.132

you attack , defend , according to established rules ,
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.133

and kill your antagonist PLANCHE-1846-2,8.134

or fall yourself {TEXT:yoursel} , like a man of honour and gude breeding
. PLANCHE-1846-2,8.135

<font> Went. <$$font> It@ @'s a pity , laird , that you can@ @not
convert his majesty to your opinion . PLANCHE-1846-2,8.136

His objection to duelling renders an appeal to arms almost as fatal to
the victors as the vanquished . <font> Orm. <$$font> And the loss of
one's right hand a certainty , if but a blow be struck within the
precincts of the palace . PLANCHE-1846-2,8.137

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh , we@ @'ve fallen upon degenerate days ,
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.138

that@ @'s the truth of it : PLANCHE-1846-2,8.139

there@ @'s no spirit , no fight in us ! <font> Nor. <$$font> For which
reason you had all but crossed swords with Wentworth , on this spot , a
few minutes ago , for a mere jest . PLANCHE-1846-2,8.140

<font> Kil. <$$font> Ah , indeed ! PLANCHE-1846-2,8.141

Well , well , PLANCHE-1846-2,8.142

but see you me now , gentlemen , PLANCHE-1846-2,8.143

if the affair is not settled , perhaps a meeting might yet be arranged ,
that - PLANCHE-1846-2,8.144

<font> Orm. <$$font> But it is settled - quite settled :
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.145

they have shaken hands , PLANCHE-1846-2,8.146

no offence was intended . PLANCHE-1846-2,8.147

<font> Hec. <$$font> Yes , you@ @'re a little too late , major .
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.148

The lieutenant <P_9> and I are only going to challenge one another to a

<font> Nor. <$$font> Let@ @'s drink {COM:missing_preposition} the

Killiecrankie will join us in doing honour to that toast , I@ @'m sure !

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh , the ladies , by all means ; and the
ladies-in-waiting on her gracious majesty , in particular !
PLANCHE-1846-2,9.153

Such a regiment of beauties never marched under royal colors .

Ould King Charles's was nothing to 'em . PLANCHE-1846-2,9.155

<font> Ara. <$$font> I am , PLANCHE-1846-2,10.201

I am . PLANCHE-1846-2,10.202

<font> Lucy . <$$font> It is quite true ; PLANCHE-1846-2,10.204

I was present : PLANCHE-1846-2,10.205

but surely you were aware of that intention . PLANCHE-1846-2,10.206

<font> Ara. <$$font> Her majesty has certainly , on more than one
occasion , lately , hinted to me her wishes on that subject ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,10.207

but I was in hopes my evident repugnance would have induced her to have
abandoned the idea . PLANCHE-1846-2,10.208

<font> Lucy . <$$font> Certainly not , then ; PLANCHE-1846-2,10.209

for she spoke of it as a matter arranged , and immediately to take place

Why , you will be Duchess of Villa Hermosa , and wife of one of the

You@ @'ll ride in a carriage drawn by eight mules , and see your husband

<font> Ara. <$$font> I tremble to name him ; PLANCHE-1846-2,11.225

but you shall - you must - know all . PLANCHE-1846-2,11.226

Four months ago , sitting in an arbour , in the gardens yonder , with
Signora Maria , the young Italian lady who came over with the queen -
<font> Lucy . <$$font> And has just taken the veil in the convent of
Saint Paul at Milan . PLANCHE-1846-2,11.227

I know . PLANCHE-1846-2,11.228

<font> Ara. <$$font> We were talking of her intended profession .
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.229

She was expatiating on the happiness of becoming the " bride of heaven ,
" as she termed it . PLANCHE-1846-2,11.230

<font> Lucy . <$$font> And you naturally recorded your opinion in favor
of an earthly bridegroom to begin with . PLANCHE-1846-2,11.231

<font> Ara. <$$font> I acknowledged that I entertained a secret
affection for a gentleman in the service of his majesty ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.232

and , by the most unfortunate accident , my confession was overheard .
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.233

<font> Lucy . <$$font> By some stranger ? PLANCHE-1846-2,11.234

<font> Ara. <$$font> Alas , no ! by the gentleman himself .
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.235

<font> Lucy . <$$font> Unfortunate ! PLANCHE-1846-2,11.236

why , my dear , no accident could be more fortunate .
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.237

It saved a world of trouble to both of you - that is , if the gentleman
was as much smitten as yourself . PLANCHE-1846-2,11.238

<font> Ara. <$$font> Oh , of his love I am certain .
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.239

That very evening he wrote to acknowledge his fault , request my pardon
, and assure me of his eternal devotion . PLANCHE-1846-2,11.240

<font> Lucy . <$$font> That evening ! PLANCHE-1846-2,11.241

- what ! - did the fellow wait till the evening ?
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.242

did he not , on the instant , fall at your feet , in a convulsion of
happiness and gratitude . PLANCHE-1846-2,11.243

<font> Ara. <$$font> Oh , no ! he acted with more delicacy and
discretion . PLANCHE-1846-2,11.244

He knew the necessity of secrecy - the obstacles to be surmounted ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.245

and therefore requested but to be allowed to adore me in silence - to
continue to hope ; {TEXT:colon} PLANCHE-1846-2,11.246

and , in order to prevent even a suspicion of our mutual affection , he
proposed that we should avoid meeting each other as much as possible -
and , when we could not avoid it , meet as utter strangers , without
exchanging even a glance which might betray us {COM:missing_period}
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.247

<font> Lucy . <$$font> And do you mean to say that you have never once
met him alone - that he has never obtained a private interview ?
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.248

<font> Ara. <$$font> Never . PLANCHE-1846-2,11.249

He writes to me daily - PLANCHE-1846-2,11.250

contrives by some mysterious agency to convey to me the most passionate
, and at the same time the most respectful letters ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.251

but if we meet by accident , in the palace or the gardens , he either
passes me quickly without a look , PLANCHE-1846-2,11.252

or turns suddenly round PLANCHE-1846-2,11.253

and disappears as soon as possible . PLANCHE-1846-2,11.254

<P_12>

<font> Lucy . <$$font> Well , that is being rather more delicate and
discreet than I should think agreeable under the circumstances ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.256

but you were always an oddity , my dear , PLANCHE-1846-2,12.257

and the young gentleman seems an admirable match for you , as far as
singularity goes . PLANCHE-1846-2,12.258

What did you say his name was ? PLANCHE-1846-2,12.259

<font> Ara. <$$font> I have never yet named him to you , Lucy .
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.260

<font> Lucy . <$$font> But you did to the signora .
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.261

Are you going to treat me with less confidence ? PLANCHE-1846-2,12.262

<font> Ara. <$$font> No ; for it is necessary you should be fully
acquainted with my position ; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.263

how else could you aid me ? PLANCHE-1846-2,12.264

The person in question is Henry Ormonde . PLANCHE-1846-2,12.265

<font> Lucy . <$$font> Ormonde ! - the shy , handsome lieutenant in
the Life Guards . PLANCHE-1846-2,12.266

Upon my word , he@ @'s a lucky fellow to have entrapped your confession
; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.267

for I@ @'m sure he@ @'d never have had courage to declare himself :
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.268

but do@ @n't fancy his delicacy and discretion so exceedingly personal ,
my love ; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.269

for he runs away from petticoats in general , as if they had all got the
remains of the great plague ; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.270

and looks as red , if spoken to by a woman , as if he were gazing on
Paul's church during the great fire ! PLANCHE-1846-2,12.271

And so he writes to you daily , does he ? PLANCHE-1846-2,12.272

And , pray , what would be the consequence if any portion of your
correspondence fell into the hands of the queen . PLANCHE-1846-2,12.273

<font> Ara. <$$font> Ruin , my dear - utter ruin - if they could be
traced to either of us . PLANCHE-1846-2,12.274

But his letters are never signed ; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.275

and I have written but one to him , PLANCHE-1846-2,12.276

and that one contained but two words - <font> Patience <$$font> and
<font> Hope <$$font> - without either signature or direction .
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.277

<font> Lucy . <$$font> The sweetest words that ever lover starved upon
; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.278

and now , in two other words , equally clear and easy to remember , tell
me how I can serve you ? PLANCHE-1846-2,12.279

<font> Ara. <$$font> Read that note , PLANCHE-1846-2,12.280

and tell me what I shall do . PLANCHE-1846-2,12.281

<font> Lucy . <$$font> <bracket> <font> Reads <$$font> <$$bracket> "
The queen has formally announced your speedy union with the Duke of
Villa Hermosa ; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.282

time to grant me a moment's audience . PLANCHE-1846-2,12.283

To-night , as the clock strikes eleven , I will be in Queen Mary's Bower
. PLANCHE-1846-2,12.284

If you come not I shall deem all hope is over , PLANCHE-1846-2,12.285

supportable . " PLANCHE-1846-2,12.286

Humph . PLANCHE-1846-2,12.287

<font> Ara. <$$font> Well , Lucy . PLANCHE-1846-2,12.288

<font> Lucy . <$$font> Well , my dear , you must go : not that I think
the poor dear gentleman would kill himself if you did@ @n't ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.289

but he might kill somebody else , or do something equally foolish -
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.290

and if you are both really so deep in love as you appear to be , why ,
at the worst , you can only marry and live <P_13> unhappily

They ca@ @n't hang either of you for that you know .

<font> Lucy . <$$font> You shall not be alone : PLANCHE-1846-2,13.294

I will go with you . <font> Ara <$$font> And risk the displeasure of
the queen - the chance of compromising your own reputation .
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.295

No , Lucy , I can@ @not accept this too generous offer .
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.296

<font> Lucy . <$$font> You must : PLANCHE-1846-2,13.297

you have placed your case in my hands , PLANCHE-1846-2,13.298

and have no discretionary power . PLANCHE-1846-2,13.299

Come , PLANCHE-1846-2,13.300

it is nearly dusk already , and time for us to enter the Palace .
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.301

We are neither of us in attendance this evening , PLANCHE-1846-2,13.302

and may therefore steal out unnoticed . PLANCHE-1846-2,13.303

<font> Ara. <$$font> Stay , PLANCHE-1846-2,13.304

who is that yonder ? PLANCHE-1846-2,13.305

<font> Lucy . <$$font> Oh ! Captain O'Donoghue - a devoted admirer of
mine - and of forty others , I have no doubt ; an agreeable , rattling
young Irishman , who has got a heart , I verily believe - somewhere ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.306

but he is always losing , or rather mislaying it : PLANCHE-1846-2,13.307

<font> Lucy . <$$font> Oh , half_a_dozen times . PLANCHE-1846-2,13.310

He had the impudence this morning to run away with one of my gloves ,
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.311

and vowed , before I know not how many people , he would never give it
me back , till I promised him the hand it belonged to .
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.312

<font> Ara. <$$font> And but for the people you would have promised him

<font> Kil. <$$font> But hear you me , now , my dear young friend :
PLANCHE-1846-2,14.347

it was perfectly unavoidable . PLANCHE-1846-2,14.348

<font> Orm. <$$font> Pardon me , major - PLANCHE-1846-2,14.349

it was not unavoidable . PLANCHE-1846-2,14.350

He was evidently flushed with wine ; PLANCHE-1846-2,14.351

and , but for your interference the matter might have passed without
notice . PLANCHE-1846-2,14.352

<font> Kil. <$$font> Without notice ! PLANCHE-1846-2,14.353

A fellow like that take precedence of an officer of His Majesty's Life
Guards , PLANCHE-1846-2,14.354

and you are to pass it without notice ! PLANCHE-1846-2,14.355

Lieutenant Ormonde , I promised your deceased father - my dear friend
and brother-officer - that I would watch over the honour o' his son ,
PLANCHE-1846-2,14.356

and when that honour is implicated - PLANCHE-1846-2,14.357

<font> Orm. <$$font> Honour ! PLANCHE-1846-2,14.358

- what honour is to be gained by a quarrel with such a man as Barnwell ,
a dissipated hanger-on of Sunderland's - a reputed spy - but just enough
of a gentleman by birth to prevent my refusing to meet him .
PLANCHE-1846-2,14.359

As for my life , heaven knows , were I about to risk it in the field of
battle - or in a conflict with any worthy adversary , in a good <P_15>
cause - it would give me little uneasiness . PLANCHE-1846-2,15.360

Were it now the Duke of Villa Hermosa - PLANCHE-1846-2,15.361

The duke - PLANCHE-1846-2,15.364

but nae matter . PLANCHE-1846-2,15.365

If he have offended you , my dear friend , I shall be proud to wait on
him in your name , PLANCHE-1846-2,15.366

Although of the younger branch , your family is one o' the best in
England PLANCHE-1846-2,15.367

and he can@ @na' refuse . PLANCHE-1846-2,15.368

<font> Orm. <$$font> My dear major , I never saw the duke in my life ,
PLANCHE-1846-2,15.369

and he , most probably , is not aware even of my existence .
PLANCHE-1846-2,15.370

He is , therefore , perfectly innocent of any offence to me .
PLANCHE-1846-2,15.371

<font> Kil. <$$font> Then wherefore single him out , wi' such
remarkable expression ? PLANCHE-1846-2,15.372

<font> Orm. <$$font> No matter , PLANCHE-1846-2,15.373

that is my secret ; PLANCHE-1846-2,15.374

and if Barnwell is sober enough by six o'clock to-morrow morning to kill
me , that secret will die with me . PLANCHE-1846-2,15.375

You have settled the place , I presume , as well as the time ?
PLANCHE-1846-2,15.376

<font> Kil. <$$font> Aye , aye , in the meadows , south o' the river -
PLANCHE-1846-2,15.377

PLANCHE-1846-2,17.486

PLANCHE-1846-2,17.487

There was a hole through his body big enough to let out as many lives as

<font> Orm. <$$font> Most singular ! PLANCHE-1846-2,17.489

Had he an affair upon his hands then , when our altercation took place ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.490

<font> Orm. <$$font> How know you that , if you know not who did it ?
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.494

<font> Kil. <$$font> The host of The Toy says that he was unco fu' when

<font> Orm. <$$font> Certainly , PLANCHE-1846-2,17.497

for I named it at the time , as a reason for not taking offence at his
madness . PLANCHE-1846-2,17.498

The wretched man , doubtless insulted some passing stranger , who took
immediate vengeance upon him . <font> Kil. <$$font> And prevented your

PLANCHE-1846-2,17.499

Well , well , you must bear your disappointment like a man , Ormonde .

<font> Orm. <$$font> Nay , nay - 't@ @is neither the money , nor the

<font> Orm. <$$font> But I am in love , Hector ! Deeply , desperately
in love , PLANCHE-1846-2,20.559

and it was to consult you on the subject that I sent for you .
PLANCHE-1846-2,20.560

<font> Hec. <$$font> The devil you are ! PLANCHE-1846-2,20.561

And since when , I@ @'d be glad to know ? PLANCHE-1846-2,20.562

For you gave me your honour , last night , that you had@ @n't a lady to

<font> Orm. <$$font> Nor had I , then ; PLANCHE-1846-2,20.564

nor have I , even now , a right to quarrel for her - perhaps not even to
name her - PLANCHE-1846-2,20.565

for she is ignorant of my love ; PLANCHE-1846-2,20.566

but I have long adored her , although so utterly hopeless did I consider
my passion , that I scarcely avowed it even to myself .
PLANCHE-1846-2,20.567

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh , ye equivocating villain ! ar@ @n't you
ashamed of yourself - to have deceived your best friend in this fashion

<font> Orm. <$$font> My dear Hector , you will never need to blush for
your own want of confidence . PLANCHE-1846-2,20.569

Had I but a tithe part of your confidence , I should have declared
myself to the lady long ago . PLANCHE-1846-2,20.570

<font> Hec. <$$font> And who is the lady , after all ?
PLANCHE-1846-2,20.571

<font> Orm. <$$font> One whom you know well , at least by sight .
PLANCHE-1846-2,20.572

distant glimpse of that form , which I dared not approach , lest an
uncontrollable glance should have revealed the secret of my soul .
PLANCHE-1846-2,21.586

Oh , the pangs which wrung my heart , when I heard that the queen had
declared her intention to give that matchless creature in marriage to
the Duke of Villa Hermosa : PLANCHE-1846-2,21.587

for though I felt the impossibility of her being mine , I had not
philosophy enough to contemplate the prospect of another's triumph !
PLANCHE-1846-2,21.588

But now , now my friend , I may boldly enter the lists and dispute the
prize , even with the duke . PLANCHE-1846-2,21.589

No longer a poor lieutenant of horse , my title , my fortune , authorize
my pretensions ; PLANCHE-1846-2,21.590

<font> Orm. <$$font> Oh , do not , I beseech you , destroy my new-born
hopes , by so fatal a suspicion . PLANCHE-1846-2,21.595

I have watched with all the Argus-eyed vigilance of a doting lover , too
prone to conjure up a rival in every shadow ; PLANCHE-1846-2,21.596

<font> Lucy . <$$font> Safe and at liberty . PLANCHE-1846-2,27.838

Be calm - PLANCHE-1846-2,27.839

Captain O'Donoghue has just sent me word , the man who killed Barnwell
has been taken . PLANCHE-1846-2,27.840

He is one of Monmouth's adherents , PLANCHE-1846-2,27.841

and has been in hiding since the battle of Sedgmoor -
PLANCHE-1846-2,27.842

having been suddenly met and recognised by Barnwell , who he knew would
denounce him - he drew upon him PLANCHE-1846-2,27.843

and slew him - PLANCHE-1846-2,27.844

<font> Ara. <$$font> And the letter - the charge of treason ?
PLANCHE-1846-2,27.845

<font> Lucy . <$$font> It was his cousin , the late marquis , to whom
the passage alluded . PLANCHE-1846-2,27.846

It appears he was in secret correspondence with all the leaders of the
rebellion . PLANCHE-1846-2,27.847

The king himself has signified his perfect confidence in the loyalty of
Lord Elrington , and promised to obtain her majesty's consent to your
marriage - PLANCHE-1846-2,27.848

so you see , dearest Arabella , instead of the terrible tragedy you
expected , the affair will turn out a comedy , and end as all comedies
should do , with a wedding . PLANCHE-1846-2,27.849

<font> Ara. <$$font> How shall I ever repay you for your noble
friendship - your generous defence of me , to the queen , to the whole
court PLANCHE-1846-2,27.850

<font> Lucy . <$$font> My dear creature , it was my defence as much as
yours . PLANCHE-1846-2,27.851

I was the person who advised your meeting the young gentleman , and had
a right to share any disgrace that could fall upon you in consequence .
PLANCHE-1846-2,27.852

As it happens , your lover would have been acquitted without our
extremely handsome offer to prove an <font> alibi . <$$font>
PLANCHE-1846-2,27.853

But it has caused such fine gossip in the palace , and scandalized so
many malicious old maids , who can get no assignations at all , that it
would have been a_thousand pities not to have made it .
PLANCHE-1846-2,27.854

<P_28>

<font> Ara. <$$font> Dear Lucy . PLANCHE-1846-2,28.856

<font> Lucy . <$$font> Besides there@ @'s an end of the Duke of Villa
Hermosa and his two_and_thirty quarters . PLANCHE-1846-2,28.857

His grandeeship can never think of marrying a young lady , who has been
guilty of so shocking a piece of indecrorum . PLANCHE-1846-2,28.858

<font> Ara. <$$font> Alas , may not Lord Elrington himself hesitate to
marry one who has been made the subject of so much animadversion - even
though on his account ? PLANCHE-1846-2,28.859

<font> Lucy . <$$font> It would be like his horrid sex . I grant -
PLANCHE-1846-2,28.860

but I think better of Henry Ormonde . PLANCHE-1846-2,28.861

Should he , however , prove such a man-monster , I@ @'ll marry that old
Highland scarecrow , Major Killi_what_d'ye_call_him , on the special

PLANCHE-1846-2,28.862

and he@ @'ll do it at that price I know ; PLANCHE-1846-2,28.863

PLANCHE-1846-2,28.882

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> , P. PLANCHE-1846-2,28.883

<font> Orm. <$$font> Not here ! PLANCHE-1846-2,28.884

Another moment to nerve myself for this interview , upon the result of
which all my hopes of happiness depend . PLANCHE-1846-2,28.885

She may , she surely will explain this <P_29> mystery , which I have
vainly tortured my brain to unravel {COM:missing_period}
PLANCHE-1846-2,29.886

That she loves me , has long known , and returned my affection , has
become a matter of notoriety to the whole court . PLANCHE-1846-2,29.887

That her love prompted the astonishing declaration which she made
yesterday , may yet be possible . PLANCHE-1846-2,29.888

That Miss Desvorough's generous friendship induced her to support that
assertion , may be equally so . PLANCHE-1846-2,29.889

But if , as I can@ @not help fearing , some deception has been practised
on her , there is as much danger to her happiness in unmasking it , as
to mine in the cruel conviction ! PLANCHE-1846-2,29.890

Heaven grant me coolness enough to question without alarming her -
PLANCHE-1846-2,29.891

she comes ! PLANCHE-1846-2,29.892

<font> Enter <$$font> Arabella , R. PLANCHE-1846-2,29.893

<font> Ara. <$$font> My lord ! <bracket> <font> timidly , and then
with a burst of feeling . <$$font> <$$bracket> Henry , my dearest Henry
, - blessed be providence you are safe ! PLANCHE-1846-2,29.894

<font> Orm. <$$font> In what words can I express my rapture , my
gratitude , for such unexampled proofs of your affection ! How , at the
same time , convey to you an idea of what I have suffered , what I still
suffer at the recollection of the sacrifice you have made for me .
PLANCHE-1846-2,29.895

<font> Ara. <$$font> What sacrifice ? PLANCHE-1846-2,29.896

The favor of the queen ? PLANCHE-1846-2,29.897

His majesty has graciously offered his mediation - PLANCHE-1846-2,29.898

a marriage with a foreign nobleman , whom I have never seen , and could
never love ; you will not call that a sacrifice ? PLANCHE-1846-2,29.899

<font> Orm. <$$font> But your name , Arabella - your fair name to be
made the bye-word of the court . The title of a_hundred absurd and
scandalous stories ; your conduct censured , your honor , perhaps ,
called in question . PLANCHE-1846-2,29.900

<font> Ara. <$$font> If <font> you <$$font> do not question it - if
<font> you <$$font> do not censure my conduct , what care I for the
world . PLANCHE-1846-2,29.901

Was I to stand calmly by , hear you accused of the most dreadful crime ;
see your life in peril , and not speak the words could save you , and
those words the truth ! PLANCHE-1846-2,29.902

<font> Orm. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> The
truth ! PLANCHE-1846-2,29.903

<font> Ara. <$$font> Had I not even loved you as I do , could I have
offered you to perish , when it was in my power so clearly to prove your
innocence ? PLANCHE-1846-2,29.904

<font> Orm. <$$font> And had your testimony been needed , you would not
have hesitated , in a public court of justice , to have confirmed it by
a sacred oath ! PLANCHE-1846-2,29.905

<font> Ara. <$$font> Assuredly not - PLANCHE-1846-2,29.906

nor my dear friend , Miss Desborough , by whose advice I consented to
the meeting so urgently {COM:word_partly_missing} requested in your note
{TEXT:vote} . PLANCHE-1846-2,29.907

<P_30>

<font> Orm. <$$font> My note ! PLANCHE-1846-2,30.909

Hah , well thought of ! PLANCHE-1846-2,30.910

Let me see that note . PLANCHE-1846-2,30.911

I - PLANCHE-1846-2,30.912

<font> Ara. <$$font> I have destroyed it . PLANCHE-1846-2,30.913

<font> Orm. <$$font> Destroyed it . PLANCHE-1846-2,30.914

<font> Ara <$$font> Certainly , as I have all your other letters , by
your own request . PLANCHE-1846-2,30.915

Indeed , common prudence would have induced me . PLANCHE-1846-2,30.916

Had one of them fallen into the hands of her majesty , altho' unsigned -
<font> Orm. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket>
Unsigned ! <font> Ara. <$$font> They might have led to the discovery
of the writer <font> PLANCHE-1846-2,30.917

Orm. <$$font> True , they might . PLANCHE-1846-2,30.918

<bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> And that clue is denied
me ! PLANCHE-1846-2,30.919

<font> Ara. <$$font> And from the moment when accident wafted to your
ear my unguarded confession - to that of our first and only secret
meeting in Queen Mary's Bower - <font> Orm. <$$font> <bracket> <font>
Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> First and only - <font> Ara. <$$font> I
have trembled lest a look , or a word , should escape either of us ,
which might awake suspicion ; PLANCHE-1846-2,30.920

for you were then a poor lieutenant , without fortune , without
influence , at the mercy of those whose anger could and would have
crushed you . PLANCHE-1846-2,30.921

You are now an independent {TEXT:indepeendnt} nobleman
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.922

and can justify your pretension ; PLANCHE-1846-2,30.923

but do not forget , Henry , it was whilst you were poor and friendless
that Arabella first saw and loved you - PLANCHE-1846-2,30.924

and believe me , that when startled by your manner the other night , I
broke from your arms , {TEXT:.} it was in sorrow , more than anger , and
because I felt I had more to fear from my own heart than from yours .
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.925

<font> Orm. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> It
is too plain ; PLANCHE-1846-2,30.926

my worst suspicions are verified ! PLANCHE-1846-2,30.927

What villain - what base , treacherous villain ! PLANCHE-1846-2,30.928

<font> Ara. <$$font> Henry , you are moved , distressed .
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.929

There is no cause , PLANCHE-1846-2,30.930

I have forgiven you - PLANCHE-1846-2,30.931

nay , was to blame myself , perhaps - too hasty , too severe .
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.932

<font> Orm. <$$font> No , no , no , you are the noblest of your sex ,
as in my sight you are the fairest . PLANCHE-1846-2,30.933

The wretch that could tamper with such a heart as yours , should be torn
piece meal . PLANCHE-1846-2,30.934

An honest sword would be for ever tarnished with his blood .
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.935

<font> Ara. {TEXT:Ora.} <$$font> Henry , you terrify me !
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.936

Who should tamper with me ? PLANCHE-1846-2,30.937

<font> Orm. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Kneels . <$$font> <$$bracket>
Not I , not I ; PLANCHE-1846-2,30.938

at your feet , Arabella , I swear eternal fidelity to you , and
vengeance upon any who shall dare to breathe a whisper to your prejudice
! PLANCHE-1846-2,30.939

<bracket> <font> Rises . <$$font> <$$bracket> Farewell ! but for a
short time , PLANCHE-1846-2,30.940

I will return to claim you with the sanction of the queen ,
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.941

and will devote my life to the repayment of your love , and the
vindication of your honor . <bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> Ormonde ,
{COM:word_missing} PLANCHE-1846-2,30.942

<font> Ara. <$$font> Happy , happy Arabella . PLANCHE-1846-2,30.943
