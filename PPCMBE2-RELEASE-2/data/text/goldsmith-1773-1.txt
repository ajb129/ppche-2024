Act II . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.4

Scene , <font> An old-fashioned <$$font> House . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.5

<$$heading>

<font> Enter <$$font> Hardcastle , <font> followed by three or four
awkward Servants . <$$font> GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.7

Hardcastle . Well , I hope you@ @'re perfect in the table exercise I
have been teaching you these three days . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.8

You all know your posts and your places , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.9

and can shew that you have been used to good company , without ever
stirring from home . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.10

Omnes . Ay , ay . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.11

Hardcastle . When company comes you are not to pop out and stare , and
then run in again , like frightened rabbits in a warren .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.12

Omnes . No , no . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.13

Hardcastle . You , Diggory , whom I have taken from the barn , are to
make a show at the side-table ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.14

and you , Roger , whom I have advanced from the plough , are to place
yourself behind <font> my <$$font> chair . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.15

But you@ @'re not to stand so , with your hands in your pockets .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.16

Take your hands from your pockets , Roger ; and from your head , you
blockhead you . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.17

See how Diggory carries his hands . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.18

They@ @'re a little too stiff , indeed , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.19

but that@ @'s no great matter . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.20

Diggory . Ay , mind how I hold them . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.21

I learned to hold my hands this way when I was upon drill for the
militia . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.22

And so being upon drill - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.23

Hardcastle . You must not be so talkative , Diggory .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.24

You must be all attention to the guests . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,17.25

You must hear us talk , <P_18> and not think of talking ;
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.26

you must see us drink , and not think of drinking ;
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.27

you must see us eat , and not think of eating . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.28

Diggory . By the laws , your worship , that@ @'s parfectly unpossible .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.29

Whenever Diggory sees yeating going forward , ecod he@ @'s always
wishing for a mouthful himself . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.30

Hardcastle . Blockhead ! Is not a belly-full in the kitchen as good as
a belly-full in the parlour ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.31

Stay your stomach with that reflection . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.32

Diggory . Ecod I thank your worship , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.33

I@ @'ll make a shift to stay my stomach with a slice of cold beef in the
pantry . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.34

Hardcastle . Diggory , you are too talkative . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.35

Then if I happen to say a good thing , or tell a good story at table ,
you must not all burst out a-laughing , as if you made part of the
company . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.36

Diggory . Then ecod your worship must not tell the story of Ould Grouse
in the gun-room : GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.37

I ca@ @n't help laughing at that - he ! he ! he ! - for the soul of
me . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.38

We have laughed at that these twenty years - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.39

ha ! ha ! ha ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.40

Hardcastle . Ha ! ha ! ha ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.41

The story is a good one . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.42

Well , honest Diggory , you may laugh at that - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.43

but still remember to be attentive . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.44

Suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine ,
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.45

how will you behave ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.46

A glass of wine , sir , if you please <paren> <font> to Diggory <$$font>
<$$paren> - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.47

Eh , why do@ @n't you move ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.48

Diggory . Ecod , your worship , I never have courage till I see the
eatables and drinkables brought upo' the table , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.49

and then I@ @'m as bauld as a lion . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.50

Hardcastle . What , will nobody move ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.51

First Servant . I@ @'m not to leave this pleace .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,18.52

<P_19>

Second Servant . I@ @'m sure it@ @'s no pleace of mine .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.54

Third Servant . Nor mine , for sartain . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.55

Diggory . Wauns , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.56

and I@ @'m sure it can@ @na be mine . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.57

Hardcastle . You numskulls ! and so while , like your betters , you
are quarrelling for places , the guests must be starved .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.58

O you dunces ! I find I must begin all over again .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.59

- But do@ @n't I hear a coach drive into the yard ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.60

To your posts , you blockheads . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.61

I@ @'ll go in the mean time and give my old friend's son a hearty
reception at the gate . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.62

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> Hardcastle . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.63

Diggory . By the elevens , my pleace is gone quite out of my head .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.64

Roger . I know that my place {TEXT:pleace} is to be everywhere .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.65

First Servant . Where the devil is mine ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.66

Second Servant . My pleace is to be nowhere at all ;
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.67

and so I@ @ze go about my business . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.68

<bracket> <font> Exeunt Servants , running about as if frighted ,
different ways . <$$font> GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.69

<font> Enter <$$font> Servant <font> with candles , showing in <$$font>
Marlow <font> and <$$font> Hastings . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.70

Servant . Welcome , gentlemen , very welcome ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.71

This way . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.72

Hastings . After the disappointments of the day , welcome once more ,
Charles , to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.73

Upon my word , a very well looking house ; antique , but creditable .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.74

Marlow . The usual fate of a large mansion . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.75

Having first ruined the master by good housekeeping , it at last comes
to levy contributions as an inn . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,19.76

<P_20>

Hastings . As you say , we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these
fineries . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.78

I have often seen a good sideboard , or a marble chimney-piece , tho'
not actually put in the bill , enflame a reckoning confoundedly .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.79

Marlow . Travellers , George , must pay in all places .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.80

The only difference is , that in good inns you pay dearly for luxuries ;
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.81

in bad inns , you are fleeced and starved . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.82

Hastings . You have lived very much among them .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.83

In truth , I have been often surprized , that you who have seen so much
of the world , with your natural good sense , and your many
opportunities , could never yet acquire a requisite share of assurance .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.84

Marlow . The Englishman's malady . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.85

But tell me , George , where could I have learned that assurance you
talk of ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.86

My life has been chiefly spent in a college , or an inn , in seclusion
from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence
. GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.87

I do@ @n't know that I was ever familiarly acquainted with a single
modest woman - except my mother - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.88

But among females of another class you know - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.89

Hastings . Ay , among them you are impudent enough of all conscience .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.90

Marlow . They are of <font> us <$$font> you know .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.91

Hastings . But in the company of women of reputation I never saw such
an idiot , such a trembler ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.92

you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of stealing
out of the room . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.93

Marlow . Why man that@ @'s because I <font> do <$$font> want to steal
out of the room . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,20.94

Faith , I have often formed <P_21> a resolution to break the ice , and
rattle away at any rate . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.95

But I do@ @n't know how , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.96

a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my
resolution . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.97

An impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.98

but I@ @'ll be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.99

Hastings . If you could but say half the fine things to them that I
have heard you lavish upon the bar-maid of an inn , or even a college
bed maker - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.100

Marlow . Why , George , I ca@ @n't say fine things to them ,
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.101

They freeze , they petrify me . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.102

They may talk of a comet , or a burning mountain , or some such
bagatelle . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.103

But , to me , a modest woman , drest out in all her finery , is the most
tremendous object of the whole creation . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.104

Hastings . Ha ! ha ! ha ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.105

At this rate , man , how can you ever expect to marry ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.106

Marlow . Never , unless as among kings and princes , my bride were to
be courted by proxy . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.107

If , indeed , like an Eastern bridegroom , one were to be introduced to
a wife he never saw before , it might be endured .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.108

But to go through all the terrors of a formal courtship , together with
the episode of aunts , grandmothers , and cousins , and at last to blurt
out the broad staring question of , <font> madam , will you marry me ?
<$$font> No , no , that@ @'s a strain much above me I assure you .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.109

Hastings . I pity you . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.110

But how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at
the request of your father ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.111

Marlow . As I behave to all other ladies . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.112

Bow very low , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.113

answer yes or no to all her demands - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,21.114

But for <P_22> the rest , I do@ @n't think I shall venture to look in
her face till I see my father's again . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.115

Hastings . I@ @'m surprized that one who is so warm a friend can be so
cool a lover . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.116

Marlow . To be explicit , my dear Hastings , my chief inducement down
was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness , not my own .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.117

Miss Neville loves you , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.118

the family do@ @n't know you , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.119

as my friend you are sure of a reception , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.120

and let honour do the rest . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.121

Hastings . My dear Marlow ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.122

But I@ @'ll suppress the emotion . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.123

Were I a wretch , meanly seeking to carry off a fortune , you should be
the last man in the world I would apply to for assistance .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.124

But Miss Neville's person is all I ask , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.125

and that is mine , both from her deceased father's consent , and her own
inclination . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.126

Marlow . Happy man ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.127

You have talents and art to captivate any woman .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.128

I@ @'m doom'd to adore the sex , and yet to converse with the only part
of it I despise . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.129

This stammer in my address , and this awkward prepossessing visage of
mine , can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliner's
'prentice , or one of the duchesses of Drury-lane .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.130

Pshaw ! this fellow here to interrupt us . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.131

<font> Enter <$$font> Hardcastle . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.132

Hardcastle . Gentlemen , once more you are heartily welcome .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.133

Which is Mr. Marlow ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.134

Sir , you@ @'re heartily welcome . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.135

It@ @'s not my way , you see , to receive my friends with my back to the
fire . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.136

I like to give them a hearty reception in the old stile at my gate .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.137

I like to see their horses and trunks taken care of .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.138

Marlow . <paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> He has got our names
from the servants already . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,22.139

<P_23>

<paren> <font> To Him <$$font> <$$paren> We approve your caution and
hospitality , Sir . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.141

<paren> <font> To Hastings <$$font> <$$paren> I have been thinking ,
George , of changing our travelling dresses in the morning .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.142

I am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.143

Hardcastle . I beg , Mr. Marlow , you@ @'ll use no ceremony in this
house . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.144

Hastings . I fancy , George , you@ @'re right : GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.145

the first blow is half the battle . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.146

I intend opening the campaign with the white and gold .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.147

Hardcastle . Mr. Marlow - Mr. Hastings - gentlemen - pray be under no
constraint in this house . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.148

This is Liberty-hall , gentlemen . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.149

You may do just as you please here . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.150

Marlow . Yet , George , if we open the campaign too fiercely at first ,
we may want ammunition before it is over . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.151

I think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.152

Hardcastle . Your talking of a retreat , Mr. Marlow , puts me in mind
of the Duke of Marlborough , when we went to besiege Denain .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.153

He first summoned the garrison . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.154

Marlow . Do@ @n't you think the <font> ventre dor <$$font> waistcoat
will do with the plain brown ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.155

Hardcastle . He first summoned the garrison , which might consist of
about five_thousand men - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.156

Hastings . I think not : GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.157

Brown and yellow mix but very poorly . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.158

Hardcastle . I say , gentlemen , as I was telling you , he summoned the
garrison , which might consist of about five_thousand men -
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.159

Marlow . The girls like finery . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,23.160

<P_24>

Hardcastle . Which might consist of about five_thousand men , well
appointed with stores , ammunition , and other implements of war .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.162

Now , says the Duke of Marlborough to George Brooks , that stood next to
him - you must have heard of George Brooks - I@ @'ll pawn my Dukedom ,
says he , but I take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.163

So - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.164

Marlow . What , my good friend , if you gave us a glass of punch in the
mean time , it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.165

Hardcastle . Punch , sir ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.166

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> This is the most unaccountable
kind of modesty I ever met with . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.167

Marlow . Yes , Sir , Punch . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.168

A glass of warm punch , after our journey , will be comfortable .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.169

This is Liberty-Hall , you know . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.170

Hardcastle . Here@ @'s Cup , Sir . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.171

Marlow . <paren> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$paren> So this fellow , in
his Liberty-hall , will only let us have just what he pleases .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.172

Hardcastle . <paren> <font> Taking the Cup <$$font> <$$paren> I hope
you@ @'ll find it to your mind . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.173

I have prepared it with my own hands , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.174

and I believe you@ @'ll own the ingredients are tolerable .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.175

Will you be so good as to pledge me , Sir ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.176

Here , Mr. Marlow , here is to our better acquaintance .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.177

<bracket> <font> drinks . <$$font> GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.178

Marlow . <paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> A very impudent fellow
this ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.179

but he@ @'s a character , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.180

and I@ @'ll humour him a little . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.181

Sir , my service to you . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.182

<paren> <font> drinks <$$font> <$$paren> GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.183

Hastings . <paren> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$paren> I see this fellow
wants to give us his company , and forgets that he@ @'s an innkeeper ,
before he has learned to be a gentleman . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,24.184

<P_25>

Marlow . From the excellence of your cup , my old friend , I suppose
you have a good deal of business in this part of the country .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.186

Warm work , now and then , at elections , I suppose .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.187

Hardcastle . No , sir , I have long given that work over .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.188

Since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other ,
there is no business <font> for us that sell ale . <$$font>
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.189

Hastings . So , then , you have no turn for politics I find .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.190

Hardcastle . Not in the least . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.191

There was a time , indeed , I fretted myself about the mistakes of
government , like other people ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.192

but finding myself every day grow more angry , and the government
growing no better , I left it to mend itself . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.193

Since that , I no more trouble my head about <font> Hyder Ally <$$font>
, or <font> Ally Cawn <$$font> , than about <font> Ally Croker <$$font>
. GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.194

Sir , my service to you . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.195

Hastings . So that with eating above stairs , and drinking below , with
receiving your friends within , and amusing them without , you lead a
good pleasant bustling life of it . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.196

Hardcastle . I do stir about a great deal , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.197

that@ @'s certain . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.198

Half the differences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.199

Marlow . <paren> <font> After drinking <$$font> <$$paren> And you have
an argument in your cup , old gentleman , better than any in
Westminster-hall . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.200

Hardcastle . Ay , young gentleman , that , and a little philosophy .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.201

Marlow . <paren> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$paren> Well , this is the
first time I ever heard of an innkeeper's philosophy .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,25.202

<P_26>

Hastings . So then , like an experienced general , you attack them on
every quarter . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.204

If you find their reason manageable , you attack it with your philosophy
; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.205

if you find they have no reason , you attack them with this .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.206

Here@ @'s your health , my philosopher . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.207

<paren> <font> drinks <$$font> <$$paren> GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.208

Hardcastle . Good , very good , thank you ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.209

ha ! ha ! Your Generalship puts me in mind of Prince Eugene , when he
fought the Turks at the battle of Belgrade . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.210

You shall hear . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.211

Marlow . Instead of the battle of Belgrade , I believe it@ @'s almost
time to talk about supper . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.212

What has your philosophy got in the house for supper ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.213

Hardcastle . For supper , sir ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.214

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> Was ever such a request to a man
in his own house ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.215

Marlow . Yes , Sir , supper , Sir ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.216

I begin to feel an appetite . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.217

I shall make devilish work to-night in the larder , I promise you .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.218

Hardcastle . <paren> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$paren> Such a brazen dog
sure never my eyes beheld . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.219

<paren> <font> to him <$$font> <$$paren> Why , really , Sir , as for
supper I ca@ @n't well tell . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.220

My Dorothy and the cook maid , settle these things between them .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.221

I leave these kind of things entirely to them . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.222

Marlow . You do , do you ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.223

Hardcastle . Entirely . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.224

By-@ @the-@ @bye , I believe they are in actual consultation upon what@
@'s for supper this moment in the kitchen . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,26.225

Marlow . Then I beg they@ @'ll admit me as one of their privy <P_27>
council . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,27.226

Let the cook be called . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,27.229

No offence I hope , Sir . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,27.230

Hardcastle . O no , Sir , none in the least ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,27.231

our Bridget , the cook maid , is not very communicative upon these

Should we send for her , she might scold us all out of the house .

Your manner , Mr. Hastings , puts me in mind of my uncle , Colonel
Wallop . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,27.243

It was a saying of his , that no man was sure of his supper till he had

The devil , Sir , do you think we have brought down the whole Joiners
Company , or the Corporation of Bedford , to eat up such a supper ?

Two or three little things , clean and comfortable , will do .

Marlow . And damn your prune sauce , say I . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,28.257

Hardcastle . And yet , gentlemen , to men that are hungry , pig , with
prune sauce , is very good eating . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,28.258

Marlow . At the bottom , a calve's tongue and brains .

GOLDSMITH-1773-1,28.268

Hastings . Confound your made dishes , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,28.269

I shall be as much at a loss in this house as at a green and yellow

Send us what you please . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,29.276

So much for supper . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,29.277

. GOLDSMITH-1773-1,29.294

But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him
? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,29.295

Ha ! what do I see ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,29.296

Miss Neville , by all that@ @'s happy ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,29.297

<P_30>

Enter Miss Neville . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.299

Miss Neville . My dear Hastings ! To what unexpected good fortune , to
what accident , am I to ascribe this happy meeting ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.300

Hastings . Rather let me ask the same question , as I could never have
hoped to meet my dearest Constance at an inn . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.301

Miss Neville . An inn ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.302

sure you mistake : GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.303

my aunt , my guardian , lives here . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.304

What could induce you to think this house an inn ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.305

Hastings . My friend , Mr. Marlow , with whom I came down , and I ,
have been sent here as to an inn , I assure you .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.306

A young fellow , whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us
hither . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.307

Miss Neville . Certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousin's tricks ,
of whom you have heard me talk so often , ha ! ha ! ha ! ha !
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.308

Hastings . He whom your aunt intends for you ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.309

He of whom I have such just apprehensions ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.310

Miss Neville . You have nothing to fear from him , I assure you .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.311

You@ @'d adore him if you knew how heartily he despises me .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.312

My aunt knows it too , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.313

and has undertaken to court me for him , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.314

and actually begins to think she has made a conquest .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,30.315

<P_31>

Hastings . Thou dear dissembler ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.317

You must know , my Constance , I have just seized this happy opportunity
of my friend's visit here to get admittance into the family .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.318

The horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey ,
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.319

but they@ @'ll soon be refreshed ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.320

and then if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful Hastings , we
shall soon be landed in France , where even among slaves the laws of
marriage are respected . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.321

Miss Neville . I have often told you , that though ready to obey you ,
I yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.322

The greatest part of it was left me by my uncle , the India Director ,
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.323

and chiefly consists in jewels . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.324

I have been for some time persuading my aunt to let me wear them .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.325

I fancy I@ @'m very near succeeding . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.326

The instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to
make them and myself yours . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.327

Hastings . Perish the baubles ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.328

Your person is all I desire . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.329

In the meantime , my friend Marlow must not be let into his mistake .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.330

I know the strange reserve of his temper is such , that if abruptly
informed of it , he would instantly quit the house before our plan was
ripe for execution . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.331

Miss Neville . But how shall we keep him in the deception ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.332

Miss Hardcastle is just returned from walking ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.333

what if we still continue to deceive him ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,31.334

Marlow . The assiduities of these good people teize me beyond bearing .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,32.338

My host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone ,
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,32.339

and so he claps not only himself , but his old-fashioned wife on my back
. GOLDSMITH-1773-1,32.340

They talk of coming to sup with us too ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,32.341

and then , I suppose , we are to run the gauntlet thro' all the rest of
the family . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,32.342

GOLDSMITH-1773-1,32.344

Marlow . Can@ @not guess . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,32.347

Morally speaking , madam - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,37.466

But I see Miss Neville expecting us in the next room .

I would not intrude for the world . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,37.468

Miss Hardcastle . I protest , Sir , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,37.469

I never was more agreeably entertained in all my life .

GOLDSMITH-1773-1,38.481

I@ @'m certain he scarce looked in my face the whole time .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,38.482

Yet the fellow , but for his unaccountable bashfulness , is pretty well

He has good sense , but then so buried in his fears , that it fatigues
one more than ignorance . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,38.484

If I could teach him a little confidence , it would be doing somebody

Mrs. Hardcastle . Well ! I vow , Mr. Hastings , you are very
entertaining . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.500

There@ @'s nothing in the world I love to talk of so much as London ,
and the fashions , though I was never there myself .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.501

Hastings . Never there ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.502

You amaze me ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.503

From your air and manner , I concluded you had been bred all your life
either at Ranelagh , St. James's , or Tower Wharf .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.504

Mrs. Hardcastle . O ! Sir , you@ @'re only pleased to say so .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.505

We Country persons can have no manner at all . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.506

I@ @'m in love with the town , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.507

and that serves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics ;
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.508

but who can have a manner , that has never seen the Pantheon , the
Grotto Gardens , the Borough , and such places where the Nobility
chiefly resort ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.509

All I can do is to enjoy London at second-hand .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.510

I take care to know every tête-a-tête from the Scandalous Magazine ,
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.511

and have all the fashions , as they come out , in a letter from the two
Miss Rickets of Crooked-lane . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.512

Pray how do you like this head , Mr. Hastings ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.513

Hastings . Extremely elegant and degagée , upon my word , madam .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.514

Your Friseur is a Frenchman , I suppose ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.515

Mrs. Hardcastle . I protest , I dressed it myself from a print in the
Ladies Memorandum-book for the last year . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.516

Hastings . Indeed . Such a head in a side-box , at the Playhouse would
draw as many gazers as my Lady May'ress at a City Ball .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,39.517

<P_40>

Mrs. Hardcastle . I vow , since inoculation began , there is no such
thing to be seen as a plain woman ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.519

so one must dress a little particular , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.520

or one may escape in the crowd . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.521

Hastings . But that can never be your case , Madam , in any dress .
<paren> <font> bowing <$$font> <$$paren> GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.522

Mrs. Hardcastle . Yet , what signifies my dressing when I have such a
piece of antiquity by my side as Mr. Hardcastle :
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.523

all I can say will never argue down a single button from his cloaths .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.524

I have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig , and where he
was bald , to plaister it over , like my Lord Pately , with powder .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.525

Hastings . You are right , Madam ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.526

for , as among the ladies there are none ugly , so among the men there
are none old . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.527

Mrs. Hardcastle . But what do you think his answer was ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.528

Why , with his usual Gothic vivacity , he said I only wanted him to
throw off his wig , to convert it into a tête for my own wearing .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.529

Hastings . Intolerable ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.530

At your age you may wear what you please , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.531

and it must become you . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.532

Mrs. Hardcastle . Pray , Mr. Hastings , what do you take to be the
most fashionable age about town ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.533

Hastings . Some time ago , forty was all the mode ;
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.534

but I@ @'m told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing
winter . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,40.535

<P_41>

Mrs. Hardcastle . Seriously . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,41.537

Then I shall be too young for the fashion . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,41.538

Hastings . No lady begins now to put on jewels till she@ @'s past forty
. GOLDSMITH-1773-1,41.539

For instance , Miss there , in a polite circle , would be considered as
a child , as a mere maker of samplers . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,41.540

Mrs. Hardcastle . And yet Mrs. Niece thinks herself as much a woman ,
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,41.541

and is as fond of jewels , as the oldest of us all .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,41.542

Hastings . Your niece , is she ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,41.543

And that young gentleman , a brother of yours , I should presume ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,41.544

Mrs. Hardcastle . My son , sir . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,41.545

They are contracted to each other . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,41.546

Observe their little sports . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,41.547

propriety . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,47.668

Hardcastle . And yet , Kate , I sometimes give you some cause ,
particularly when I recommended my <font> modest <$$font> gentleman to

GOLDSMITH-1773-1,48.675

And a man of the world too ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,48.676

Hardcastle . Ay , he learned it all abroad , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,48.677

- what a fool was I , to think a young man could learn modesty by
travelling . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,48.678

He might as soon learn wit at a masquerade . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,48.679

Miss Hardcastle . It seems all natural to him .

my senses . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,48.689

Hardcastle . He met me with a loud voice , a lordly air , and a
familiarity that made my blood freeze again . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.698

Miss Hardcastle . He treated me with diffidence and respect ;
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.699

censured the manners of the age ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.700

admired the prudence of girls that never laughed ;
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.701

tired me with apologies for being tiresome ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.702

then left the room with a bow , and , madam , I would not for the world
detain you . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.703

Hardcastle . He spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.704

Asked twenty questions , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.705

Interrupted my best remarks with some silly pun ,

and when I was in my best story of the Duke of Marlborough and Prince
Eugene , he asked if I had not a good hand at making punch .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.708

Yes , Kate , he ask'd your father if he was a maker of punch !
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.709

Miss Hardcastle . One of us must certainly be mistaken .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.710

Hardcastle . If he be what he has shewn himself , I@ @'m determined he
shall never have my consent . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.711

Miss Hardcastle . And if he be the sullen thing I take him , he shall
never have mine . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,49.712

<P_50>

Hardcastle . In one thing then we are agreed - to reject him .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.714

Miss Hardcastle . Yes . But upon conditions . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.715

For if you should find him less impudent , and I more presuming ; if you
find him more respectful , and I more importunate - I do@ @n't know -
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.716

the fellow is well enough for a man - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.717

Certainly we do@ @n't meet many such at a horse race in the country .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.718

Hardcastle . If we should find him so - GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.719

But that@ @'s impossible . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.720

The first appearance has done my business . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.721

I@ @'m seldom deceived in that . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.722

Miss Hardcastle . And yet there may be many good qualities under that
first appearance . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.723

Hardcastle . Ay , when a girl finds a fellow's outside to her taste ,
she then sets about guessing the rest of his furniture .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.724

With her , a smooth face stands for good sense , and a genteel figure
for every virtue . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.725

Miss Hardcastle . I hope , Sir , a conversation begun with a compliment
to my good sense , wo@ @n't end with a sneer at my understanding ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.726

Hardcastle . Pardon me , Kate . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.727

But if young Mr. Brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions
, he may please us both , perhaps . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.728

Miss Hardcastle . And as one of us must be mistaken , what if we go to
make further discoveries ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.729

Hardcastle . Agreed . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.730

But depend on@ @'t I@ @'m in the right . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,50.731

Marlow . Never saw a more sprightly malicious eye .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.946

Yes , yes , my dear , I did call . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.947

Have you got any of your - a - what d'@ @ye call it in the house ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.948

Miss Hardcastle . No , Sir , we have been out of that these ten days .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.949

Marlow . One may call in this house , I find , to very little purpose .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.950

Suppose I should call for a taste , just by way of a trial , of the
nectar of your lips ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.951

perhaps I might be disappointed in that too . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.952

Miss Hardcastle . Nectar ! nectar ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.953

That@ @'s a liquor there@ @'s no call for in these parts .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.954

French , I suppose . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.955

We sell no French wines here , Sir . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.956

Marlow . Of true English growth , I assure you .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.957

Miss Hardcastle . Then it@ @'s odd I should not know it .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.958

We brew all sorts of wines in this house , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.959

and I have lived here these eighteen years . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.960

Marlow . Eighteen years ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.961

Why , one would think , child , you kept the bar before you were born .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.962

How old are you ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.963

Miss Hardcastle . O ! sir , I must not tell my age .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.964

They say women and music should never be dated .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.965

Marlow . To guess at this distance , you ca@ @n't be much above forty
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.966

<font> <paren> approaching . <$$paren> <$$font> Yet nearer I do@ @n't

GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.967

GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.968

but when we come very close indeed <font> <paren> attempting to kiss her
. <$$paren> <$$font> GOLDSMITH-1773-1,60.969

<P_61>

Miss Hardcastle . Pray , Sir , keep your distance .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.971

One would think you wanted to know one's age , as they do horses , by
mark of mouth . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.972

Marlow . I protest , child , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.973

you use me extremely ill . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.974

If you keep me at this distance , how is it possible you and I can ever
be acquainted ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.975

Miss Hardcastle . And who wants to be acquainted with you ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.976

I want no such acquaintance , not I . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.977

I@ @'m sure you did not treat Miss Hardcastle that was here awhile ago ,
in this obstropalous manner . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.978

I@ @'ll warrant me , before her you look'd dash'd , and kept bowing to
the ground , and talk'd , for all the world , as if you was before a
justice_of_peace . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.979

Marlow . <paren> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$paren> Egad , she has hit
it , sure enough ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.980

<paren> <font> To her . <$$paren> <$$font> In awe of her , child ? Ha

A mere awkward squinting thing ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.982

no , no . I find you do@ @n't know me . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.983

I laugh'd , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.984

and rallied her a little ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.985

but I was unwilling to be too severe . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.986

No , I could not be too severe , <font> curse me ! <$$font>
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.987

Miss Hardcastle . O ! then , Sir , you are a favourite , I find ,
among the ladies ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.988

Marlow . Yes , my dear , a great favourite . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.989

And yet hang me , I do@ @n't see what they find in me to follow .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.990

At the Ladies Club in town I@ @'m called their agreeable Rattle .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.991

Rattle , child , is not my real name , but one I@ @'m known by .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.992

My name is Solomons . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.993

Mr. Solomons , my dear , at your service . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.994

<paren> <font> Offering to salute her . <$$font> <$$paren>
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,61.995

Miss Hardcastle . Hold , sir ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.997

you are introducing me to your club , not to yourself .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.998

And you@ @'re so great a favourite there you say ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.999

Marlow . Yes , my dear . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1000

There@ @'s Mrs. Mantrap , Lady Betty Blackleg , the Countess of Sligo ,
Mrs. Langhorns , old Miss Biddy Buckskin , and your humble servant ,
keep up the spirit of the place . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1001

Miss Hardcastle . Then it@ @'s a very merry place , I suppose ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1002

Marlow . Yes , as merry as cards , supper , wine , and old women can
make us . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1003

Miss Hardcastle . And their agreeable Rattle , ha ! ha ! ha !
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1004

Marlow . <paren> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$paren> Egad ! I do@ @n't

She looks knowing , me@ @thinks . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1006

You laugh , child ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1007

Miss Hardcastle . I ca@ @n't but laugh to think what time they all have

Marlow . <paren> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$paren> All@ @'s well ;
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1009

<paren> <font> To her <$$font> <$$paren> Do you ever work , child ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1011

Miss Hardcastle . Ay , sure . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1012

There@ @'s not a screen or quilt in the whole house but what can bear
witness to that . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1013

Marlow . Odso ! then you must show me your embroidery .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1014

I embroider and draw patterns myself a little .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,62.1015

If you want a judge of your work , you must apply to me .

Such beauty fires beyond the power of resistance .

- Pshaw ! the father here ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1024

My old luck : GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1025

Hardcastle . So , madam . So , I find <font> this <$$font> is your
<font> modest <$$font> lover . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1029

This is your humble admirer , that kept his eyes fixed on the ground ,
and only ador'd at humble distance . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1030

Kate , Kate , art thou not asham'd to deceive your father so ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1031

Miss Hardcastle . Never trust me , dear papa , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1032

but he@ @'s still the modest man I first took him for ;
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1033

you@ @'ll be convinced of it as well as I . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1034

Hardcastle . By the hand of my body , I believe his impudence is
infectious ! GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1035

Did@ @n't I see him seize your hand ? GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1036

Did@ @n't I see him hawl you about like a milkmaid ?
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1037

And now you talk of his respect and his modesty , forsooth !
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1038

Miss Hardcastle . But if I shortly convince you of his modesty , that
he has only the faults that will pass off with time , and the virtues
that will improve with age , I hope you@ @'ll forgive him .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1039

Hardcastle . The girl would actually make one run mad !
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1040

I tell you , I@ @'ll not be convinced . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1041

I am convinced . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1042

He has scarce been three hours in the house , GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1043

and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1044

You may like his impudence , and call it modesty .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,63.1045

<P_64>

but my son-in-law , madam , must have very different qualifications .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,64.1047

Miss Hardcastle . Sir , I ask but this night to convince you .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,64.1048

Hardcastle . You shall not have half the time ,
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,64.1049

for I have thoughts of turning him out this very hour .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,64.1050

Miss Hardcastle . Give me that hour then , and I hope to satisfy you .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,64.1051

Hardcastle . Well , an hour let it be then . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,64.1052

But I@ @'ll have no trifling with your father .
GOLDSMITH-1773-1,64.1053

All fair and open do you mind me . GOLDSMITH-1773-1,64.1054

Miss Hardcastle . I hope , Sir , you have ever found that I considered
your commands as my pride ; GOLDSMITH-1773-1,64.1055

for your kindness is such , that my duty as yet has been inclination .
