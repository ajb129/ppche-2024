The Honeymoon BENNETT-1911-2,7.4

Act I . BENNETT-1911-2,7.5

<$$heading>

<font> A sitting-room in the only hotel at a small seaside resort in
Essex . BENNETT-1911-2,7.7

Old-fashioned Victorian furniture , producing a picturesque general
effect . BENNETT-1911-2,7.8

Some modern touch , such as a framed coloured advertisement of pneumatic
tyres . <$$font> BENNETT-1911-2,7.9

<font> Door , <$$font> R. , <font> leading to hall , principal entrance
, and kitchen . BENNETT-1911-2,7.10

Door , <$$font> L. , <font> leading through a porch to the garden .
BENNETT-1911-2,7.11

A large window , divided into three portions by stonework , at the back
: BENNETT-1911-2,7.12

the panes are small ; BENNETT-1911-2,7.13

one of these portions is open , BENNETT-1911-2,7.14

the others are closed . <$$font> BENNETT-1911-2,7.15

<font> Through the window can be seen a view of the garden , and the sea
in the distance . BENNETT-1911-2,7.16

The fireplace is not seen . <$$font> BENNETT-1911-2,7.17

Cedric <font> and <$$font> Flora <font> are seated at either side of a
tea-table . <$$font> BENNETT-1911-2,7.18

Time : <font> Afternoon in June . BENNETT-1911-2,7.19

Sunshine . <$$font> BENNETT-1911-2,7.20

Flora . Another cup ? BENNETT-1911-2,7.21

<paren> Cedric , <font> looking at her , makes no reply . <$$font>
<$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,7.22

Cedric ! Another Cup ? BENNETT-1911-2,7.23

<P_8>

<paren> <font> with a touch of very good-humoured impatience <$$font>
<$$paren> . <paren> Cedric <font> rises , BENNETT-1911-2,8.25

goes round the table to her , BENNETT-1911-2,8.26

takes hold of her , BENNETT-1911-2,8.27

and kisses her . <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,8.28

Cedric . <paren> <font> Standing over her , she looking up at him .
<$$font> <$$paren> I@ @'ve been wanting to do that for about thirty
solid minutes . BENNETT-1911-2,8.29

Flora . Then why did@ @n't you , my poor boy ? BENNETT-1911-2,8.30

<paren> <font> Cedric gives a gesture to show that he does@ @n't know
why <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,8.31

... Instead of keeping us both waiting like that ! BENNETT-1911-2,8.32

<paren> <font> Reflective . <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,8.33

And yet it@ @'s barely three hours since you kissed me in the vestry !
BENNETT-1911-2,8.34

Cedric . Vestry be dashed ! ' BENNETT-1911-2,8.35

And here@ @'s another thing I@ @'ve been wanting to do
BENNETT-1911-2,8.36

<paren> <font> he carefully kisses her ear <$$font> <$$paren> .
BENNETT-1911-2,8.37

Flora . My ear ! BENNETT-1911-2,8.38

Cedric . Precisely , your ear ! Strange ! BENNETT-1911-2,8.39

... And I can tell you something even stranger . BENNETT-1911-2,8.40

Shall I ? BENNETT-1911-2,8.41

<paren> <font> She nods . <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,8.42

When I@ @'m standing over you I feel as if I should like to kill you !
BENNETT-1911-2,8.43

Yes , really , Fluff ! It takes me all of a sudden !
BENNETT-1911-2,8.44

You know - when you lean out of a high balcony and you feel you must
jump - well , it@ @'s that sort of a feeling . BENNETT-1911-2,8.45

Flora . What particular <font> kind <$$font> of homicide ?
BENNETT-1911-2,8.46

Cedric . Oh ! <paren> <font> at a loss <$$font> <$$paren> a kind of a
fierce crushing . BENNETT-1911-2,8.47

<paren> <font> She smiles . <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,8.48

You think it@ @'s justifiable ? BENNETT-1911-2,8.49

<P_9>

Flora . I do@ @n't mind so long as I know my risks :
BENNETT-1911-2,9.51

Cedric . <paren> <font> After staring at her , with a convinced air .
<$$font> <$$paren> We shall get on together all right !
BENNETT-1911-2,9.52

Flora . Yes , I think we@ @'re doing rather well so far , considering
<paren> <font> turning the ring on his finger <$$font> <$$paren> .
BENNETT-1911-2,9.53

Cedric . Considering what ? BENNETT-1911-2,9.54

Flora . Considering how nervous we both are , naturally
BENNETT-1911-2,9.55

<paren> <font> drops his hand <$$font> <$$paren> . BENNETT-1911-2,9.56

Cedric . <paren> <font> Moving away . Half to himself . <$$font>
<$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,9.57

Yes , and we shall keep getting more nervous ! BENNETT-1911-2,9.58

Flora . <paren> <font> Resuming exactly the same matter-of-fact tone as
when she first put the question . <$$font> <$$paren> Another cup ?
BENNETT-1911-2,9.59

Cedric . <paren> <font> Similar tone . <$$font> <$$paren> How many
have I had ? BENNETT-1911-2,9.60

Flora . I do@ @n't know , dear . BENNETT-1911-2,9.61

Cedric . I@ @'ve had enough , then . BENNETT-1911-2,9.62

Flora . Well , about our programme . Suppose we settle it a bit .
BENNETT-1911-2,9.63

Cedric . Yes , let@ @'s . BENNETT-1911-2,9.64

<paren> <font> Sits down . <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,9.65

Flora . I do think it was a lovely idea to start off without any
programme at all ! BENNETT-1911-2,9.66

Heaven itself could@ @n't say where we sha@ @n't be this time next week
! BENNETT-1911-2,9.67

Cedric . Well , subject to your approval , I do@ @n't mind informing
heaven that anyhow we sha@ @n't be here . BENNETT-1911-2,9.68

Flora . Tired of this Place - already ? BENNETT-1911-2,9.69

Cedric . On the contrary ! BENNETT-1911-2,9.70

But it@ @'s too small <P_10> to hold a couple that have just walked out
of a vestry . BENNETT-1911-2,10.71

One hotel , one flagstaff , one boat , one sea . BENNETT-1911-2,10.72

No pier , no tea-shop , no concert , and very probably no moon .
BENNETT-1911-2,10.73

Flora . Extrardinary how even three hours of married life will change a
man ! BENNETT-1911-2,10.74

You always used to be rather keen on quietness . Solitude , old flannel
suits , and so on . BENNETT-1911-2,10.75

Cedric . Now look here , Fluff ! BENNETT-1911-2,10.76

This honeymoon programme is important . BENNETT-1911-2,10.77

Er - <paren> <font> hesitates <$$font> <$$paren> . BENNETT-1911-2,10.78

Flora . <paren> <font> Nods . <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,10.79

Let@ @'s talk as man to man . BENNETT-1911-2,10.80

Cedric . The fact is I@ @'ve always had a very Distinct theory about
honeymoons . BENNETT-1911-2,10.81

Far from The madding crowd is a mistake on a honeymoon ...
BENNETT-1911-2,10.82

Solitude ! BENNETT-1911-2,10.83

Wherever you are , if you@ @'re on a honeymoon , you@ @'ll get quite as
Much solitude as is good for you every Twenty-four hours .
BENNETT-1911-2,10.84

Constant change and distraction - that@ @'s What wants arranging for .
BENNETT-1911-2,10.85

Solitude will arrange itself . BENNETT-1911-2,10.86

Flora . I did@ @n't expect this from you , dear . BENNETT-1911-2,10.87

Cedric . <font> Hastily , apologetic . <$$font> <$$paren> Simply a
theory ! BENNETT-1911-2,10.88

I@ @'ve had no practical experience , BENNETT-1911-2,10.89

and I@ @'m Perfectly ready to sit at your feet in the Matter .
BENNETT-1911-2,10.90

Honestly , I do@ @n't care a straw . BENNETT-1911-2,10.91

I May be wrong , BENNETT-1911-2,10.92

and if you - BENNETT-1911-2,10.93

Flora . <paren> <font> Solemnly . <$$font> <$$paren> You are@ @n't
wrong ! BENNETT-1911-2,10.94

You@ @'re quite fearfully right ! BENNETT-1911-2,10.95

Cedric . <font> After starting at her with a convinced <P_11> air .
<$$font> <$$paren> We <font> shall <$$font> get on together -
BENNETT-1911-2,11.96

that@ @'s a bedrock certainly ! BENNETT-1911-2,11.97

Now this place ought to be excellent for a beginning ,
BENNETT-1911-2,11.98

but I should imagine that about a couple of days of it would do us .
BENNETT-1911-2,11.99

Flora . I never suspected - no , really I never <font> did <$$font>
suspect - that any man could have as much common-sense , beforehand
{COM:font_change_around_"before"} , as you have , Cedric , Not to speak
of courage ! BENNETT-1911-2,11.100

Cedric . Cheek , you mean . BENNETT-1911-2,11.101

But then of Course , I <font> am <$$font> supposed to have a bit of
nerve , BENNETT-1911-2,11.102

Well , that@ @'s settled . BENNETT-1911-2,11.103

We are to travel , then . BENNETT-1911-2,11.104

Flora . The point is , where ? BENNETT-1911-2,11.105

Cedric . Where would you like ? BENNETT-1911-2,11.106

Flora . <paren> <font> Radiantly . <$$font> <$$paren> Anywhere
{COM:font_change_around_"Any"} . BENNETT-1911-2,11.107

Cedric . What about Paris ? BENNETT-1911-2,11.108

Flora . Oh , not Paris . BENNETT-1911-2,11.109

Cedric . Why not ? BENNETT-1911-2,11.110

Flora . We should be simply mobbed . BENNETT-1911-2,11.111

My dearest boy , have you ever heard speak of the simplicity of genius ?
BENNETT-1911-2,11.112

Cedric . I seem to have read about it somewhere , perhaps in the
ladies' papers . BENNETT-1911-2,11.113

Flora . Well , you wo@ @n't understand it , because you@ @'ve got it -
acutely . BENNETT-1911-2,11.114

Cedric . And here all these years I@ @'ve been taking myself for rather
a crafty person ! BENNETT-1911-2,11.115

Flora . Do you know how many times I@ @'ve counted your portrait in the
weeklies this year ? BENNETT-1911-2,11.116

One_hundred_and_forty-six ! BENNETT-1911-2,11.117

And <P_12> that@ @'s not reckoning the pictures where your aeroplane@
@'s so high up that you only look like a fly in a mouse-trap .
BENNETT-1911-2,12.118

Cedric . In my simple mind I@ @'d always thought that the surest way
never to be recognised in the street was to have your portrait in the
papers . BENNETT-1911-2,12.119

Flora . And then there@ @'s your likeness to your mother !
BENNETT-1911-2,12.120

A_hundred_and_fifty-one_thousand copies of your dear mother's last novel
sold up to yesterday - BENNETT-1911-2,12.121

so I saw in the " Telegraph . BENNETT-1911-2,12.122

" And then her new novel out today ! BENNETT-1911-2,12.123

Cedric . I@ @'m not suggesting that we should camp out in Piccadilly
for our honeymoon , my dove and my love ; BENNETT-1911-2,12.124

I said Paris . BENNETT-1911-2,12.125

Flora . All London will be in Paris . BENNETT-1911-2,12.126

Cedric . What - next week ? BENNETT-1911-2,12.127

Flora . Every week . BENNETT-1911-2,12.128

Excuse me asking a pointed question , dearest , BENNETT-1911-2,12.129

but have you ever been to Paris - I mean , since the flood ?
BENNETT-1911-2,12.130

Cedric . Yes . My knowledge of the unwieldy goods department of the
big railway stations is probably matchless . BENNETT-1911-2,12.131

Flora . Well , if you@ @'d stepped outside the stations you@ @'d know
that Paris is now exclusively inhabited by nice respectable people from
London and nice respectable people from Arizona ; BENNETT-1911-2,12.132

and when they are@ @n't cricking their necks to look at aeroplanes ,
they@ @'re <P_13> improving their minds with your dear mother's latest
novel . BENNETT-1911-2,13.133

Cedric . <paren> <font> Mock serious . <$$font> <$$paren> Will you
believe me - BENNETT-1911-2,13.134

I@ @'d no notion of this at all ! BENNETT-1911-2,13.135

Flora . I tell you what - BENNETT-1911-2,13.136

I would@ @n't mind going to Paris under an assumed name .
BENNETT-1911-2,13.137

Cedric . Oh , no ! BENNETT-1911-2,13.138

Flora . Why not ? BENNETT-1911-2,13.139

It would be amusing . BENNETT-1911-2,13.140

Cedric . I do@ @n't see myself travelling under a false name .
BENNETT-1911-2,13.141

I suppose I am too English . BENNETT-1911-2,13.142

Flora . Well , I do@ @n't see myself in a Paris hotel as the bride of
the most celebrated English aviator , and the daughter-in-law of the
most celebrated English lady-novelist . BENNETT-1911-2,13.143

I do not ! BENNETT-1911-2,13.144

<paren> <font> With a characteristic gesture . <$$font> <$$paren>
Mobbed is@ @n't the word for what we should be . BENNETT-1911-2,13.145

Cedric . <paren> <font> Gazing at her . <$$font> <$$paren> You must
have noticed that I@ @'m not what you@ @'d call gushing ;
BENNETT-1911-2,13.146

I@ @'ve known myself go for a month without using a single superlative ;
BENNETT-1911-2,13.147

but really , my most dear girl , my Fluffiest , when you strike an
attitude like that , you@ @'re more marvellously and ineffably adorable
than ever . BENNETT-1911-2,13.148

Your beauty , your charm , your enormous slap-upness -
BENNETT-1911-2,13.149

<paren> <font> changing his tone <$$font> <$$paren> - Well , ecstasy is
not my line ... BENNETT-1911-2,13.150

I only said Paris because the mater asked me if I thought we should be
going there , and I told her it was possible . BENNETT-1911-2,13.151

Flora . Will <font> she <$$font> be there ? BENNETT-1911-2,13.152

<P_14>

Cedric . No , no ! Only , if we <font> should <$$font> happen to go
there , she wanted me to count the panes of glass in a lamp-post on the
Alexander III. bridge . BENNETT-1911-2,14.154

One of her realistic details , you know . BENNETT-1911-2,14.155

I expect she@ @'s got her hero staring absently up at that lamp-post -
after an indiscreet evening ... BENNETT-1911-2,14.156

She may be depending on me . BENNETT-1911-2,14.157

Flora . But surely that is@ @n't a reason why we should go to Paris !
BENNETT-1911-2,14.158

Your dear mother might have wanted to know the number of ribs in the
umbrella of the King of Siam - BENNETT-1911-2,14.159

should we have had to book to Bangkok ? BENNETT-1911-2,14.160

Cedric . I was only - BENNETT-1911-2,14.161

Flora . Husband , I must tell you something about your mother .
BENNETT-1911-2,14.162

I@ @'ve kept it a secret from you . BENNETT-1911-2,14.163

Do you know what made her give up her terrific scheme of our being
married in the cathedral by the Bishop , surrounded by the press of
Europe ? BENNETT-1911-2,14.164

Cedric . I thought our angel-tongues persuaded her out of it .
BENNETT-1911-2,14.165

Flora . Not at all . BENNETT-1911-2,14.166

A threat did it . BENNETT-1911-2,14.167

I dropped in on her one day for a little private chat while you were at
Blackpool . BENNETT-1911-2,14.168

She was just going to arrange with the Bishop . BENNETT-1911-2,14.169

I told her confidentially - but of course <font> nicely <$$font> - that
if she would@ @n't agree to us being married by a curate at Colchester ,
with nobody but her and your father and Charlie present , and nothing
whatever in the papers for at least a fortnight , <P_15> then I should
insist on being married at a registry office . BENNETT-1911-2,15.170

Cedric . The deuce you did ! BENNETT-1911-2,15.171

What did she say ? BENNETT-1911-2,15.172

Flora . She merely said : " Of course your wish is our law , Mrs.
Lloyd . " BENNETT-1911-2,15.173

But the next day she was calling me " Flora " again .
BENNETT-1911-2,15.174

Cedric . The mater folded up like that ? BENNETT-1911-2,15.175

Flora . There ! <paren> <font> Laughing . <$$font> <$$paren> Listen
to your own tone , dearest . BENNETT-1911-2,15.176

Naturally she folded up . BENNETT-1911-2,15.177

She only needs proper treatment . BENNETT-1911-2,15.178

Cedric . Well , I had a bit of a stir with her when I decided to give
up my amateur status ; BENNETT-1911-2,15.179

but I must say as a rule I get on very well with the mater .
BENNETT-1911-2,15.180

Flora . So do I . BENNETT-1911-2,15.181

It@ @'s because I get on so well with her that we had a curate to-day
instead of the Bishop . BENNETT-1911-2,15.182

Rather a jolly curate , did@ @n't you think ? BENNETT-1911-2,15.183

Cedric . Struck me as a queer lot . BENNETT-1911-2,15.184

Flora . Of course they@ @'re all queer . BENNETT-1911-2,15.185

I liked him because when he asked me to sign my name he did@ @n't say
<paren> <font> imitating the snigger of a curate <$$font> <$$paren> "
for the last time , " BENNETT-1911-2,15.186

They always do , you know . BENNETT-1911-2,15.187

It@ @'s almost part of the service , for them . BENNETT-1911-2,15.188

And if he had said it , I do believe I should have screamed .
BENNETT-1911-2,15.189

Cedric . I say , Fluff , why after hiding this secret for several weeks
- it@ @'s practically a double life that you@ @'ve been leading -
BENNETT-1911-2,15.190

why <P_16> do you reveal it just at this particular moment ?
BENNETT-1911-2,16.191

Flora . Oh - sheer caprice , my dearest ! BENNETT-1911-2,16.192

It just popped into my head . BENNETT-1911-2,16.193

Cedric . <paren> <font> Somewhat troubled and awkward . <$$font>
<$$paren> So your notion is that the mater's moral empire over her
family and the British public might be checked without grave loss of
life , eh ? BENNETT-1911-2,16.194

Flora . Cedric ! BENNETT-1911-2,16.195

<paren> Cedric <font> looks at her , arrested and questioning .
<$$font> <$$paren> What@ @'s the rarest thing in the world ? Quick ?
BENNETT-1911-2,16.196

Cedric . Common-sense , of course . BENNETT-1911-2,16.197

Flora . Oh ! Good ! BENNETT-1911-2,16.198

I was afraid you might say a well-cooked potato . BENNETT-1911-2,16.199

Cedric . You ought to know me better than that . BENNETT-1911-2,16.200

Flora . But , Cedric , it@ @'s only now that we@ @'re beginning to make
each other's acquaintance . BENNETT-1911-2,16.201

Cedric . That@ @'s true ! BENNETT-1911-2,16.202

But how did <font> you <$$font> know that common-sense is the rarest
thing in the world ? BENNETT-1911-2,16.203

Flora . Because I@ @'ve got so very little of it myself .
BENNETT-1911-2,16.204

But even a very little will go a long way . BENNETT-1911-2,16.205

Now , have I told you that our marriage is@ @n't going to be like
ordinary marriages - BENNETT-1911-2,16.206

I mean , really ? BENNETT-1911-2,16.207

Cedric . Well , you have@ @n't exactly told me , BENNETT-1911-2,16.208

but you@ @'ve allowed me to suspect the fact . BENNETT-1911-2,16.209

Flora . Most marriages , and especially most <P_17> honeymoons , are
third-rate simply because the people concerned in them do@ @n't bring
their bit of common-sense to bear on the problems that are <paren>
<font> mock platform manner <$$font> <$$paren> - er - continually
arising . BENNETT-1911-2,17.210

<paren> <font> Laughing . <$$font> <$$paren> I intend to keep my bit of
common-sense healthy by constant exercise . BENNETT-1911-2,17.211

Common-sense , steadily applied , will solve any problem .
BENNETT-1911-2,17.212

Cedric . <paren> <font> Emphatically . <$$font> <$$paren> Any !
BENNETT-1911-2,17.213

<paren> <font> After a pause . <$$font> <$$paren> Always provided -
BENNETT-1911-2,17.214

Flora . <paren> <font> Surprised . <$$font> <$$paren> Always provided
? BENNETT-1911-2,17.215

Cedric . My dear , in this outpouring of wisdom I , too , must have my
share . BENNETT-1911-2,17.216

Common-sense will solve any problem - any ! - always provided it is
employed simultaneously with politeness . BENNETT-1911-2,17.217

During a long and varied career as a bachelor , dear spouse <paren>
<font> mock platform manner <$$font> <$$paren> , I have noticed that
marriage is usually the death of politeness between a man and a woman .
BENNETT-1911-2,17.218

I have noticed that the stronger the passion the weaker the manners .
BENNETT-1911-2,17.219

Now , my theory is that politeness , instead of decreasing with intimacy
- should increase ! BENNETT-1911-2,17.220

And when I say " politeness " I mean common , superficial politeness .
BENNETT-1911-2,17.221

I do@ @n't mean the deep-down sort of thing that you can only detect
with a divining-rod . BENNETT-1911-2,17.222

... Pardon , you were saying ? BENNETT-1911-2,17.223

Flora . Cedric ! <paren> <font> Impulsively rushes to him and kisses
him . <$$font> <$$paren> How <font> right <$$font> you are !
BENNETT-1911-2,17.224

It@ @'s <P_18> exactly what I@ @'ve been thinking for years .
BENNETT-1911-2,18.225

Now , as to common-sense and the programme . It would be against
common-sense for us to begin by annoying your mother .
BENNETT-1911-2,18.226

If you really do think your mother would be in the least upset by our
not going to Paris , naturally I shall be delighted to go .
BENNETT-1911-2,18.227

We could stop just long enough to inspect the lamp-post - and then off
again . BENNETT-1911-2,18.228

Cedric . Oh , no ! Oh , no ! BENNETT-1911-2,18.229

Of course she wo@ @n't be upset ! BENNETT-1911-2,18.230

Cedric . A symbol . BENNETT-1911-2,18.236

Flora . A symbol . BENNETT-1911-2,18.237

And it ought to be done - well , adequately . BENNETT-1911-2,18.238

Cedric . Nineteen_thousand pounds odd of mine is now on deposit at my

Herr Klopstock , who has already , we understand , taken the whole of a

that his machine will rise easily to at least four_thousand feet .
BENNETT-1911-2,26.422

The Kaiser has just christened the aeroplane the Black Eagle , by

BENNETT-1911-2,26.433

It@ @s altogether too tempting . BENNETT-1911-2,26.434

Besides , it seems to me anybody ought to be able to fly over a little

BENNETT-1911-2,27.438

And then the Aero Club has been clever enough to ordain that the aviator
is to start and land within four miles of the summit .
BENNETT-1911-2,27.439

How is a man to get off on such ground , BENNETT-1911-2,27.440

we@ @'ll sleep at the Grand Babylon , or in the backyard .
BENNETT-1911-2,28.477

<paren> <font> A little pause . <$$font> <$$paren>
BENNETT-1911-2,28.478

Of course as a nuisance it completely baffles description ... To-day of
all days ... BENNETT-1911-2,28.479

However , Fluff , as I said before with profound truth - here you are !
BENNETT-1911-2,28.480

It would never do in this world to give the German lot even a chance .
BENNETT-1911-2,28.481

The thing@ @'s too spectacular - altogether too <P_29> spectacular .
BENNETT-1911-2,29.482

If it was a question of beating us quietly and for ever in technics or
manufacture , the B.P. would@ @n't think twice about it ;
BENNETT-1911-2,29.483

but Snowdon is Snowdon , BENNETT-1911-2,29.484

and a black eagle is a black eagle , BENNETT-1911-2,29.485

and <paren> <font> comically <$$font> <$$paren> in short , madam ,
England will turn to your husband in its hour of peril .
BENNETT-1911-2,29.486

In other words , Fluff , it@ @'s up to me . BENNETT-1911-2,29.487

Flora . <paren> <font> Lightly <$$font> <$$paren> I say , Cedric .
BENNETT-1911-2,29.488

Cedric . Well ? BENNETT-1911-2,29.489

Flora . I thought we were agreed about a full calendar month .
BENNETT-1911-2,29.490

Cedric . <paren> <font> After a pause ; as lightly as possible .
<$$font> <$$paren> Do you mean you think I ought to let Snowdon slide ?
BENNETT-1911-2,29.491

Do you really - BENNETT-1911-2,29.492

Flora . Yes , of course . BENNETT-1911-2,29.493

Do@ @n't you ? BENNETT-1911-2,29.494

Cedric . You are@ @n't serious ? BENNETT-1911-2,29.495

Flora . <paren> <font> Persuasively . <$$font> <$$paren> My dearest
boy , is there any reason why I should@ @n't differ from you and yet be
serious ? BENNETT-1911-2,29.496

Cedric . No , of course not . BENNETT-1911-2,29.497

But in a case like this - if there was anybody else to take my place , I
would@ @n't mind . BENNETT-1911-2,29.498

Of course Smith-James could do it if only he would use our machine -
BENNETT-1911-2,29.499

but he wo@ @n't . BENNETT-1911-2,29.500

Nothing would induce him to . BENNETT-1911-2,29.501

So as I keep on saying - there you are ! BENNETT-1911-2,29.502

Flora . But what does it matter ? BENNETT-1911-2,29.503

Is it because the other man's machine has been called the Black Eagle in
a telegram that you - BENNETT-1911-2,29.504

<P_30>

Cedric . Yes , partly . BENNETT-1911-2,30.506

Flora . Oh ! So that If this canvas-backed duck flies first over a
lump of mud called Snowdon - BENNETT-1911-2,30.507

Cedric . But do@ @n't I tell you Snowdon is the highest mountain in
England ? BENNETT-1911-2,30.508

Flora . No , it is@ @n't . BENNETT-1911-2,30.509

Cedric . Pardon me . BENNETT-1911-2,30.510

Three_thousand_five_hundred_and_seventy feet . BENNETT-1911-2,30.511

The next highest is - BENNETT-1911-2,30.512

Flora . Well , you go BENNETT-1911-2,30.513

and tell Lloyd George that Snowdon is the highest mountain in England ,
BENNETT-1911-2,30.514

and see what you@ @'ll get . BENNETT-1911-2,30.515

Cedric . Wales , then . BENNETT-1911-2,30.516

It@ @'s all the same . BENNETT-1911-2,30.517

Flora . <paren> <font> With great charm . <$$font> <$$paren> If you@
@'re thinking of the ten_thousand pounds , I do@ @n't mind informing you
, as a great secret , that I would@ @n't sell a single day of my
honeymoon with you for ten times ten_thousand pounds .
BENNETT-1911-2,30.518

But I told you I wanted an expensive honeymoon , did@ @n't I ?
BENNETT-1911-2,30.519

Cedric . <paren> <font> Shaking his head and with calm certainty .
<$$font> <$$paren> The money does@ @n't influence me that much !
BENNETT-1911-2,30.520

<paren> <font> Snaps his fingers . <$$font> <$$paren>
BENNETT-1911-2,30.521

I do@ @n't wish to flatter myself , BENNETT-1911-2,30.522

but I think I could light your cigarette with a bank note as gracefully
as anybody . BENNETT-1911-2,30.523

No - BENNETT-1911-2,30.524

Flora . You@ @'re pulling away at that cigar of yours ,
BENNETT-1911-2,30.525

but I suppose you know it is@ @n't lighted . BENNETT-1911-2,30.526

Cedric . Is@ @n't it ? BENNETT-1911-2,30.527

<paren> <font> As he lights the cigar . <$$font> <$$paren> No ! This
Snowdon business . BENNETT-1911-2,30.528

Well , it@ @'s a <P_31> symbol <paren> <font> half to himself <$$font>
<$$paren> . BENNETT-1911-2,31.529

I wonder how I can make you understand that . BENNETT-1911-2,31.530

Flora . <paren> <font> Fascinatingly . <$$font> <$$paren> Oh ! Force
is unnecessary , BENNETT-1911-2,31.531

I understand that . BENNETT-1911-2,31.532

But who was it said just now that the honeymoon was a symbol ?
BENNETT-1911-2,31.533

It stands for all our married life . BENNETT-1911-2,31.534

It@ @'s the most exciting and interesting time we shall ever have .
BENNETT-1911-2,31.535

And you ca@ @n't put a honeymoon off , you know . BENNETT-1911-2,31.536

It is@ @n't like a box of cigars that you can keep in a cupboard and
enjoy one of them every now and then when you@ @'ve got a few minutes to
spare . BENNETT-1911-2,31.537

It must happen now or never . BENNETT-1911-2,31.538

You ca@ @n't postpone it . BENNETT-1911-2,31.539

You can only kill it . BENNETT-1911-2,31.540

<paren> <font> Smiles lightly . <$$font> <$$paren>
BENNETT-1911-2,31.541

Cedric . <paren> <font> Taking hold of her , in a caressing tone .
<$$font> <$$paren> She@ @'s tragic ! BENNETT-1911-2,31.542

Flora . <paren> <font> Disengaging herself ' . <$$font> <$$paren> Oh ,
no ! BENNETT-1911-2,31.543

Cedric . Now just listen to me , Fluff . BENNETT-1911-2,31.544

I@ @'m really thinking at least as much of you as of myself .
BENNETT-1911-2,31.545

This affair is bound to have an influence on my career .
BENNETT-1911-2,31.546

Flora . And what about its influence on mine ? BENNETT-1911-2,31.547

Cedric . Same thing . BENNETT-1911-2,31.548

I suppose our interests are identical . BENNETT-1911-2,31.549

Flora . My poor simple boy , do you really believe that ?
BENNETT-1911-2,31.550

Cedric . Well , dash it , BENNETT-1911-2,31.551

are@ @n't you my wife ? BENNETT-1911-2,31.552

Flora . So far as I@ @'m concerned , it would be more correct to say
that you@ @'re my husband . BENNETT-1911-2,31.553

In fact , you@ @'ve got a career as my husband . BENNETT-1911-2,31.554

<P_32>

Cedric . <paren> <font> Anxious to be fair . <$$font> <$$paren>
Certainly . And you as my wife . BENNETT-1911-2,32.556

But - BENNETT-1911-2,32.557

Flora . One second , dearest . BENNETT-1911-2,32.558

You@ @'re unique as an aviator , are@ @n't you ? BENNETT-1911-2,32.559

Cedric . <paren> <font> Conventionally modest . <$$font> <$$paren> Oh
- well - BENNETT-1911-2,32.560

Flora . Now . Man to man . Give your modesty a rest .
BENNETT-1911-2,32.561

Really , do@ @n't you consider you@ @'ve proved yourself unique in your
line ? BENNETT-1911-2,32.562

Cedric . <paren> <font> Hesitatingly , chivalrously . <$$font>
<$$paren> I suppose I@ @'m just about as unique in my line as you are in
yours , my dear . BENNETT-1911-2,32.563

Flora . Now that@ @'s very nice of you . BENNETT-1911-2,32.564

Cedric . Not at all . BENNETT-1911-2,32.565

Flora . Yes , it is , because it@ @'s exactly what I wanted you to say
. BENNETT-1911-2,32.566

You@ @'ve often said that I@ @'m unique , BENNETT-1911-2,32.567

and I just wanted you to say it again at this identical particular
instant . BENNETT-1911-2,32.568

Of course I could have reminded you of it , BENNETT-1911-2,32.569

but that would@ @n't have been quite so effective .
BENNETT-1911-2,32.570

That@ @'s why it@ @'s very nice of you . BENNETT-1911-2,32.571

Cedric . So you are unique - BENNETT-1911-2,32.572

I@ @'ll say it as often as you like . BENNETT-1911-2,32.573

Flora . I warn you , BENNETT-1911-2,32.574

you@ @'re giving yourself away . BENNETT-1911-2,32.575

Cedric . Delighted ! BENNETT-1911-2,32.576

Flora . I would@ @n't care to repeat all the lovely adjectives you@
@'ve used about me . BENNETT-1911-2,32.577

If you were@ @n't such a determined enemy of gush and superlatives -
people might suspect that sometimes you exaggerated the tiniest bit when
<P_33> you talked about me , <font> to <$$font> me .
BENNETT-1911-2,33.578

But of course <font> I <$$font> know you never do exaggerate , at any
rate consciously , BENNETT-1911-2,33.579

and <font> you <$$font> know you@ @'re a very good judge .
BENNETT-1911-2,33.580

Cedric . What of ? BENNETT-1911-2,33.581

Flora . Us ! BENNETT-1911-2,33.582

... Now look here , Cedric , BENNETT-1911-2,33.583

do@ @n't you think it would be a pity to stop this creature , who is so
unique in her line , from giving a full exhibition of her unique powers
at a unique moment ; at the very height of her career .
BENNETT-1911-2,33.584

You know , she@ @'ll never have another opportunity like this of proving
that she really is unique in her line . BENNETT-1911-2,33.585

Cedric . What do you call her line ? BENNETT-1911-2,33.586

Let@ @'s be clear . BENNETT-1911-2,33.587

Flora . <paren> <font> Quietly , off-handedly , after a pause .
<$$font> <$$paren> To charm . Merely that . BENNETT-1911-2,33.588

Cedric . By God ! She can do that . BENNETT-1911-2,33.589

But <paren> <font> winningly , but half to himself <$$font> <$$paren> ,
I hardly know how to put it . BENNETT-1911-2,33.590

Flora . I think you do , dearest ; BENNETT-1911-2,33.591

but you@ @'re so nice , you do@ @n't like to . BENNETT-1911-2,33.592

You wanted to make a comparison between the importance of your line and
the importance of mine . BENNETT-1911-2,33.593

I admit all that . BENNETT-1911-2,33.594

I@ @'m quite humble . BENNETT-1911-2,33.595

I fully admit that if Hyde Park were full of aviators and Battersea Park
were full of charming young women , rather pretty and - er - chic -
<paren> <font> gesture to show off her frock <$$font> <$$paren> - I
fully admit that not a man among you would ever <font> dream - <$$font>
of <P_34> crossing the river . BENNETT-1911-2,34.596

I fully admit that if every aviator in Europe gave up business to-morrow
the entire world would go into mourning , whereas if all the charming
women retired from business they@ @'d never be missed .
BENNETT-1911-2,34.597

Still - BENNETT-1911-2,34.598

Cedric . <paren> <font> Appreciative . <$$font> <$$paren> You@ @'re a
witty girl - BENNETT-1911-2,34.599

Flora . We@ @'re both rather witty , are@ @n't we , at times ?
BENNETT-1911-2,34.600

Cedric . But the fact is I was@ @n't going to make any comparison at
all between our respective lines . BENNETT-1911-2,34.601

I was only going to point out that you can keep on being charming all
the time . BENNETT-1911-2,34.602

You@ @'re always charming ; BENNETT-1911-2,34.603

you@ @'re always doing <font> your <$$font> line .
BENNETT-1911-2,34.604

Whereas for my line . I have to choose times and seasons - or rather I
do@ @n't choose 'em , they@ @'re chosen for me , as , for instance ,
just now . BENNETT-1911-2,34.605

Wherever we are , honeymoon or no honeymoon , you@ @'re - well , you@
@'re giving an exhibition flight . BENNETT-1911-2,34.606

Flora . Now , Cedric , your good nature@ @'s getting the better of your
sincerity . BENNETT-1911-2,34.607

I@ @'m not always charming . BENNETT-1911-2,34.608

Ask your dear mother . BENNETT-1911-2,34.609

And have you forgotten our historic shindy about the length of your
moustache scarcely three months ago ? BENNETT-1911-2,34.610

I@ @'m <font> not <$$font> always charming . BENNETT-1911-2,34.611

And I do@ @n't <font> want <$$font> to be always charming .
BENNETT-1911-2,34.612

Who would ? BENNETT-1911-2,34.613

As for exhibition flights , you@ @'ve never seen me give one .
BENNETT-1911-2,34.614

You think you have , BENNETT-1911-2,34.615

but what you@ @'ve seen up to now is nothing . BENNETT-1911-2,34.616

I do@ @n't mind telling you that I had <P_35> arranged a rather
sensational exhibition flight for the next month .
BENNETT-1911-2,35.617

It would last just thirty-one days . BENNETT-1911-2,35.618

I do@ @n't mind telling you that I@ @'ve thought a good deal about it ,
and made all my elaborate preparations . BENNETT-1911-2,35.619

It really would be a pity to interfere with it . BENNETT-1911-2,35.620

And you know it ca@ @n't be postponed . BENNETT-1911-2,35.621

I do@ @n't choose time and season any more than you do .
BENNETT-1911-2,35.622

Cedric . But surely , Fluff , this flight can proceed , as I say ,
wherever we are ? BENNETT-1911-2,35.623

Flora . You think so ? BENNETT-1911-2,35.624

And what about my grandstand ? BENNETT-1911-2,35.625

Cedric . I shall always be your grandstand . BENNETT-1911-2,35.626

Flora . Shall you ? BENNETT-1911-2,35.627

I can only do my best when I@ @'ve got the undivided attention of my
audience . BENNETT-1911-2,35.628

I hope I should never come <font> quite <$$font> to earth ,
BENNETT-1911-2,35.629

but I do@ @n't see myself being unique in my line for the benefit of a
man who is busy <paren> <font> with the faintest touch of irony in her
tone <$$font> <$$paren> counting the misfires in his motor , or dreaming
about the barometer . BENNETT-1911-2,35.630

Cedric . Naturally , if you do@ @n't see the importance of this Snowdon
business to us - BENNETT-1911-2,35.631

Flora . <paren> <font> Consciously very charming again . <$$font>
<$$paren> But I do see it perfectly well . BENNETT-1911-2,35.632

A woman unique in her own line is not necessarily a gaping idiot in
every other line . BENNETT-1911-2,35.633

I admit the immense importance of Snowdon to us . BENNETT-1911-2,35.634

I wo@ @n't argue . BENNETT-1911-2,35.635

In my time I@ @'ve been told that I was too well-dressed to be able to
argue . BENNETT-1911-2,35.636

I simply <P_36> want to ask you this - what , for you , is the <font>
most <$$font> important thing in life ? BENNETT-1911-2,36.637

Now , let@ @'s be straight . BENNETT-1911-2,36.638

Have you married as a supreme end , BENNETT-1911-2,36.639

or is your supreme end to move yourself about in the air without visible
means of support ? BENNETT-1911-2,36.640

Now <paren> <font> smiling <$$font> <$$paren> , look me in the face ,
BENNETT-1911-2,36.641

and be a man . BENNETT-1911-2,36.642

Cedric . You@ @'re putting very fundamental questions .
BENNETT-1911-2,36.643

Flora . Is marriage a relaxation from flying , BENNETT-1911-2,36.644

or do you fly in order to have the means for practising the whole art of
marriage under favourable conditions ? BENNETT-1911-2,36.645

Do you live most intensely when you@ @'re battling with the breeze , or
when you@ @'re <paren> <font> dropping her voice <$$font> <$$paren> with
me ? BENNETT-1911-2,36.646

I only want to know . BENNETT-1911-2,36.647

Because if you live most intensely when you@ @'re with me , this
honeymoon should be worth more to us than forty Snowdons .
BENNETT-1911-2,36.648

Cedric . <paren> <font> A little coldly . <$$font> <$$paren> Say no
more , BENNETT-1911-2,36.649

Snowdon is chucked . BENNETT-1911-2,36.650

Of course , my position is impossible . BENNETT-1911-2,36.651

You have only to insist . BENNETT-1911-2,36.652

Flora . <paren> <font> Losing her self-control . <$$font> <$$paren>
Insist ? BENNETT-1911-2,36.653

<font> Insist <$$font> that you neglect an aeroplane so that you can
stay with me ? BENNETT-1911-2,36.654

My dear boy , I@ @'m incapable of taking such a mean advantage of , an
aeroplane . BENNETT-1911-2,36.655

An aeroplane ca@ @n't insist . BENNETT-1911-2,36.656

And I can assure you I sha@ @n't . BENNETT-1911-2,36.657

Cedric . Do you know that you@ @'re scarcely logical ?
BENNETT-1911-2,36.658

<P_37>

Flora . Not logical ? In not insisting ? BENNETT-1911-2,37.660

Cedric . <paren> <font> Somewhat at a loss . <$$font> <$$paren> I mean
generally . BENNETT-1911-2,37.661

For instance , when we began , your first argument was that we could@
@n't shorten the honeymoon because the flat would@ @n't be ready .
BENNETT-1911-2,37.662

Flora . One ca@ @n't think of everything at once .
BENNETT-1911-2,37.663

You must@ @n't forget I@ @'ve never been called to the bar .
BENNETT-1911-2,37.664

If I@ @'d known what was coming , no doubt I should have prepared my
case and had it typewritten , and sent copies to the press ...
BENNETT-1911-2,37.665

And then what about your being illogical ? BENNETT-1911-2,37.666

Cedric . Me ? BENNETT-1911-2,37.667

Flora . Yes . When I ask you for a straight answer you protest that I@
@'m putting very fundamental questions . BENNETT-1911-2,37.668

Did you expect me to put shallow questions ? BENNETT-1911-2,37.669

Did you expect me to enquire whether you@ @'d used Pears' soap ?
BENNETT-1911-2,37.670

Cedric . Now look here , Fluffiest - BENNETT-1911-2,37.671

Flora . <paren> <font> Angry . <$$font> <$$paren> Cedric , I wish you
would@ @n't call me that . BENNETT-1911-2,37.672

You@ @'ve only started it since we were married . BENNETT-1911-2,37.673

I can stand Fluff , BENNETT-1911-2,37.674

but I do@ @n't like Fluffy , BENNETT-1911-2,37.675

and my objection to Fluffiest is intense . BENNETT-1911-2,37.676

Cedric . I beg your pardon . BENNETT-1911-2,37.677

Flora . <paren> <font> Recovering herself , sweetly . <$$font>
<$$paren> It@ @'s I who beg yours . BENNETT-1911-2,37.678

For the moment I was forgetting that " common superficial politeness "
which you ranked with common-sense . BENNETT-1911-2,37.679

<P_38>

Cedric . My dear child , everything@ @'s all right .
BENNETT-1911-2,38.681

The honeymoon shall not be shortened by a single day .
BENNETT-1911-2,38.682

Everything@ @'s absolutely all right . BENNETT-1911-2,38.683

Flora . <paren> <font> Shakes her head . <$$font> <$$paren>
BENNETT-1911-2,38.684

It is@ @n't . BENNETT-1911-2,38.685

You@ @'re only giving way to please me . BENNETT-1911-2,38.686

Cedric . Well , really - <paren> <font> laughing <$$font> <$$paren> .
BENNETT-1911-2,38.687

Flora . Cedric . Honestly . Yes or no . BENNETT-1911-2,38.688

Do you think I ought to yield to the aeroplane ? BENNETT-1911-2,38.689

Cedric . <paren> <font> They look at each other . <$$font> <$$paren> I
think you ought@ @n't to ask quite such questions ?
BENNETT-1911-2,38.690

Flora . <paren> <font> Agreeing . <$$font> <$$paren> No . Such
questions ought to be asked earlier . BENNETT-1911-2,38.691

But human nature is so - human , that probably it would@ @n't be any use
asking them any earlier . BENNETT-1911-2,38.692

They might even be considered rude . BENNETT-1911-2,38.693

In fact , it <font> is <$$font> considered rude for <font> fiance's
<$$font> to worry each other with any questions that really matter .
BENNETT-1911-2,38.694

<paren> <font> Pause . BENNETT-1911-2,38.695

In a vague voice . <$$font> <$$paren> Whether you prefer a flat or a
house , and the colour of the drawing-room chairs - that@ @'s about as
far as you are supposed to go . BENNETT-1911-2,38.696

<paren> <font> Another pause . <$$font> <$$paren> Well ?
BENNETT-1911-2,38.697

Cedric . <paren> <font> Approaching her . <$$font> <$$paren> What ?
BENNETT-1911-2,38.698

Flora . Do you think I ought to yield to the aeroplane ?
BENNETT-1911-2,38.699

Cedric . <paren> <font> Stands still , BENNETT-1911-2,38.700

very firmly . <$$font> <$$paren> My dear girl , if you ask me to be

Mrs. R. Haslam . <paren> <font> Sits . <$$font> <$$paren> Believe me

BENNETT-1911-2,40.743

Cedric . Look here , dad , do you mind telling me in one word what this

<P_41>

Mrs. R. Haslam . Yes , your father will tell you .
BENNETT-1911-2,41.746

The circumstances are exceedingly difficult - in fact , painful .
BENNETT-1911-2,41.747

But they have to be faced , and faced with dignity .
BENNETT-1911-2,41.748

The various necessary steps must be taken , in their proper order , very
carefully . BENNETT-1911-2,41.749

The first step is to inform you and Flora of the facts .
BENNETT-1911-2,41.750

Your father will inform you ; BENNETT-1911-2,41.751

as the head of the family , and the fount of authority , the statement
comes more properly from him . BENNETT-1911-2,41.752

I decided that absolutely as we motored down . BENNETT-1911-2,41.753

<paren> <font> To <$$font> Mr. Reach Haslam . <$$paren> Dear -

BENNETT-1911-2,41.758

As I said , the circumstances are painful , BENNETT-1911-2,41.759

but once faced as we shall face them , they really amount to nothing .
BENNETT-1911-2,41.760

The principal thing was to catch you in time . BENNETT-1911-2,41.761

Thank heaven , we@ @'ve done that ! BENNETT-1911-2,41.762

Charles . Thank my masterly and audacious driving !

Mr. R. Haslam . <paren> <font> Nodding to her politely . <$$font>
<$$paren> As soon as we had finished lunch your mother <P_42> set
herself to work , her work being very much ' behind -
BENNETT-1911-2,42.766

Mrs. R. Haslam . Never mind all that . BENNETT-1911-2,42.767

Do it as gently as you can , BENNETT-1911-2,42.768

but come to the point at once . BENNETT-1911-2,42.769

I am quite sure that is best . BENNETT-1911-2,42.770

Mr. R. Haslam . The telephone ? BENNETT-1911-2,42.771

Mrs. R. Haslam . The telephone . BENNETT-1911-2,42.772

Mr. R. Haslam . <paren> <font> Nodding to her politely . <$$paren>
<$$font> We were rung up on the telephone . BENNETT-1911-2,42.773

Your mother was walking about in meditation , BENNETT-1911-2,42.774

and as she was nearest to the telephone she answered it .
BENNETT-1911-2,42.775

She then said to me , " It@ @'s the Bishop of Colchester . "
BENNETT-1911-2,42.776

I was at the desk . BENNETT-1911-2,42.777

In another moment she asked me to come to the telephone and listen for
myself as she could scarcely believe her ears . BENNETT-1911-2,42.778

I did so , BENNETT-1911-2,42.779

and the Bishop - he was telephoning from the Palace at Colchester -
repeated at my request what he had said to your mother , namely , that
that curate who - er - officiated this morning , suddenly awakened to a
sense of beauty - BENNETT-1911-2,42.780

Mrs. R. Haslam . Sense of duty . BENNETT-1911-2,42.781

Mr. R. Haslam . I quite understood " beauty . "
BENNETT-1911-2,42.782

It@ @'s true the Bishop has@ @n't got a good telephone voice - probably
more impressive at a confirmation than on the telephone .
BENNETT-1911-2,42.783

I heard " beauty . " BENNETT-1911-2,42.784

However - BENNETT-1911-2,42.785

Mrs. R. Haslam . Sense of duty . BENNETT-1911-2,42.786

Mr. R. Haslam . No doubt you are right . BENNETT-1911-2,42.787

I <P_43> seemed to gather that it was Flora's beauty that had roused his
conscience . BENNETT-1911-2,43.788

Mrs. R. Haslam . Oh , no ! BENNETT-1911-2,43.789

Flora . That had what ? BENNETT-1911-2,43.790

Charles . <paren> <font> Coming towards the group , unable to control
his impatience . <$$font> <$$paren> Oh , hang it !
BENNETT-1911-2,43.791

The curate was a sham curate - not a curate at all .
BENNETT-1911-2,43.792

Cedric . <paren> <font> Taking it in . <$$font> <$$paren> A sham
curate ! BENNETT-1911-2,43.793

Flora . But surely such things do@ @n't happen ? BENNETT-1911-2,43.794

Mrs. R. Haslam . That@ @'s what many people said when I made a
shopwalker successfully personate an archdeacon in " The Woman of Kent .
" BENNETT-1911-2,43.795

Everyone said so until Mr. Gladstone wrote that he found the episode
quite convincing . BENNETT-1911-2,43.796

You remember , dear ? BENNETT-1911-2,43.797

Mr. R. Haslam . Vividly . BENNETT-1911-2,43.798

Mrs. R. Haslam . I assure you it happens quite frequently that from
one cause or another people who think they are married are not married .
BENNETT-1911-2,43.799

Why , sometimes special Acts of Parliament have to be passed in order to
set things right - when they@ @'ve gone altogether too far .
BENNETT-1911-2,43.800

I well recall that when I studied this subject , as of course I did ,
coming across a case in which , owing to a church having been
consecrated very carelessly , a lady who supposed herself to be the
legitimate mother of sixteen children - poor thing -
BENNETT-1911-2,43.801

Flora . <paren> <font> Interrupting . <$$font> <$$paren> But do you
mean to say we are@ @n't married ? BENNETT-1911-2,43.802

<P_44>

Mrs. R. Haslam . Well , of course , I want to put it as gently as
possible , BENNETT-1911-2,44.804

but the fact is <paren> <font> looking at her husband <$$font> <$$paren>
. BENNETT-1911-2,44.805

Mr. R. Haslam . It would be an exaggeration to say that you are
married . BENNETT-1911-2,44.806

Mrs. R. Haslam . If my idea had been accepted of having the Bishop to
officiate - and he would have been only too enchanted - in the cathedral
, this dreadful thing could not have occurred , BENNETT-1911-2,44.807

No case of personating a bishop has ever been known .
BENNETT-1911-2,44.808

Cedric . But what are we to do ? BENNETT-1911-2,44.809

Charles . <paren> <font> Airily . <$$font> <$$paren> Well , you must

Mrs. R. Haslam . <paren> <font> Outraged . <$$font> <$$paren>
Certainly not , Charles , you are astounding . BENNETT-1911-2,44.811

It would have looked better of you if you had remained outside in charge

<$$paren> My dear Mrs. Reach Haslam . BENNETT-1911-2,47.830

Not at all ! BENNETT-1911-2,47.831

I blush for my diocese - that such a deplorable and distressing accident
should have occurred in it . BENNETT-1911-2,47.832

Mrs. R. Haslam . Then it really is true ? BENNETT-1911-2,47.833

Bishop . But I told you on the telephone . BENNETT-1911-2,47.834

Mrs. R. Haslam . I know , BENNETT-1911-2,47.835

I know ! BENNETT-1911-2,47.836

I was only hoping against hope that perhaps after all you might have
found that the marriage was legal . BENNETT-1911-2,47.837

Bishop . <paren> <font> Shaking his head . <$$font> <$$paren> No .
BENNETT-1911-2,47.838

His late father was undoubtedly in orders , his late brother also .
BENNETT-1911-2,47.839

But he himself was no more ordained than you are .

<paren> <font> To <$$font> Mr. Reach Haslam , <font> who recoils .
<$$font> <$$paren> He presumed on his relationships ...
BENNETT-1911-2,47.841

In fact , his sole qualification seems to have been two old suits of his
brother's . BENNETT-1911-2,47.842

Mrs. R. Haslam . Well , after all , it is perhaps better so .
BENNETT-1911-2,47.843

Bishop . Better , dear lady ? BENNETT-1911-2,47.844

Mrs. R. Haslam . I mean that you have <font> not <$$font> brought

Really - <paren> <font> Looking at <$$font> Mr. Reach Haslam .
<$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,47.846

Mr. R. Haslam . <paren> <font> To whom the <$$font> Bishop , <font>

her novelist's instinct , perceives the situation that would be created
if we had to <P_48> go into the drawing-room now and say to them
suddenly , " Well , you are married , after all . "
BENNETT-1911-2,48.847

Mrs. R. Haslam . Excessively delicate . They would naturally leave
the house at once . BENNETT-1911-2,48.848

Bishop . Quite so . BENNETT-1911-2,48.849

I can@ @not tell you how relieved I was to get your wire saying that you
had overtaken them in time . BENNETT-1911-2,48.850

Young people make such a mystery of the honeymoon nowadays that often
they do@ @n't even leave a postal address . BENNETT-1911-2,48.851

A dangerous innovation ! BENNETT-1911-2,48.852

Mr. R. Haslam . Evidently . BENNETT-1911-2,48.853

Bishop . I gather that you have brought them both here , poor things !
BENNETT-1911-2,48.854

Mrs. R. Haslam . It seemed the wisest course . BENNETT-1911-2,48.855

I consulted my husband , BENNETT-1911-2,48.856

and he quite agreed with me that in view of the unusual circumstances we
ought to act with the greatest prudence - for <font> their <$$font>
sakes ! BENNETT-1911-2,48.857

And so we motored quietly back to town BENNETT-1911-2,48.858

and got here just in time for dinner . BENNETT-1911-2,48.859

My son drove . BENNETT-1911-2,48.860

I sat by his side . BENNETT-1911-2,48.861

There was@ @n't room for their heavy luggage , BENNETT-1911-2,48.862

and so Charlie is bringing that up by train . BENNETT-1911-2,48.863

Charles is my other son ... BENNETT-1911-2,48.864

<paren> <font> Sighs . <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,48.865

Mr. R. Haslam . Grimly . BENNETT-1911-2,49.878

That is - on the grim side . BENNETT-1911-2,49.879

Bishop . Ah ! BENNETT-1911-2,49.880

Mrs. R. Haslam . Of course , my Lord , we are taking it for granted
that the matter can be put right to-morrow , without fail , and beyond
question . BENNETT-1911-2,49.881

I have tried to comfort them with that absolute assurance .
BENNETT-1911-2,49.882

Bishop . My dear lady . Without fail ! At any hour ! <font> any
<$$font> hour ... up to three o'clock . BENNETT-1911-2,49.883

That is why I have come specially to town - to convince you by my

innocent victims , and my utter determination that the ceremony shall be
performed again to-morrow morning under my personal supervision and

<paren> Mr. Reach Haslam , <font> nodding , opens press cuttings .
<$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,50.895

Bishop . But for this unfortunate <font> contretemps <$$font> , what a
charming coincidence that your new book should be published to-day of
all days ! BENNETT-1911-2,50.896

Mrs. R. Haslam . So you find time in your busy life , Bishop , to
keep abreast of modern literature - even novels ? BENNETT-1911-2,50.897

Bishop . <font> Even <$$font> novels ! BENNETT-1911-2,50.898

My dear lady , there is no greater force for good .
BENNETT-1911-2,50.899

Mrs. R. Haslam . Or for evil - alas ! BENNETT-1911-2,50.900

Bishop . Quite so ! BENNETT-1911-2,50.901

I have often thought - I have indeed said so from the platform - that
the two most truly important influences for good in our generation are
your novels and the leaflets of the National Society for Promoting the
Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church .
BENNETT-1911-2,50.902

Mrs. R. Haslam . Indeed ! BENNETT-1911-2,50.903

Bishop . It was reported in our Diocesan Magazine .
BENNETT-1911-2,51.907

Mrs. R. Haslam . And yet , my dear Bishop , I have more than once
felt it my duty to criticise the Church rather sharply in my work .
BENNETT-1911-2,51.908

Bishop . I know , BENNETT-1911-2,51.909

Bishop . No , not yet . BENNETT-1911-2,51.915

But I have already ordered it from Boot's . BENNETT-1911-2,51.916

Mrs. R. Haslam . Boot's ? BENNETT-1911-2,51.917

Bishop . Yes , the cash chemists . BENNETT-1911-2,51.918

I find their circulating library the most economical of all .
BENNETT-1911-2,51.919

And I have to be particular . BENNETT-1911-2,51.920

As you know , I publish every year a detailed account of all my
expenditure , personal and otherwise , BENNETT-1911-2,51.921

and too large a sum for books might be misconstrued as self-indulgence ,

Bishop . <paren> <font> Looking up . <$$font> <$$paren> Twenty-one
columns ? BENNETT-1911-2,51.928

Mrs. R. Haslam . We are treating you without ceremony , my dear
Bishop . BENNETT-1911-2,51.929

My husband has <P_52> just calculated the total length of the reviews of
my book that have appeared in the London papers on the first day .
BENNETT-1911-2,52.930

Of course we attach no value whatever to the actual opinions expressed -
BENNETT-1911-2,52.931

the critics have to work in such a hurry - BENNETT-1911-2,52.932

and they are so sadly unfitted for their work , poor dears -
BENNETT-1911-2,52.933

but the amount of space given is an excellent indication of the public
importance ascribed to the book . BENNETT-1911-2,52.934

Bishop . <paren> <font> Who has been inspecting the book . <$$font>
<$$paren> How true ! BENNETT-1911-2,52.935

Mrs. R. Haslam . <paren> <font> To <$$font> Mr. Reach Haslam .
<$$paren> Anything special ? BENNETT-1911-2,52.936

Mr. R. Haslam . No . BENNETT-1911-2,52.937

" Surpassed herself , " seven or eight times . BENNETT-1911-2,52.938

" Masterpiece , " fourteen times . BENNETT-1911-2,52.939

The " Piccadilly Gazette " is unfavourable . BENNETT-1911-2,52.940

Mrs. R. Haslam . Very ? BENNETT-1911-2,52.941

Mr. R. Haslam . Yes . BENNETT-1911-2,52.942

Mrs. R. Haslam . Better tell me . BENNETT-1911-2,52.943

Mr. R. Haslam . <paren> <font> Deprecating gesture , reads .
<$$font> <$$paren> " The book is of course admirable in workmanship ,
knowledge , and insight , BENNETT-1911-2,52.944

but Mrs. Reach Haslam has not , if the truth must be told , surpassed
herself . " BENNETT-1911-2,52.945

Mrs. R. Haslam . If I@ @'d known about that when I saw their lady
reporter this morning ! ... BENNETT-1911-2,52.946

Bishop . <paren> <font> Putting the book down . <$$font> <$$paren>
Enthralling narrative ! BENNETT-1911-2,52.947

Enthralling ! BENNETT-1911-2,52.948

Now , my dear lady <paren> <font> rising <$$font> <$$paren> .
BENNETT-1911-2,52.949

<P_53>

Mrs. R. Haslam . <paren> <font> Interrupting him . <$$font>
<$$paren> Please sit down . BENNETT-1911-2,53.951

As you are having a glimpse of me in my profession to-night , I want to
ask you one or two professional questions - about the psychology of that
false curate . BENNETT-1911-2,53.952

Bishop . <paren> <font> Sitting down again . <$$font> <$$paren> Yes ,
yes . BENNETT-1911-2,53.953

Psychology . Just so . BENNETT-1911-2,53.954

Mrs. R. Haslam . I never lose an opportunity of gathering material .
BENNETT-1911-2,53.955

Father , will you mind taking down ? BENNETT-1911-2,53.956

My husband is good enough to act as my stenographer .
BENNETT-1911-2,53.957

Bishop . Touching ! BENNETT-1911-2,53.958

Mrs. Haslam . Now I noticed nothing remarkable about that curate .
BENNETT-1911-2,53.959

Bishop . <paren> <font> Agreeing . <$$font> <$$paren> No .
BENNETT-1911-2,53.960

And yet , you know - curious thing - he@ @'s a gentleman , quite ! Oh ,
quite ! BENNETT-1911-2,53.961

And I even remember once meeting his father , when I was Court Chaplain
, at a garden party in aid of the Additional Curates Society .
BENNETT-1911-2,53.962

Mr. R. Haslam . <paren> <font> Repeating what he has written .
<$$font> <$$paren> Curates Society . BENNETT-1911-2,53.963

Mrs. R. Haslam . But why should he choose to personate a curate ?
BENNETT-1911-2,53.964

That is what is so interesting to a novelist . BENNETT-1911-2,53.965

Why a curate ? BENNETT-1911-2,53.966

It could@ @n't have been for the money , or the glory .
BENNETT-1911-2,53.967

Mr. R. Haslam . Glory . BENNETT-1911-2,53.968

Bishop . The case is highly peculiar . BENNETT-1911-2,53.969

He is certainly not without means , or brains . BENNETT-1911-2,53.970

My <P_54> opinion is that his action was due to excessive intellectual
curiosity . BENNETT-1911-2,54.971

He told me he wanted to feel what it was like to be a curate .
BENNETT-1911-2,54.972

Mrs. R. Haslam . Yet he looked quite sane . BENNETT-1911-2,54.973

Bishop . Oh , quite ! BENNETT-1911-2,54.974

Astonishing story ! BENNETT-1911-2,54.975

His brother , through the influence of the Primate , had been engaged as
curate , by the Vicar of St. Saviour's , Colchester , subject to an
interview . BENNETT-1911-2,54.976

This brother had been doing some chaplaining in Switzerland - just rough
winter work . BENNETT-1911-2,54.977

On the way home he died suddenly in Paris . BENNETT-1911-2,54.978

Well , our friend of this morning calmly took up the dead man's identity
. BENNETT-1911-2,54.979

Came to Colchester , BENNETT-1911-2,54.980

conquered the simple Vicar , BENNETT-1911-2,54.981

and was at once accepted . BENNETT-1911-2,54.982

That was two months ago . BENNETT-1911-2,54.983

Mr. R. Haslam . Ago . BENNETT-1911-2,54.984

Mrs. R. Haslam . But how dangerous . BENNETT-1911-2,54.985

Bishop . So I pointed out to him . BENNETT-1911-2,54.986

His reply was that it was just the danger that had attracted him -
coupled with the desire to understand why the members of his family had
had such a passion for curacy . BENNETT-1911-2,54.987

It seems that two of his sisters have espoused curates .
BENNETT-1911-2,54.988

This will be a grievous blow for all of them . BENNETT-1911-2,54.989

Mr. R. Haslam . All of them . BENNETT-1911-2,54.990

Mrs. R. Haslam . But why should the man be struck with remorse just
now ? BENNETT-1911-2,54.991

Bishop . Well , his explanation is that he was so moved by the bride's
beauty . BENNETT-1911-2,54.992

<P_55>

Mr. R. Haslam . Duty . BENNETT-1911-2,55.994

Bishop . Beauty . BENNETT-1911-2,55.995

<paren> <font> Gesture of mild triumph from <$$font> Mr. Reach Haslam
<font> to <$$font> Mrs. Reach Haslam . <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,55.996

He could not bear to think that any action of his should cause - er -
inconvenience to a woman so beautiful . BENNETT-1911-2,55.997

Hence he came to me at once . BENNETT-1911-2,55.998

Fortunately I happened to be at the Palace . BENNETT-1911-2,55.999

Mrs. R. Haslam . Had he performed any other marriages ?
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1000

Bishop . Happily none ; BENNETT-1911-2,55.1001

but he had celebrated ten funerals and four baptisms .
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1002

However , these did not seem to trouble him in the least , I regret to
say . BENNETT-1911-2,55.1003

It was the wedding alone that roused his conscience .
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1004

Mr. R. Haslam . Conscience . BENNETT-1911-2,55.1005

Mrs. R. Haslam . Of course you sent for the police .
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1006

Bishop . I trust and believe that he is now in prison .
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1007

But I did not send for the police . BENNETT-1911-2,55.1008

The Church has its dignity to maintain against the civil judicature in
these modern days . BENNETT-1911-2,55.1009

Also with so much irreligion - shall I say ? - flaunting in the very
air , she {TEXT:She} must avoid scandal - particularly local scandal .
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1010

London scandal is less deleterious . BENNETT-1911-2,55.1011

Accordingly I brought the young man up to town with me ,
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1012

and I put him into a cab for the police-station , where he will
surrender himself of his own free will to the law .
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1013

I prefer that <P_56> way . BENNETT-1911-2,56.1014

It is , perhaps , original ; BENNETT-1911-2,56.1015

but nowadays we Bishops have to be original . BENNETT-1911-2,56.1016

Mrs. R. Haslam . But do you really suppose he has surrendered ?
BENNETT-1911-2,56.1017

Bishop . I am sure of it . BENNETT-1911-2,56.1018

I can@ @not pretend to your skill in reading character , dear lady ,
BENNETT-1911-2,56.1019

but I know a gentleman at sight . BENNETT-1911-2,56.1020

Mr. R. Haslam . Sight . BENNETT-1911-2,56.1021

Mrs. R. Haslam . Of course , if one put such a story into a novel ,
it would never be believed . BENNETT-1911-2,56.1022

That@ @'s the worst of real life . BENNETT-1911-2,56.1023

Bishop . And yet this distressing affair reminded me strongly of the
false archdeacon in " The Woman of Kent . " BENNETT-1911-2,56.1024

Mrs. R. Haslam . <paren> <font> Pleased . <$$font> <$$paren> Ah !
You remember my early book ? BENNETT-1911-2,56.1025

Bishop . <paren> <font> Protestingly . <$$font> <$$paren> My dear lady
! You have no more earnest student ! BENNETT-1911-2,56.1026

And may I add that from the first I found that episode of the false
archdeacon entirely convincing . BENNETT-1911-2,56.1027
