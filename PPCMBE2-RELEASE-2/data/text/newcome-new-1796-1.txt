The Gospel according to St. John . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.4

<$$heading>

The Word was in the beginning , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.6

and the Word was with God , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.7

and the Word was God . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.8

This <font> Word <$$font> was in the beginning with God .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.9

All things were made by him ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.10

and without him was not any thing made that was made .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.11

In him was life ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.12

and the life was the light of men . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.13

And the light shone in darkness ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.14

and the darkness overspread it not . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.15

There was a man sent from God , whose name <font> was <$$font> John .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.16

This man came for a testimony , to testify of the Light ; <font> so
<$$font> that through him all might believe .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.17

He was not that Light , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.18

but <font> was sent <$$font> to testify of that Light .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.19

<font> That <$$font> was the true Light , which enlighteneth every man ,
coming into the world . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.20

He was in the world , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.21

and the world was made by him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.22

and yet the world knew him not . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.23

He came to his own ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.24

and yet those who were his own received him not .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.25

But as many as received him , to them he gave power to become children
of God , <font> even <$$font> to them who believe in his name : who were
born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of
man , but of God . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.26

And the Word became flesh , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.27

and dwelt among us <paren> and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the
only-begotten <font> who came <$$font> from the Father <$$paren> full of
favour and of truth . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.28

John bare witness of him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.29

and cried , saying ; " This was he of whom I spake ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.30

' He who Cometh after me , goeth before me ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.31

for he was before me , ' {COM:missing_close_double_quote}
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.32

And of his fullness we have all received ; and favour upon favour .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.33

For the law was given by Moses ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.34

<font> but <$$font> favour and truth came by Jesus Christ .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.35

No man hath seen God at any time ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.36

the only-begotten <bracket> Son <$$bracket> that is in the bosom of the
Father , he hath declared <font> him . <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.37

And this is the witness of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites
from Jerusalem , to ask him ; " Who art Thou ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.38

<P_1,20J>

and he confessed , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.40

and denied not , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.41

but confessed , " I am not the Christ . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.42

And they asked him ; " What then ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.43

Art thou Elijah ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.44

and he saith , " I am not . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.45

" Art thou a prophet ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.46

and he answered , " No . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.47

Then they said unto him ; " Who art thou ? that we may give an answer
to those who sent us . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.48

What sayest thou of thyself ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.49

He said ; " I <font> am <$$font> the voice of one crying in the desert ,
' Make straight the way of the Lord : ' as said the prophet Isaiah . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.50

Now those who had been sent were of the Pharisees .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.51

Then they asked him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.52

and said unto him ; " Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not the
Christ , nor Elijah , nor a prophet ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.53

John answered them , saying ; " I baptize with water :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.54

but there standeth one amidst you , whom ye know not ; <font> even
<$$font> he who cometh after me ; the latchet of whose sandal I am not
worthy to unloose . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.55

These things passed in Bethabara beyond Jordan , where John was
baptizing . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.56

The next day John beholdeth Jesus coming unto him ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.57

and saith ; " See , the Lamb of God , who taketh away the sin of the
world . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.58

This is he of whom I said ; ' After me cometh a man , who goeth before
me ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.59

for he was before me . ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.60

And I knew him not : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.61

but I therefore came baptizing with water , that he might be made
manifest to Israel . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.62

John also bare witness , saying ; " I saw the Spirit coming down from
heaven as a dove ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.63

and it abode upon him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.64

And I knew him not <font> then : <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.65

but he who sent me to baptize with water had said unto me ; ' Upon whom
thou shalt see the Spirit coming down and abiding , this is he who
baptizeth with the Holy Spirit . ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.66

And I saw , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.67

and bare witness that this is the Son of God . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.68

<font> On <$$font> the next day , John was again standing , and two of
his disciples : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.69

and he looked on Jesus <font> who was <$$font> walking ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.70

and saith ; " Behold the Lamb of God . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.71

And the two disciples heard him speak , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.72

and followed Jesus . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.73

Then Jesus turned , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.74

and saw them following , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.75

and saith unto them ; " What seek ye ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.76

And they said unto him ; " Rabbi , <paren> which signifieth , being
interpreted , Master <$$paren> where dwellest thou ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.77

He saith unto them ; " Come and see . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.78

They came NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.79

and saw where he dwelt , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.80

and abode with him that day : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.81

<paren> <font> now <$$font> it was about the tenth hour . <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.82

<P_1,40J>

One of the two that heard John <font> speak <$$font> , and followed
<font> Jesus <$$font> was Andrew , Simon Peter's brother .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.84

He meeteth with his own brother Simon first <font> of any <$$font> ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.85

and saith to him ; " We have found the Messiah : " <paren> which is ,
being interpreted , <font> the <$$font> Christ . <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.86

And <font> Andrew <$$font> brought him to Jesus .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.87

And Jesus looked on him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.88

and said ; " Thou art Simon the son of Jonah :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.89

thou shalt be called Cephas : " <paren> which being interpreted , is , a
rock . <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.90

The day following , Jesus purposed to go into Galilee ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.91

and meeteth with Philip , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.92

and saith unto him , " Follow me . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.93

Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.94

Philip meeteth with Nathanael , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.95

and saith unto him ; " We have found him of whom Moses in the law , and
the prophets <font> also , <$$font> wrote , Jesus of Nazareth , the son
of Joseph . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.96

Then Nathanael said unto him ; " Can any good thing come out of Nazareth
? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.97

Philip saith unto him ; " Come and see . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.98

Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.99

and saith of him ; " Behold an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile .
" NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.100

Nathanael saith unto him ; " Whence knowest thou Me ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.101

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.102

and said unto him ; " Before Philip called thee , when thou wast under
the fig-tree , I saw thee . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.103

Nathanael answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.104

and saith unto him ; " Master , thou art the Son of God ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.105

thou art the King of Israel . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.106

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.107

and said unto him ; " Because I said unto thee , ' I saw thee under the
fig-tree , ' believest thou ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.108

thou shalt see greater things than these . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.109

Then <font> Jesus <$$font> saith unto him ; " Verily verily I say unto
you , <bracket> Hereafter <$$bracket> ye shall see heaven opened , and
the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.110

<P_2,1J>

And the third day there was a marriage-feast in Cana of Galilee ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.112

and the mother of Jesus was there : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.113

And Jesus and his disciples also were invited to the marriage-feast .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.114

And when <font> the <$$font> wine failed , the mother of Jesus saith
unto him ; " They have no wine . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.115

Jesus saith unto her ; " Woman , what have I to do with thee ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.116

mine hour is not yet come . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.117

His mother saith to the servants ; " Whatsoever he saith unto you , do
<font> it <$$font> . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.118

Now six water-pots of stone were placed there , according to the manner
of cleansing among the Jews , containing two or three baths apiece .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.119

Jesus saith unto them ; " Fill the water-pots with water . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.120

And they filled them to the brim . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.121

Then he saith unto them ; " Draw out now , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.122

and bear to the governour of the feast . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.123

And they bare <font> it . <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.124

And when the governour of the feast had tasted the water which was made
wine , and knew not whence it was ; <paren> but the servants who drew
the water knew ; <$$paren> the governour of the feast calleth the
bridegroom , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.125

and saith unto him ; " Every man at first setteth on good wine ; and
when men have drunk largely , then that which is worse :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.126

<font> but <$$font> thou hast kept the good wine until now . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.127

This beginning of miracles Jesus made in Cana of Galilee ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.128

and manifested his glory : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.129

and his disciples believed in him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.130

After this , he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his
brethren , and his disciples : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.131

and they remained there not many days . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.132

Now the passover of the Jews was near ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.133

and Jesus went up to Jerusalem ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.134

and found in the temple those who sold cattle , and sheep , and doves ,
and the money-changers sitting : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.135

and , when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out
of the temple , and the sheep , and the cattle ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.136

and poured out the money of the exchangers , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.137

and overturned <font> their <$$font> tables ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.138

and said to those who sold doves ; " Take these things hence ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.139

make not my Father's house an house of merchandise . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.140

And his disciples remembered , that it was written ; " A zeal for thine
house consumeth me . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.141

Then the Jews spake NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.142

and said unto him ; " What sign shewest thou unto us , since thou doest
these things ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.143

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.144

and said unto them ; " Destroy this temple , and in three days I will
raise it up . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.145

<P_2,20J>

Then the Jews said ; " Forty_and_six years hath this temple been in
building ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.147

and wilt Thou raise it up in three days ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.148

But he spake concerning the temple of his body .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.149

When therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered
that he had said this <bracket> unto them : <$$bracket>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.150

and they believed the scripture , and the words which Jesus had spoken .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.151

Now , when he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the passover , many
believed on his name , when they beheld the miracles which he did .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.152

But Jesus did not trust himself to them , because he knew all <font> of
them : <$$font> and because he needed not that any should testify of man
: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.153

for he himself knew what was in man . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.154

<P_3,1J>

Now there was a man of the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a ruler of the
Jews : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.156

this man came to <font> Jesus <$$font> by night ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.157

and said unto him ; " Master , we know that thou art a teacher come from
God : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.158

for no man can do these miracles which thou doest , unless God be with
him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.159

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.160

and said unto him ; " Verily verily I say unto thee , Unless a man be
born again , he can@ @not see the kingdom of God . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.161

Nicodemus saith unto him ; " How can a man be born when he is old ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.162

can he enter a second time into his mother's womb , and be born ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.163

Jesus answered ; " Verily verily I say unto thee , Unless a man be born
of water , and <font> of <$$font> the Spirit , he can@ @not enter into
the kingdom of God . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.164

That which is born of the flesh , is flesh ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.165

and that which is born of the Spirit , is spirit .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.166

Wonder not that I said unto thee , Ye must be born again .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.167

The wind bloweth where it will , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.168

and thou hearest its {TEXT:it's} sound , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.169

but knowest not whence it cometh , and whither it goeth :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.170

so is every one that is born of the Spirit . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.171

Nicodemus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.172

and said unto him ; " How can these things be ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.173

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.174

and said unto him ; " Art thou a teacher in Israel ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.175

and knowest not these things ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.176

Verily verily I say unto thee , We speak that which we know ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.177

and testify that which we have seen ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.178

and yet ye receive not our testimony . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.179

If I have told you earthly things , and ye believe not ; how will ye
believe , if I tell you heavenly things ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.180

Now no man goeth up to heaven , but he who came down from heaven ,
<font> even <$$font> the Son of man , who was in heaven .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.181

And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert , so must the Son of
man be lifted up that every one who believeth in him may <bracket> not
perish , but <$$bracket> have everlasting life .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.182

For God hath so loved the world , that he hath given his only-begotten
Son , that everyone who believeth in him may not perish , but have
everlasting life . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.183

For God hath not sent his Son into the world , to condemn the world ;
but that the world through him might be saved .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.184

He who believeth in him , shall not be condemned :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.185

but he that believeth not , is condemned already , because he hath not
believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.186

And this is the condemnation ; that light is come into the world , and
yet men have loved darkness rather than light :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.187

for their deeds were evil : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.188

<P_3,20J>

for every one who doeth evil hateth the light ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.190

and cometh not to the light , lest his deeds should be discovered .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.191

But he who doeth the truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be
made manifest , that they are wrought <font> through faith <$$font> in
God . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.192

After these things , Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea
; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.193

and there he tarried with them , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.194

and baptized . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.195

And John also was baptizing in Enon , near Salim ; because much water
was there ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.196

and <font> the people <$$font> came , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.197

and were baptized . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.198

For John was not yet cast into prison . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.199

Then a question arose between <font> some <$$font> of John's disciples
and a Jew , about baptizing . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.200

And <font> some <$$font> came to John , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.201

and said unto him ; " Master , he that was with thee beyond Jordan , to
whom thou barest witness , behold , he baptizeth ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.202

and all <font> men <$$font> come to him . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.203

John answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.204

and said ; " A man can receive nothing , unless it be given him from
heaven . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.205

Ye yourselves bear me witness , that I said ; ' I am not the Christ ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.206

but I am sent before his face . ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.207

He that hath the bride , is the bridegroom :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.208

but the friend of the bridegroom , who standeth and heareth him ,
rejoiceth greatly , because of the bridegroom's voice .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.209

This my joy therefore is complete . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.210

He must increase , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.211

but I <font> must <$$font> decrease . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.212

He that cometh from above , is above all : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.213

he that is from the earth , is from the earth ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.214

and speaketh from the earth : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.215

he that cometh from heaven <bracket> is above all ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.216

and <$$bracket> testifieth what he hath seen and heard ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.217

and yet none receiveth his testimony . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.218

He that hath received his testimony , hath set his seal <font> to
confirm <$$font> that God is true . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.219

For he whom God hath sent , speaketh the words of God :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.220

for <bracket> God <$$bracket> giveth him not the Spirit by measure .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.221

The Father loveth the Son , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.222

and hath given all things into his hand . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.223

He who believeth on the Son , hath everlasting life :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.224

and he who disbelieveth the Son , will not see life ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.225

but the anger of God abideth on him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.226

<P_4,1J>

When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that he made
and baptized more disciples than John ; <paren> though Jesus himself
baptized not , but <font> his <$$font> disciples ; <$$paren> he left
Judea , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.228

and went again into Galilee . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.229

Now he must needs go through Samaria . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.230

He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria , called Sychar , near to the
portion of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.231

Now Jacob's well was there . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.232

So Jesus , being wearied with <font> his <$$font> journey , sat
afterward on the well . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.233

<paren> It was about the sixth hour . <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.234

A woman of Samaria cometh to draw water . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.235

Jesus saith unto her ; " Give me to drink . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.236

<paren> For his disciples were gone to the city , that they might buy
food . <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.237

Then the Samaritan woman saith unto him ; " Why dost thou , being a Jew
, ask drink of me , that am a Samaritan ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.238

<paren> for the Jews have no <font> friendly <$$font> dealings with the
Samaritans . <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.239

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.240

and said unto her ; " If thou knewest the bounty of God , and who he is
that saith unto thee , ' Give me to drink ; ' thou wouldest have asked
of him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.241

and he would have given thee living water . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.242

The woman saith unto him ; " Sir , thou hast no vessel to draw with ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.243

and the well is deep : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.244

whence then canst thou have that living water ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.245

Art thou greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well , and
himself drank of it , and his sons , and his cattle ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.246

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.247

and said unto her ; " Whosoever drinketh of this water , will thirst
again : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.248

but whosoever shall drink of the water which I {TEXT:I_which} shall give
him , will never thirst ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.249

but the water which I shall give him will be in him a well of water
springing up to everlasting life . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.250

The woman saith unto him ; " Sir , give me this water ; that I thirst
not , nor come hither to draw . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.251

Jesus saith unto her ; " Go , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.252

call thine husband , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.253

and come hither . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.254

The woman answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.255

and said ; " I have no husband . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.256

Jesus saith unto her ; " Thou hast rightly said , ' I have no husband :
' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.257

for thou hast had five husbands ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.258

and he whom thou now hast , is not thine husband :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.259

thou hast spoken this truly . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.260

The woman saith unto him ; " Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.261

<P_4,20J>

Our fathers worshipped on this mountain ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.263

and ye say ; that in Jerusalem is the place where <font> men <$$font>
ought to worship . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.264

Jesus saith unto her ; " Woman , believe me , the hour cometh when ye
shall worship the Father neither on this mountain nor at Jerusalem .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.265

Ye worship what ye know not : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.266

we worship what we know : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.267

for salvation is from the Jews . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.268

But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers will
worship the Father in spirit and <font> in <$$font> truth :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.269

for indeed the Father seeketh such worshippers of him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.270

God <font> is <$$font> a spirit : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.271

and the worshippers of him ought to worship <font> him <$$font> in
spirit and <font> in <$$font> truth . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.272

The woman saith unto him ; " I know that <font> the <$$font> Messiah
cometh : <paren> which signifieth <font> the <$$font> Christ : <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.273

when he is come , he will tell us all things . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.274

Jesus saith unto her ; " I , who talk with thee , am <font> he <$$font>
. " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.275

And upon this his disciples came , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.276

and wondered that he talked with the woman :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.277

yet none said ; " What seekest thou ? " or , " Why talkest thou with
her ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.278

The woman then left her bucket , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.279

and went into the city , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.280

and saith to the men ; " Come , see a man who hath told me all things
whatever I did : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.281

is this the Christ ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.282

<font> Then <$$font> they went out of the city ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.283

and came unto him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.284

In the mean time his disciples besought him , saying ; " Master , eat .
" NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.285

But he said unto them ; " I have food to eat , which ye know not of . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.286

Then the disciples said one to another ; " Hath any one brought him
<font> any thing <$$font> to eat ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.287

Jesus saith unto them ; " My food is , to do the will of him who sent me
, and to finish his work . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.288

Say ye not , ' There are yet four months , and <font> then <$$font>
cometh the harvest ? ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.289

behold , I say unto you , Lift up your eyes ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.290

and look on the fields ; that they are already white for harvest .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.291

<font> And <$$font> he who reapeth receiveth wages ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.292

and gathereth a crop , to everlasting life : that both he who soweth ,
and he who reapeth , may rejoice together .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.293

For herein is that saying true ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.294

' One soweth , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.295

and another reapeth . ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.296

I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.297

others have laboured , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.298

and ye are entered into their labours . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.299

And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him , for the words
of the woman who testified ; " He told me all things whatever I did . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.300

<P_4,40J>

When therefore the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him
that he would abide with them : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.302

and he abode there two day's . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.303

And many more believed because of his own words ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.304

and said to the woman ; " We no longer believe because of thy report :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.305

for we ourselves have heard him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.306

and know that this is indeed <bracket> the Christ , <$$bracket> the
Saviour of the world . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.307

Now after the two days he departed thence , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.308

and went into Galilee . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.309

For Jesus himself declared that a prophet hath no honour in his own
country . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.310

So when he was come into Galilee , the Galileans received him , having
seen all the things which he did in Jerusalem at the feast :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.311

for they also had gone to the feast . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.312

So <font> Jesus <$$font> came again to Cana of Galilee , where he had
made the water wine . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.313

And there was one of the king's household , whose son was sick at
Capernaum . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.314

This man , when he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee ,
went to him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.315

and besought <bracket> him <$$bracket> that he would come down and cure
his son : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.316

for he was at the point of death . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.317

Then Jesus said unto him ; " Unless ye see signs and wonders , ye will
not believe . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.318

He of the king's household saith unto him ; " Sir , come down , before
my child die . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.319

Jesus saith unto him ; " Depart ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.320

thy son liveth . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.321

And the man believed the words which Jesus had spoken unto him ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.322

and departed . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.323

And as he was now going down , his servants met him ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.324

and told <font> him , <$$font> saying ; " Thy son liveth . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.325

Then he enquired of them the hour when <font> his son <$$font> began to
amend . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.326

And they said unto him ; " Yesterday , at the seventh hour , the fever
left him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.327

So the father knew that <font> it was <$$font> at the very hour , in
which Jesus had said unto him ; " Thy son liveth . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.328

And himself believed , and his whole house .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.329

This second miracle Jesus did , when he had come out of Judea into
Galilee . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.330

<P_5,1J>

After these things there was a feast of the Jews ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.332

and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.333

Now there is at Jerusalem , by the <font> sheep-gate <$$font>
{COM:font_change_around_"gate"} , a pool , which is called in the Hebrew
<font> tongue <$$font> Bethesda , having five porches .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.334

In these lay a <bracket> great <$$bracket> multitude of infirm persons ,
of blind , lame , withered , <bracket> looking for the moving of the
water . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.335

For at a certain season an angel went down into the pool ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.336

and troubled the water : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.337

whosoever therefore went in first , after the troubling of the water ,
was made well , whatever disease he had . <$$bracket>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.338

And a certain man was there , that had an infirmity thirty_and_eight
years . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.339

When Jesus saw him lying , and knew that he had been now a long time
<font> afflicted , <$$font> he saith unto him ; " Dost thou desire to be
made well ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.340

The infirm man answered him ; " Sir , I have no man , when the water is
troubled , to put me into the pool : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.341

but while I am coming , another goeth down before me . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.342

Jesus saith unto him ; " Rise , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.343

take up thy couch , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.344

and walk . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.345

And immediately the man was made well , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.346

and took up his couch , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.347

and walked . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.348

Now on that day was the sabbath . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.349

The Jews therefore said to him that was cured ; " It is the sabbath :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.350

it is not lawful for thee to take up <font> thy <$$font> couch . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.351

He answered them ; He who made me well , himself said unto me ; " Take
up thy couch , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.352

and walk . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.353

Then they asked him ; " What man is that who said unto thee , ' Take up
thy couch , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.354

and walk ? ' " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.355

But he that was cured knew not who it was : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.356

for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in <font> that
<$$font> place . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.357

Afterward Jesus meeteth with him in the temple ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.358

and said unto him ; " Behold , thou art made well :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.359

sin no more , lest some worse thing befal thee . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.360

The man departed , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.361

and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.362

And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus , because he had done these
things on the sabbath . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.363

But Jesus said unto them ; " My Father worketh until now ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.364

and I <font> also <$$font> work . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.365

Wherefore for this the Jews sought the more to kill him ; because he not
only had broken the sabbath , but said also that God was his Father ,
making himself like God . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.366

Jesus therefore spake NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.367

and said unto them ; " Verily verily I say unto you , The Son can do
nothing of himself ; but what he seeth the Father do :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.368

for what things <font> the Father <$$font> doeth , these the Son also
doeth in like manner . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.369

<P_5,20J>

For the Father loveth the Son , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.371

and sheweth him all things which he himself doeth :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.372

and he will shew him greater works than these , so that ye will wonder .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.373

For as the Father raiseth up the dead , and giveth <font> them <$$font>
life ; so the Son likewise giveth life to whom he will .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.374

For neither doth the Father judge any man : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.375

but hath committed all judgement to the Son ; that all may honour the
Son , as they honour the Father . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.376

He that honoureth not the Son , honoureth not the Father who sent him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.377

Verily verily I say unto you , He that hearkeneth to my words , and
believeth in him who sent me , hath everlasting life ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.378

and shall not come into condemnation , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.379

but passeth from death to life . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.380

Verily verily I say unto you , The hour cometh , and now is , when the
dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.381

and they that hear shall live . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.382

For as the Father hath life in himself , so hath he given to the Son
also to have life in himself : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.383

and he hath given him authority to exercise judgement also , because he
is the Son of man . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.384

Wonder not at this : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.385

for the hour cometh , in which all that are in the sepulchres shall hear
his voice , and shall come forth ; they that have done good , to the
resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , to the
resurrection of condemnation . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.386

Of myself I can do nothing : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.387

as I hear , I judge : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.388

and my judgement is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the
will of him who sent me . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.389

If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.390

There is another who beareth witness of me ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.391

and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.392

Ye sent unto John , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.393

and he bare witness to the truth . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.394

Yet I receive not witness from man : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.395

but I say these things , that ye may be saved .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.396

He was a burning and shining lamp : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.397

and ye were willing to rejoice for a time in his light .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.398

But I have greater witness than <font> that <$$font> of John :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.399

for the works which the Father hath given me to perform , these works
which I do , bear witness of me that the Father hath sent me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.400

And the Father himself , who sent me , hath borne witness of me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.401

Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his form .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.402

And ye have not his word abiding in you : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.403

for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.404

" Search the scriptures ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.405

for in them ye think that ye have everlasting life :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.406

and they bear witness of me : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.407

<P_5,40J>

and yet ye are not willing to come unto me , that ye may have life .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.409

I receive not honour from men : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.410

but I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.411

I am come in my Father's name , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.412

and yet ye receive me not : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.413

if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.414

How can Ye believe , who receive honour from one another , and seek not
the honour which <font> cometh <$$font> from the only God ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.415

Think not that I will accuse you to the Father :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.416

there is <font> one <$$font> that accuseth you , <font> even <$$font>
Moses , in whom ye trust . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.417

For if ye had believed Moses , ye would have believed me :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.418

for he wrote of me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.419

But if ye believe not his writings , how will ye believe my words ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.420

<P_6,1J>

After these things Jesus went over the lake of Galilee , which is <font>
the lake <$$font> of Tiberias . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.422

And a great multitude followed him , because they saw the miracles which
he did on those who were diseased . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.423

And Jesus went up a mountain , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.424

and sat there with his disciples . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.425

Now the passover , <paren> a feast of the Jews , <$$paren> was nigh .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.426

When Jesus then lifted up <font> his <$$font> eyes , and saw that a
great multitude was coming to him , he saith to Philip ; " Whence shall
we buy bread , that these may eat ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.427

<paren> Now he said this to try him : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.428

for he himself knew what he was about to do . <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.429

Philip answered him ; " Bread , worth two_hundred denarii , is not
sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.430

One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter's brother , saith unto him ;
" There is a child here , that hath five barley-loaves , and two fishes
: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.431

but what are They among so many ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.432

And Jesus said ; " Make the men place themselves on the ground . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.433

<paren> Now there was much grass in the place . <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.434

So the men placed themselves on the ground , in number about
five_thousand . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.435

And Jesus took the loaves ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.436

and , when he had given thanks , he distributed <bracket> to the
disciples , and the disciples <$$bracket> to those that were on the
ground : and in like manner of the fishes , as much as they would .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.437

And when they were filled , he saith to his disciples ; " Gather the
fragments which remain , that nothing be lost . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.438

They therefore gathered <font> them , <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.439

and filled twelve panniers with the fragments of the five barley-loaves
, which remained to those that had eaten . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.440

Then those men , when they had seen the miracle which Jesus did , said ;
" This is in truth that prophet who was to come into the world . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.441

When Jesus therefore perceived that they were about to come and take him
by force , to make him a king , he withdrew <bracket> again <$$bracket>
to a mountain himself alone . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.442

And when evening came , his disciples went down to the lake ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.443

and entered into a ship , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.444

and went over the lake toward Capernaum . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.445

And it was now dark ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.446

and Jesus was not come to them . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.447

And the lake rose , because of a great wind which blew .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.448

So when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs , they see
Jesus walking on the lake , and drawing near to the ship :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.449

and they were afraid . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.450

<P_6,20J>

But he saith unto them ; " It is I : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.452

be not afraid . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.453

Then they were glad to receive him into the ship :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.454

and immediately the ship was at the land whither they were going .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.455

The day following , when the multitude who stood on the other side of
the lake saw that there was none other boat there but one , and that
Jesus had not gone with his disciples into the ship , but <font> that
<$$font> his disciples had departed alone ; <paren> however there came
other boats from Tiberias , near the place where they ate bread , after
the Lord had given thanks ; <$$paren> when the people therefore saw that
neither Jesus was there , nor his disciples , they took shipping ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.456

and came to Capernaum , seeking Jesus . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.457

And when they had found him on the other side of the lake , they said
unto him ; " Master , when camest thou hither ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.458

Jesus answered them NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.459

and said ; " Verily verily I say unto you , Ye seek me , not because ye
have seen miracles , but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.460

Work not so much for the food which perisheth , as for the food which
endureth to everlasting life , which the Son of man will give you :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.461

for him hath the Father sealed , <font> even <$$font> God . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.462

They said therefore unto him ; " What shall we do , that we may work the
works of God ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.463

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.464

and said unto them ; " This is the work of God , that ye believe on him
whom he hath sent . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.465

Then they said unto him ; " What miracle <bracket> therefore <$$bracket>
doest thou , that we may see <font> it , <$$font> and believe in thee ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.466

what dost thou work ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.467

Our fathers ate manna in the desert : as it is written , '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.468

He gave them bread from heaven to eat . ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.469

Jesus <bracket> therefore <$$bracket> said unto them ; Verily verily I
say unto you , Moses gave you not the bread from heaven ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.470

but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.471

For the bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven , and giveth
life to the world . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.472

Then they said unto him ; " Master , always give us this bread . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.473

And Jesus said unto them ; " I am the bread of life :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.474

he who cometh to me , shall never hunger ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.475

and he who believeth in me , shall never thirst .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.476

But I have said unto you , that ye have both seen me and believe not .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.477

All whom the Father giveth me , will come to me ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.478

and him who cometh to me , I will in no wise cast out .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.479

For I am come down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will
of him who sent me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.480

And this is the will of him who sent me , that of all whom he hath given
me I should lose none , but should raise them up at the last day .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.481

<P_6,40J>

For this is the will of him who sent me , that every one who seeth the
Son , and believeth in him , may have everlasting life :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.483

and him I will raise up at the last day . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.484

The Jews then murmured at him , because he said ; ' I am the bread which
came down from heaven : ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.485

and said ; " Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and
mother we know ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.486

how therefore doth this man say , ' I came down from heaven ? ' "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.487

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.488

and said unto them ; " Murmur not among yourselves .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.489

No man can come to me , unless the Father , who sent me , draw him :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.490

and him I will raise up at the last day . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.491

It is written in the prophets ; ' And all shall be taught of God . '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.492

Every one that hath heard and learned from the Father , cometh unto me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.493

Not that any <font> man <$$font> hath seen the Father ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.494

but he that is from God ; he hath seen the Father .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.495

Verily verily I say unto you , He who believeth in me , hath everlasting
life . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.496

I am the bread of life . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.497

Your fathers ate manna in the desert , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.498

and died . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.499

This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat of
it , and not die . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.500

I am the living bread which came down from heaven :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.501

if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.502

and the bread which I will give , is my flesh which I will give for the
life of the world . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.503

The Jews therefore contended among themselves , saying ; " How can this
man give us <font> his <$$font> flesh to eat ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.504

Jesus therefore said unto them ; " Verily verily I say unto you , Unless
ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have not
life in you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.505

He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath everlasting life
; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.506

and him I will raise up at the last day . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.507

For my flesh is truly food , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.508

and my blood is truly drink . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.509

He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , abideth in me , and I
in him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.510

As the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father ; so he
likewise that eateth me , shall live by me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.511

This is the bread which came down from heaven : not as <bracket> your
<$$bracket> fathers ate <bracket> manna , <$$bracket> and died .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.512

He that eateth of this bread , shall live for ever . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.513

He said these things in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.514

<P_6,60J>

Many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard <font> him ,
<$$font> said ; " This is hard doctrine : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.516

who can understand it ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.517

But when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at this , he
said unto them ; " Doth this cause you to offend ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.518

<font> What <$$font> then if ye shall see the Son of man going up where
he was before ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.519

It is the spirit that giveth life ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.520

the flesh profiteth nothing : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.521

the words which I speak unto you , <font> they <$$font> are spirit ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.522

and <font> they <$$font> are life . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.523

But there are some of you that believe not . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.524

<paren> For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed
not , and who was to deliver him up . <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.525

Then he said ; " For this cause I said unto you , that none can come
unto me , unless it be given unto him by my Father . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.526

From that <font> time <$$font> many of his disciples went back ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.527

and walked no more with him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.528

Jesus therefore said to the twelve ; " Will Ye also depart ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.529

Simon Peter answered him ; " Master , to whom shall we go ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.530

thou hast the words of everlasting life : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.531

and we believe , and know , that thou art the Holy One of God . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.532

Jesus answered them ; " Have not I chosen you twelve ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.533

and yet one of you is a false accuser . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.534

Now he spake of Judas Iscariot , <font> the son <$$font> of Simon :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.535

for he was about to deliver him up , <bracket> being <$$bracket> one of
the Twelve . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.536

<P_7,1J>

And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.538

for he would not walk in Judea , because the Jews sought to kill him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.539

Now the feast of the Jews , <font> called <$$font> the feast of
tabernacles , was near . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.540

His brethren therefore said unto him ; " Depart hence ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.541

and go into Judea ; that thy disciples also may see the works which thou
doest . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.542

For no man doeth any thing in secret , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.543

and <font> yet <$$font> he himself seeketh to be known publickly .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.544

If thou do these things , shew thyself to the world . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.545

<paren> For neither did his brethren believe in him . <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.546

<bracket> Then <$$bracket> Jesus saith unto them ; " My time is not yet
come : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.547

but your time is always ready . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.548

The world can@ @not hate You ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.549

but Me it hateth , because I testify of it that its works are evil .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.550

Go Ye up to this feast : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.551

I go not up <font> now <$$font> to this feast ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.552

for my time is not yet fully come . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.553

When he had said these words unto them , he <font> still <$$font>
remained in Galilee . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.554

But when his brethren had gone up , then he also went up to the feast ;
not openly , but as <font> it were <$$font> in secret .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.555

Then the Jews sought him at the feast , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.556

and said ; " Where is he ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.557

And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.558

and some said ; " He is a good man : " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.559

others said ; " No : but he deceiveth the people . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.560

However no man spake openly of him , for fear of the Jews .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.561

But <font> when it was <$$font> now about the midst of the feast , Jesus
went up into the temple , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.562

and taught . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.563

And the Jews wondered , saying ; " How hath this man learning , having
never been taught ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.564

Jesus answered them NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.565

and said ; " My doctrine is not mine , but his who sent me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.566

If any man desire to do his will , he shall know concerning the doctrine
, whether it be from God , or <font> whether <$$font> I speak of myself
. NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.567

Whoever speaketh of himself , seeketh his own glory :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.568

but whoever seeketh his glory who sent him , he is true ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.569

and unrighteousness is not in him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.570

Did not Moses give you the law ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.571

and <font> yet <$$font> none of you keepeth the law ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.572

why seek ye to kill me ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.573

<P_7,20J>

The multitude answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.575

and said ; " Thou hast a demon : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.576

who seeketh to kill thee ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.577

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.578

and said unto them ; " I have done one work ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.579

and ye all wonder at it . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.580

Moses gave you circumcision ; <paren> not that it is from Moses , but
from the fathers ; <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.581

and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.582

If a man on the sabbath receive circumcision , that the law of Moses may
not be broken ; are ye angry with me , because I made a man altogether
well on the sabbath . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.583

Judge not according to appearance ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.584

but judge righteous judgement . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.585

Then some inhabitants of Jerusalem said ; " Is not this he whom they
seek to kill ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.586

but , lo , he speaketh boldly ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.587

and nothing is said unto him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.588

Do the rulers know indeed that this is the Christ ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.589

However , we know whence this man is : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.590

but , when Christ cometh , none knoweth whence he is . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.591

Then Jesus cried out in the temple , as he taught , saying ; " Ye both
know me , and ye know whence I am : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.592

and yet I am not come of myself , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.593

but he who sent me is true , whom ye know not .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.594

<font> But <$$font> I know him : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.595

for I am from him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.596

and he hath sent me . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.597

Then the <font> Jews <$$font> sought to apprehend him :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.598

yet no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.599

But many of the multitude believed in him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.600

and said ; " When Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than
<bracket> these <$$bracket> which this <font> man <$$font> hath done .
" NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.601

The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring such things about him ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.602

and the Pharisees and the chief-priests sent officers to apprehend him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.603

Jesus therefore said ; " Yet a little time <font> longer <$$font> I
shall be with you ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.604

and <font> then <$$font> I shall go to him who sent me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.605

Ye will seek me , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.606

and will not find <font> me <$$font> ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.607

and where I shall be , <font> thither <$$font> ye can@ @not come . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.608

The Jews therefore said among themselves ; " Whither will this man go ,
that we shall not find him ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.609

will he go to the dispersed Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.610

What words are these which he said ; ' Ye will seek me , and will not
find <font> me <$$font> : and where I shall be , <font> thither <$$font>
ye can@ @not come ? ' " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.611

Now on the last day , <font> which is <$$font> the great <font> day ,
<$$font> of the feast , Jesus stood NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.612

and cried out , saying ; " If any man thirst , let him come to me , and
drink . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.613

He who believeth in me , as the scripture hath said , from his belly
shall flow rivers of living water . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.614

<paren> Now he spake this of the Spirit , which those who believe in him
were to receive : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.615

for the <bracket> Holy <$$bracket> Spirit was not yet <font> given ,
<$$font> because Jesus was not yet glorified . <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.616

<P_7,40J>

Many of the multitude therefore , when they heard these words , said ; "
In truth this is a prophet . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.618

Others said ; " This is the Christ . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.619

But others said ; " Doth the Christ come out of Galilee ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.620

Hath not the scripture said , that the Christ cometh of the offspring of
David , and from the town of Bethlehem , where David was ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.621

So there was a division among the multitude because of him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.622

And some of them desired to apprehend him : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.623

but none laid hands on him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.624

Then the officers came to the chief-priests and Pharisees who said unto
them ; " Why have ye not brought him ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.625

The officers answered , " Never man spake like this <bracket> man .
<$$bracket> " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.626

Then the Pharisees answered them ; " Are Ye also deceived ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.627

Hath any <font> one <$$font> of the rulers or of the Pharisees ,

but this multitude , who know not the law , are accursed . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.629

Nicodemus saith unto them , <paren> he that came to <font> Jesus
<$$font> by night , being one of them , <$$paren> " Doth our law judge
any man , unless it first hear him , and know what he doeth ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.630

They answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.631

and said unto him ; " Art Thou also of Galilee ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.632

Search NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.633

and see , that a prophet is not to arise from Galilee . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.634

<bracket> Then every man went to his own house :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.635

<P_8,1J>

but Jesus went to the mount of Olives . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.637

And early in the morning he came again into the temple ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.638

and all the people came to him ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.639

and he sat down NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.640

and taught them . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.641

And the scribes and the Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery
: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.642

and when they had set her in the midst , they say unto him ; " Master ,
this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.643

Now Moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.644

what then sayest Thou ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.645

Now they said this , trying him ; that they might have <font> whereof
<$$font> to accuse him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.646

But Jesus stooped down , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.647

and with <font> his <$$font> finger wrote on the ground .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.648

But when they continued asking him , he raised himself up ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.649

and said unto them ; " Let him that is without sin among you , first
cast a stone at her . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.650

And he again stooped down , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.651

and wrote on the ground . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.652

But they , having heard <font> this , <$$font> and being convicted by
<font> their <$$font> conscience , went out one by one , having begun at
the elder , to the last : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.653

and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.654

Now when Jesus raised himself up , and saw none but the woman , he said
unto her ; " Woman , where are those thine accusers ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.655

hath no man condemned thee ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.656

And she said ; " No man , Sir . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.657

And Jesus said unto her ; " Neither do I condemn thee :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.658

go , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.659

and sin no more . " <$$bracket> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.660

Then Jesus spake again unto them , saying ; " I am the light of the
world : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.661

he who followeth me , shall by no means walk in darkness ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.662

but shall have the light of life . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.663

The Pharisees therefore said unto him ; " Thou bearest witness of
thyself ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.664

thy witness is not true . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.665

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.666

and said unto them ; " Though I bear witness of myself , <font> yet
<$$font> my witness is true : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.667

for I know whence I came , and whither I go ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.668

but ye know not whence I come , and whither I go .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.669

Ye judge according to the flesh : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.670

I judge no one . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.671

And yet if I judge , my judgement is true : because I am not alone , but
I and the Father who sent me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.672

It is written in your law also , that the witness of two men is true .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.673

I bear witness of myself ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.674

and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.675

They said therefore unto him ; " Where is thy Father ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.676

Jesus answered ; " Ye neither know me , nor my Father :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.677

if ye had known me , ye would have known my Father also . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.678

<P_8,20J>

<font> Jesus <$$font> spake these words in the treasury , as he was
teaching in the temple : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.680

and yet none laid hands on him ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.681

for his hour was not yet come . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.682

Then Jesus said unto them again ; " I <font> shall <$$font> depart ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.683

and ye will seek me , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.684

and will die in your sin : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.685

whither I depart , ye can@ @not come . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.686

Then the Jews said ; " Will he kill himself ? because he saith , '
Whither I depart , ye can@ @not come . ' " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.687

And he said unto them ; " Ye are of those beneath ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.688

I am of those above : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.689

ye are of this world ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.690

I am not of this world . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.691

I therefore said unto you , that ye will die in your sins :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.692

for if ye believe not that I am <font> he , <$$font> ye will die in your
sins . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.693

Then they said unto him ; " Who art thou ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.694

<bracket> And <$$bracket> Jesus said unto them ; " Even what I told you
at first . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.695

I have many things to say concerning you , and to condemn :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.696

but he who sent me , is true ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.697

and I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.698

They understood not that he spake to them of the Father .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.699

Then Jesus said unto them ; " When ye have lifted up the Son of man ,
then ye will know that I am <font> he , <$$font> and <font> that
<$$font> I do nothing of myself ; but speak these things as my Father
hath taught me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.700

And he who sent me is with me : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.701

the Father hath not left me alone ; because I always do those things
which please him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.702

As he spake these words , many believed in him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.703

Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him ; " If ye continue in
my word , <font> then , <$$font> ye are truly my disciples :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.704

and ye shall know the truth , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.705

and the truth shall make you free . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.706

<font> Some <$$font> answered him ; " We are Abraham's offspring ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.707

and were never slaves to any man : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.708

how sayest thou , ' Ye shall become free ? ' "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.709

Jesus answered them ; " Verily verily I say unto you , Whosoever
committeth sin , is the slave of sin . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.710

And the slave abideth not in the house for ever :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.711

<font> but <$$font> the son abideth for ever .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.712

If the Son therefore shall make you free , ye will be free indeed .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.713

I know that ye are Abraham's offspring : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.714

yet ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.715

I speak that which I have seen with <bracket> my <$$bracket> Father :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.716

and ye do that which ye have seen with <bracket> your <$$bracket> father
. " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.717

They answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.718

and said unto him ; " Abraham is our father . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.719

Jesus saith unto them ; " If ye were Abraham's children , ye would do
the works of Abraham . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.720

<P_8,40J>

But now ye seek to kill me , a man that have spoken to you the truth ,
which I have heard from God : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.722

Abraham did not act thus . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.723

Ye do the works of your father . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.724

Then they said to him . " We are not born of fornication :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.725

we have one Father , <font> even <$$font> God . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.726

Jesus said unto them ; " If God were your Father , ye would love me :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.727

for I came forth from God , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.728

and come <font> unto you ; <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.729

for I came not of myself , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.730

Why do ye not understand my discourse ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.732

because ye can@ @not hearken to my words . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.733

Ye are of <font> your <$$font> father the devil ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.734

and the desires of your father ye are disposed to do .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.735

He was a slayer of men from the beginning , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.736

and continued not in the truth ; because there is no truth in him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.737

When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.738

for he is a liar , and the father of liars .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.739

And because I speak the truth , ye believe me not .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.740

Which of you convicteth me of sin ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.741

If I speak the truth , why do ye not believe me ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.742

He that is of God , hearkeneth to God's words :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.743

ye therefore hearken not , because ye are not of God . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.744

The Jews answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.745

and said unto him ; " Say we not well , that thou art a Samaritan , and
hast a demon ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.746

Jesus answered ; " I have not a demon : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.747

but I honour my Father , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.748

and ye dishonour me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.749

But I seek not mine own glory : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.750

there is one who seeketh <font> it , <$$font> and judgeth ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.751

Verily verily I say unto you ; If a man keep my words , he shall never

The Jews therefore said unto him ; " Now we know that thou hast a demon

Abraham is dead , and the prophets <font> also : <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.754

yet thou sayest ; ' If a man keep my words , he shall never taste of
death . ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.755

Art thou greater than our father Abraham , that is dead ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.756

and the prophets are dead <font> also : <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.757

whom makest thou thyself ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.758

Jesus answered ; " If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.759

it is my Father who glorifieth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your God
: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.760

and yet ye know him not ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.761

but I know him : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.762

and if I should say , ' I know him not , ' I should speak falsely , like
you : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.763

but I know him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.764

and keep his words . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.765

Your father Abraham earnestly desired that he might see my day :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.766

and he saw <font> it , <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.767

and was glad , " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.768

The Jews therefore said unto him ; " Thou art not yet fifty years old ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.769

and hast thou seen Abraham ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.770

Jesus said unto them ; " Verily verily I say unto you , Before Abraham
was born , I am . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.771

Then they took up stones to cast at him : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.772

but Jesus concealed himself , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.773

and went out of the temple . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.774

<P_9,1J>

And as he passed by , he saw a man <font> that had been <$$font> blind
from <font> his <$$font> birth . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.776

And his disciples asked him , saying ; " Master , who sinned , this man
, or his parents , that he was born blind ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.777

Jesus answered ; " Neither did this man sin , nor his parents : but that
the works of God might be manifested in him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.778

I must work the works of him who sent me , while it is day :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.779

the night cometh , when no man can work . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.780

While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.781

When he had said this , he spat on the ground ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.782

and made clay of the spittle , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.783

and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.784

and said unto him ; " Go , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.785

wash thyself in the pool of Siloam : " <paren> which is , by
interpretation , Sent . <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.786

He departed therefore , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.787

and washed himself , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.788

and came seeing . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.789

The neighbours therefore , and those who had seen him before , <paren>
for he had been a beggar , <$$paren> said ; " Is not this he who sat and
begged ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.790

Some said ; " This is he . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.791

And others <font> said ; <$$font> " He is like him . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.792

<font> But <$$font> He said ; " I am <font> he <$$font> . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.793

They said therefore unto him ; " How were thine eyes opened ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.794

He answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.795

and said ; " A man , called Jesus , made clay ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.796

and anointed mine eyes , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.797

and said unto me ; ' Go to Siloam , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.798

and wash thyself : ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.799

and I went NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.800

and washed myself , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.801

and received my sight . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.802

Then they said unto him ; " Where is he ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.803

He saith ; " I know not . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.804

<font> Then <$$font> they bring him to the Pharisees ; him , <font> I
say , <$$font> who before was blind . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.805

Now it was the sabbath , when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes
. NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.806

Then the Pharisees also asked him again , how he had received his sight
. NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.807

And he said unto them ; " He put clay on mine eyes ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.808

and I washed myself , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.809

and see . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.810

Wherefore some of the Pharisees said ; " This man is not from God ,
because he keepeth not the sabbath . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.811

Others said ; " How can a sinner do such miracles ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.812

And there was a division among them . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.813

They say again to the blind man ; " What sayest Thou of him , since he
hath opened thine eyes ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.814

And <font> the blind man <$$font> said ; " He is a prophet . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.815

Upon this the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been
blind , and had received his sight , until they called his parents :
<font> the parents , I say , <$$font> of him that had received his sight
. NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.816

And they asked them , saying ; " Is this your son , of whom ye say that
he was born blind ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.817

how then doth he now see ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.818

<P_9,20J>

His parents answered them , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.820

and said ; " We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.821

but by what means he now seeth , we know not ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.822

or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.823

he is of age ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.824

ask Him : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.825

he will speak for himself . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.826

His parents spake these words , because they feared the Jews :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.827

for the Jews had already agreed that , if any man should confess <font>
Jesus <$$font> to be <font> the <$$font> Christ , he should be put out
of the synagogue . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.828

For this cause his parents said ; " He is of age ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.829

ask him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.830

A second time therefore they called the man that had been blind ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.831

and said unto him ; " Give glory to God : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.832

we know that this man is a sinner . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.833

<bracket> Then <$$bracket> he answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.834

and said ; " Whether he be a sinner , I know not :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.835

one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , I now see . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.836

Then they said to him again ; " What did he to thee ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.837

how opened he thine eyes ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.838

He answered them ; " I have told you already ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.839

and ye did not hearken : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.840

why desire ye to hear <font> it <$$font> again ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.841

would Ye also be his disciples ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.842

<font> Then <$$font> they reviled him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.843

and said ; " Thou art his disciple ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.844

but We are disciples of Moses . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.845

We know that God spake to Moses : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.846

but we know not whence this man is . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.847

The man answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.848

and said unto them ; " In this now is a wonderful thing , that ye know
not whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.849

Now we know that God heareth not sinners : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.850

but if any man be a worshipper of God , and do his will , him he heareth
. NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.851

From the beginning of the world , it hath not been heard that any man
opened the eyes of one born blind . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.852

If this man were not from God , he could do nothing . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.853

They answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.854

and said unto him ; " Thou wast altogether born in sins ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.855

and dost Thou teach Us ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.856

And they cast him out <font> of their synagogues . <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.857

Jesus heard that they had cast him out : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.858

and , when he met him , he said unto him ; " Dost thou believe in the
Son of God ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.859

He answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.860

and said ; " Who is he , Sir , that I may believe in him ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.861

And Jesus said unto him ; " Thou hast both seen him ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.862

and it is he who talketh with thee . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.863

And <font> the man <$$font> said ; " Sir , I believe . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.864

And he did <font> Jesus <$$font> obeisance .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.865

Then Jesus said ; " For judgement I am come into this world : that those
who see not , may see ; and that those who see , may become blind . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.866

<P_9,40J>

And <font> some <$$font> of the Pharisees that were with him , heard
these words , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,40J.868

and said unto him ; " Are We also blind ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,40J.869

Jesus said unto them ; " If ye were blind , ye would not have sin :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,40J.870

but now ye say , ' We see : ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,40J.871

your sin therefore remaineth . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,40J.872

<P_10,1J>

Verily verily I say unto you , he that entereth not by the door into the
sheep-fold , but climbeth up some other way , that man is a thief and a
robber . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.874

But he that entereth in by the door , is the shepherd of the sheep .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.875

To him the porter openeth ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.876

and the sheep hearken to his voice : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.877

and he calleth his own sheep by name , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.878

and leadeth them out . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.879

And when he bringeth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.880

and the sheep follow him ; for they know his voice . Whereas a stranger
they will not follow , but will flee from him :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.881

for they know not the voice of strangers . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.882

This parable Jesus spake unto them : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.883

but they understood not what things they were , which he spake unto them
. NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.884

Jesus therefore said unto them again ; " Verily verily I say unto you ,
I am the door of the sheep . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.885

All that have come <bracket> before me <$$bracket> are thieves and
robbers : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.886

but the sheep did not hear them . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.887

I am the door : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.888

by me if any enter in , he shall be safe , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.889

and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.890

The thief cometh not , but to steal , and to kill , and to destroy :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.891

I am come that <font> the Sheep <$$font> may have life , and that they
may have it abundantly . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.892

I am the good shepherd : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.893

the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.894

But he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep
are not , seeth the wolf coming , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.895

and leaveth the sheep , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.896

and fleeth ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.897

and the wolf seizeth them , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.898

and scattereth the sheep : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.899

and the hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for
the sheep . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.900

I am the good shepherd , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.901

and know my <font> sheep , <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.902

and am known by mine ; <font> even <$$font> as the Father knoweth me ,
and <font> as <$$font> I know the Father : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.903

and I lay down my life for the sheep . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.904

And other sheep I have , which are not of this fold :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.905

them also I must bring , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.906

and they will hear my voice ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.907

and there shall be one flock , <font> and <$$font> one shepherd .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.908

For this my Father loveth me ; because I lay down my life , that I may
take it again . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.909

None taketh it from me ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.910

but I lay it down of myself . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.911

I have power to lay it down , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.912

and I have power to take it again . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.913

This commission I have received from my Father . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.914

There was a division therefore again among the Jews because of these
words . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.915

<P_10,20J>

And many of them said ; " He hath a demon ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.917

and is mad ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.918

why hear ye him ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.919

Others said ; " These are not the words of him that hath a demon .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.920

Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.921

Now the feast of Dedication was kept at Jerusalem ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.922

and it was winter . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.923

And Jesus walked in the temple , in Solomon's porch .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.924

Then the Jews surrounded him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.925

and said unto him ; " How long dost thou keep us in suspence ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.926

If thou be the Christ , tell us plainly . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.927

Jesus answered them ; " I have told you , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.928

and ye believe not : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.929

the works which I do in my Father's name , they bear witness of me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.930

But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.931

As I said unto you , my sheep hear my voice ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.932

and I know them , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.933

and they follow me : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.934

and I give unto them everlasting life ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.935

and they shall never perish , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.936

nor shall any one snatch them out of mine hand .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.937

My Father , that hath given <font> them <$$font> to me , is greater than
all ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.938

and none is able to snatch <font> them <$$font> out of my Father's hand
. NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.939

I and the Father are one . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.940

Then the Jews took up stones again , to stone him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.941

Jesus said to them ; " Many good works I have shewn you from my Father :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.942

for which of those works do ye stone me ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.943

The Jews answered him , <bracket> saying ; <$$bracket> For a good work
we stone thee not ; but for blasphemy , and because thou , being a man ,
makest thyself God . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.944

Jesus answered them ; " Is it not written in your law , ' I said , Ye
are gods ? ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.945

If those be called gods , to whom the word of God came , <paren> and the
scripture can@ @not be made void ; <$$paren> say ye of him , whom the
Father hath set apart , and sent into the world , ' Thou blasphemest : '
because I said , ' I am <font> the <$$font> Son of God ? '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.946

If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.947

but if I do <font> them , <$$font> though ye believe not Me , believe
the works : that ye may know and believe that the Father <font> is
<$$font> in me , and I in him ; " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.948

Upon this they sought again to apprehend him :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.949

but he escaped out of their hand ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.950

<P_10,40J>

and departed again beyond Jordan , to the place where John at first
baptized : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.952

and there he abode . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.953

And many resorted to him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.954

and said ; " John did no miracle : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.955

but all things which John spake of this man were true . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.956

And many believed in him there . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.957

<P_11,1J>

Now a certain man was sick , <font> named <$$font> Lazarus , of Bethany
, the town of Mary and of her sister Martha .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.959

<paren> Now it was <font> the same <$$font> Mary that anointed the Lord
with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus
was sick . <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.960

His sisters therefore sent to <font> Jesus , <$$font> saying ; " Master
, behold , he whom thou lovest is sick . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.961

And when Jesus heard <font> it , <$$font> he said ; " This sickness is
not unto death ; but for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be
glorified by it . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.962

<paren> Now Jesus loved Martha , and her siser , and Lazarus .
<$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.963

When he heard therefore that <font> Lazarus <$$font> was sick , he still
abode two days in the place where he was . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.964

Then afterward he saith to <font> his <$$font> disciples ; " Let us go
again into Judea . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.965

<font> His <$$font> disciples say unto him ; " Master , <font> but
<$$font> now the Jews sought to stone thee :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.966

and goest thou thither again ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.967

Jesus answered ; " Are there not twelve hours of the day ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.968

If a man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light
of this world : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.969

but if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth ; because the light is not
in him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.970

He spake these things ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.971

and afterward he saith unto them ; " Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.972

but I go that I may awake him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.973

Then his disciples said ; " Master , if he sleep , he will recover . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.974

But Jesus spake of his death : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.975

yet they thought that he was speaking of rest in sleep .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.976

Then Jesus said to them plainly ; " Lazarus is dead .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.977

And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , that ye may believe
: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.978

but let us go to him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.979

Then Thomas , who is called Didymus , said to his fellow-disciples : "
Let Us also go , that we may die with him . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.980

When Jesus therefore came , he found that <font> Lazarus <$$font> had
already lain four days in the sepulchre . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.981

<paren> Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.982

and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , that they might comfort
them concerning their brother . <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.983

<P_11,20J>

Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , <font> went
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.985

and <$$font> met him : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.986

but Mary sat in the house . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.987

Then said Martha to Jesus ; " Master , if thou hadst been here , my
brother had not died . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.988

But I know that , even now , whatsoever thou shalt ask of God , God will
give thee . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.989

Jesus saith unto her ; " Thy brother shall rise again . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.990

Martha saith unto him ; " I know that he will rise again in the
resurrection at the last day . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.991

Jesus said unto her ; " I am the resurrection , and the life :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.992

he who believeth in me , though he die , yet he shall live :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.993

and whosoever liveth , and believeth in me , shall never die .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.994

Believest thou this ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.995

She saith unto him ; " Yes , Master , I believe that thou art the Christ
, the Son of God , who was to come into the world . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.996

And when she had said this , she went NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.997

and called her sister Mary secretly , saying ; " The Master is come and
calleth for thee . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.998

As soon as <font> Mary <$$font> heard <font> this , <$$font> she riseth
quickly , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.999

and cometh to him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1000

<paren> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1001

but was in the place where Martha met him . <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1002

The Jews then , who were with Mary in the house , and were comforting
her , when they saw that she rose up hastily , and went out , followed
her , saying ; " She goeth to the sepulchre , that she may weep there .
" NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1003

As soon then as Mary came where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down
at his feet , saying unto him ; " Master , if thou hadst been here , my
brother had not died . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1004

When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews <font> also <$$font>
weeping who came with her , he groaned in spirit ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1005

and was troubled , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1006

and said ; " Where have ye laid him ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1007

They say unto him ; " Master , come and see . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1008

Jesus wept . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1009

The Jews therefore said ; " See , how he loved him . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1010

But some of them said ; " Could not He , that opened the eyes of the
blind man , have caused even that this <font> Lazarus <$$font> should
not have died . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1011

Jesus therefore , again groaning in himself , cometh to the sepulchre .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1012

Now it was a cave , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1013

and a stone lay against it . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1014

Jesus saith ; " Take away the stone . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1015

Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him ; " Master ,
by this time he stinketh : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1016

for he hath been <font> buried <$$font> four days . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1017

<P_11,40J>

Jesus saith unto her ; " Said I not unto thee that , if thou wouldest
believe , thou shouldest see the glory of God ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1019

Then they took away the stone . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1020

And Jesus lifted up <font> his <$$font> eyes ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1021

and said , " Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1022

I know indeed that thou hearest me always :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1023

but because of the multitude who stand by I have said <font> this ,
<$$font> that they may believe that thou hast sent me . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1024

And when he had said these words , he cried out with a loud voice ; "
Lazarus , come forth . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1025

<bracket> And <$$bracket> he that had been , dead came out , having his
hands and feet bound with grave-clothes : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1026

and his face was bound about with a napkin .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1027

Jesus saith unto them ; " Loose him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1028

and let him go . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1029

Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary , and had seen the things
which Jesus did , believed in him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1030

But some of them went away to the Pharisees ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1031

and told them what things Jesus had done .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1032

The chief-priests therefore and the Pharisees assembled a council ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1033

and said ; " What shall we do ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1034

for this man doeth many miracles . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1035

If we suffer him <font> to go on <$$font> thus , all <font> men <$$font>
will believe in him : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1036

and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1037

Then one of them , <font> named <$$font> Caiaphas , being high-priest
that year , said unto them ; " Ye know nothing ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1038

nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the
people , and that the whole nation should not perish . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1039

Now he spake not this of himself : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1040

but , being high-priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus was to die
for that nation : and <font> indeed <$$font> not for that nation only ;
but that he should gather together also in one the children of God , who
were scattered abroad . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1041

From that day therefore they took counsel together to kill him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1042

Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1043

but went thence to a country near the desert , to a city called Ephraim
; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1044

and continued there with his disciples . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1045

And the passover of the Jews was near : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1046

and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover ,
to purify themselves . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1047

Then they sought for Jesus , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1048

and said among themselves , as they stood in the temple , " What think
ye ? that he will not come to the feast ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1049

Now both the chief-priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment ,
that , if any man knew where he was , he should discover <font> it
<$$font> ; that they might apprehend him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1050
