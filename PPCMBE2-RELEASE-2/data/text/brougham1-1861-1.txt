Pinchbeck . The Doctor not down yet . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.10

Now for my studies . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.11

A medical practitioner I am resolved to be , somehow or other ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.12

it only wants a tolerable share of impudence , and a few of the regular
phrases ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.13

<font> half <$$font> the capital I know that I possess already -
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.14

the other half I@ @'m picking up daily . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.15

Ah , here are a couple of stray prescriptions to add to my stock .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.16

<paren> <font> picks up prescriptions , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.17

and puts them in pocket-book <$$font> <$$paren> BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.18

I wonder how my other profession gets on . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.19

Let@ @'s see if there@ @'s any chance of a nibble this morning .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.20

Hallo ! my advertisement not in ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.21

- yes , here it is . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.22

<paren> <font> reads <$$font> <$$paren> " Matrimonial .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.23

- A professional gentleman , of good social position , knowing how many
people are deterred by an unconquerable timidity from avowing their
preferences , and , instigated by a spirit of humanity , has established
a secret agency , through which the happy union of congenial
temperaments can be effected in the most confidential manner .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.24

- Apply , &c. " BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.25

My correspondence has not been voluminous as yet .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.26

Ah , here@ @'s another bite from a cautious kind of fish , who has been
nibbling at the hook recently , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.27

<paren> <font> reads <$$font> <$$paren> " Romeo will be at W.'s office ,
to-morrow , at twelve . " BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.28

Hurrah ! this looks like a capture , I think ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.29

the Doctor always makes his calls at that time , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.30

and the coast will be clear for my operations . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.31

Meanwhile , I must read up for my medical character .

how very singular , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.37

I feel these symptoms every day , just about this time -
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,3.38

" remedy : <P_4> a strong dilution " - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.39

nothing like prevention ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.40

I shall prescribe for myself , at once - strong dilution ;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.41

I do@ @n't know anything stronger than brandy . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.42

Pinch. Fortunately , no - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.51

most essential ingredient in the professional mixture ;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.52

but how do we find ourselves this morning - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.53

is our pulse regular , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.54

have we had a quiet night ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.55

what a capital doctor you would make . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.72

Pinch. I believe you - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.73

I@ @'ve watched them closely , dear - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.74

good deal of humbug among the medicals ! BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.75

Most ailments you see are imaginary - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.76

we have to humour <font> those <$$font> patients , study their
characters , not their complaints - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.77

that@ @'s the principle - tickle them up with cordials , alcoholic
balsams , and palatable medicated confections . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.78

Perk. But if they should be really ill ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.79

Pinch. Then we have nothing to do but consult , and shift the
responsibility . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.80

Perk. Why , I declare you seem to be quite fit to go into the doctory
line yourself . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.81

Pinch. I should think so , indeed . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.82

You do@ @n't suppose that I have swept a doctor's office , and dusted
his clothes and books a whole year for nothing . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.83

Now , I have something else to say to you - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,4.84

I@ @'ve got a wonderful nibble at <P_5> my matrimonial book .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.85

You promised to assist me and go halves in the plunder ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.86

so you@ @'ll have to represent the eligible party to all the male
gudgeons . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.87

I can manage the feminine department myself . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.88

Perk. I@ @'ll do just what you say , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.89

for I do believe you are clever enough to make both our fortunes .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.90

Pinch. That@ @'s right ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.91

Perkins <font> runs off . <$$font> BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.97

Pinch. Singular and sudden attack , sir - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.98

sort of what-you-call-em dance - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.99

beg your pardon for taking the liberty , sir - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.100

I was just looking at the book to see what it meant .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.101

Dr. S. I think I might see a walking volume of rascality without
straining my eye-sight much , Master Pinchbeck ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.102

but you@ @'re a useful scamp enough , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.103

and so , until you make it too apparent , I suppose I must continue
partially blind . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.104

Pinch. Always glad of your good opinion , sir . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.105

Dr. S. That will do - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.106

Dr. S. My dear boy , of course , you are privileged always ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.125

but you must confess , that when a man who loves to devour his daily ,

Herb. Yes - I know - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,5.127

Herb. Touch ! BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.140

Dr. S. Indigestion . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.142

Herb. Pshaw - feel my pulse . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.143

Dr. S. - Regular as clock-work . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.144

Herb. Indeed - anatomical mockery - sanguineous deception .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.145

Look in my eye . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.146

Dr. S. I do - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.147

Herb. No , no - I almost wish it were . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.165

Dr. S. The deuce , you do . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.166

Pray , explain yourself . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.167

Dr. S. And you have seen some one - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.180

Herb. Stop ! BROUGHAM1-1861-1,6.181

I wo@ @n't allow your tongue to utter such <P_7> a sacrilegious thought

Dr. S. Oh , then , perhaps she - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.185

Herb. No ; I tell you - no - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.186

Herb. On the contrary , fresh and fair and beautiful as Hebe .

Dr. S. In any extremity . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.200

Herb. Then listen to me , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.201

and let me have your advice . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.202

My wife is the victim of some concealed sorrow , the cause of which I
ca@ @n't divine . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.203

Since our marriage we have lived only for each other , as you know ;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.204

the years flew by in calm tranquillity , happy in our mutual confidence
, happy in our entwined affection . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.205

Dr. S. But surely - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.206

Herb. Wait ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.207

not long since , only a few months ago , it smote upon my heart like a
sudden stab that there was a something , I knew not what , wanting in
our perfect understanding of each other . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.208

I could accuse myself of no concealment except of that one shadow of
surmise ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.209

hour by hour , however , my suspicions grew to certainty ;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.210

I could perceive that her gaiety was unreal , assumed , constrained ,
put on while we were together , only to be abandoned when she was alone
. BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.211

Well , one day I had just quitted her , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.212

and urged almost to desperation by the cruel doubts that oppressed me ,
I - I listened at her door , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.213

I - I looked through her keyhole , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.214

I did , William , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.215

I did ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.216

the hot blood sears my cheek for it , now , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.217

but I <font> was <$$font> that abject , cowardly thing , that miserably
mean eavesdropper . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.218

Once , only <font> once <$$font> , upon my honour -
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.219

honour ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.220

- <font> my <$$font> honour ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.221

Well , I was punished for it , amply , deservedly , when I saw the lie
pass from her brow , and the truth , the terrible truth reveal itself ;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.222

she <font> had <$$font> deceived me , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.223

the echo of the merry laugh with which she parted from me had scarcely
<P_8> died away , before I saw her gaze with a sad , painful expression
upon the door I had passed through , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.224

and she wept - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.225

wept , I tell you , man , a flood of silent , agonizing tears ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.226

and I , who but a few moments before would have faced her lightest
sorrow , at the peril of my life , my soul , felt a curse spring upward
from my heart ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.227

but my great love compelled it back , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.228

and changed it to a grief . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.229

Oh , William , I could cry now like a child , like a child .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.230

Dr. S. And from as small a cause , no doubt . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.231

Herb. You can@ @not question the sincerity of my suffering ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.232

or do <font> you <$$font> wish to deceive me also with a feigned
indifference ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.233

in either case I - <paren> <font> rising <$$font> <$$paren>
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.234

Dr. S. Stop ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.235

do@ @n't be hasty ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.236

I@ @'m afraid you have been so already , conjuring up a spectre which
may seem very hideous , and be nothing but vapour after all ;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.237

let us look the phantom boldly in the face : BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.238

how long is it since you made this grim discovery ?
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.239

Herb. Three months and five days . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.240

Dr. S. There@ @'s nothing like being particular in dates ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.241

I presume you have@ @n't hinted to your wife - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.242

Herb. Of course not ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.243

do you think me insane ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.244

Dr. S. Not yet ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.245

nor given any indication by change of feature , or coolness of manner ,
that might suggest a suspicion to her . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.246

Herb. No , at least , not designedly . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.247

Dr. S. But by accident ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.248

they breathe hard who wear masks always . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.249

Herb. I ca@ @n't tell , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.250

I believe not . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.251

Dr. S. At all events , she still plays the same part ?
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.252

Herb. Yes , <font> plays <$$font> it , oh , how skilfully !
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.253

Dr. S. You ca@ @n't think of any reason springing from yourself - any
slight jealousy or misconception ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.254

Herb. None whatever . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.255

Dr. S. It@ @'s reasonable to conclude then , that the cause , whatever
it be , must rest with her alone ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.256

What@ @'s the use of all the enjoyment the world can procure if you have
to lock it up in your own chest ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,15.532

It wo@ @n't keep sweet unless it can get air , unless you can give it to
somebody to take care of it for you , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,15.533

and even then you must take it out occasionally , like very good clothes
, for fear the moth should get into it ; toss it to and fro , from one
to the other - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,15.534

I do@ @n't mean ridiculously , like overgrown children with a toy that
might be lost or broken in the operation , but like a delicate gem whose
lustre should only be renewed by your own hands .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,15.535

Why you@ @'ll forget you ever possessed it if you stowed it away in a
drawer . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,15.536

Herbert , will you answer me one question ingenuously ?
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,15.537

Herb. Yes , uncle , if I can . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,15.538

Uncle T. Do you think - now promise me that you wo@ @n't laugh - do you

Herb. Certainly not , sir , if - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,15.541

Uncle T. Yes , yes , I know , if I could find anybody to marry me .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,15.542

Herb. I was about to say , if your inclination led you in that
direction . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,15.543

Uncle T. {TEXT:missing_"T."} It is@ @n't likely I would , you know ,
unless it did . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,15.544

<P_16>

Herb. May I ask you in return , sir , have you any such inclination ?
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.546

Uncle T. {TEXT:missing_"T."} Well , yes - no - I mean it depends a good
deal on circumstances . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.547

Herb. What circumstances ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.548

Uncle T. {TEXT:missing_"T."} Never you mind , sir !
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.549

Herb. The astonishment to me is , that you never thought of it before .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.550

Uncle T. {TEXT:missing_"T."} How do you know I never thought of it ?
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.551

I <font> have <$$font> , my boy , dozens of times .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.552

Whenever I saw a truly happy couple , I was instantly inoculated with
the infection , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.553

and looked about me eagerly to find a desirable partner ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.554

but before I could call up courage enough to ask the definite question ,
some accidental scene of domestic disquiet would be sure to send me back
into my shell like a frightened snail . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.555

Herb. This visit of yours is somewhat unexpected , uncle .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.556

Uncle T. {TEXT:missing_"T."} Yes , my boy , I@ @'ll tell you how it
happened - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.557

Sister Patience and I were invited to a wedding about a month ago ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.558

and the delight of the young people made me feel so like a malefactor
that I resolved to put a speedy end to my bachelor days .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.559

Now , our village is not an extensive place for matrimonial operations ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.560

and Patience is as watchful as a lynx , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.561

so I had to try a desperate manoeuvre , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.562

and - well , you@ @'ll see what , by-and-bye . <paren> <font> about to
take a letter out <$$font> <$$paren> BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.563

Herb. Is Aunt Patience with you ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.564

Uncle T. {TEXT:missing_"T."} <paren> <font> looking round <$$font>
<$$paren> Bless me , no ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.565

since she lost her husband , old Crabsticke , and came to live with me ,
I have received the full benefit of her domestic experience .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.566

She used to worry the poor old fellow to the verge of lunacy ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.567

and now ca@ @n't get rid of the old habit , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.568

and certainly does contrive to keep me in a blessed state of tribulation
. BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.569

Think of that , my boy - to have all the aggravating irritabilities of a
duplicated existence without any of its little comforts ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.570

is@ @n't it too bad . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.571

Why , what@ @'s the matter with you , Herbert , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.572

Herb. With me ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.574

never felt better in all my life . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.576

Uncle T. {TEXT:missing_"T."} Anything amiss between you and Julia ?
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.577

<P_17>

Herb. Certainly not , sir . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,17.579

How could you imagine such a thing ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,17.580

Uncle T. {TEXT:missing_"T."} . I do@ @n't know -
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,17.581

partly on my own account ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,17.582

Give me the extremes of joy and grief instead : and I wo@ @n't allow you
to mock your kindly disposition so far as to speak harshly of a state

BROUGHAM1-1861-1,18.627

Uncle T. I think I could contrive to do without the surplus .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,18.628

Herb. But , sir , imagine the ample store of pleasures lost by those
who journey through the world in single selfishness .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,18.629

Uncle T. A man ca@ @n't miss what he never had .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,18.630

Herb. But men generally envy what they ca@ @n't obtain ;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,18.631

BROUGHAM1-1861-1,18.632

Uncle T. Nobody if he had a right to it , and was assured of its
reality . Herb. Which can only be determined by the test .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,18.633

Uncle T. And then if it should turn out counterfeit , it would be too
late for anything but the pleasant consciousness of having cheated
yourself - doomed , moreover to have the consequence of your rashness
tied about your neck - a heap of spurious coin that you can neither
change nor fling away . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,18.634

What ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,20.721

I@ @'ll tell you what in a few words . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,20.722

I noticed latterly that he had established a correspondence with some

BROUGHAM1-1861-1,20.730

" If I can get away , for I am watched by a remorseless old catamaran ,
" - that@ @'s what he calls his own sister - " you shall know of it by
looking at to-morrow's paper , BROUGHAM1-1861-1,20.731

Mrs. C. What on earth do you mean , sir ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,21.780

Pinch. Hush ! keep my secret , and I shall crown your <P_22>

the entrance fee to place your name on my books .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,22.781

Mrs. C. What books ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,22.782

Pinch. My repertory of marriageable parties . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,22.783

I know the delicate nature of your mission , my dear madam

Mrs. C. Are you mad , sir ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,22.786

Pinch. Suffice it to say , madam , in me you behold the veritable
Doctor Savage , Medical Practitioner , Matrimonial Agent , Leader of
Blind Cupids , and Door Keeper to the Temple of Hymen .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,22.788

Mrs. C. Are you Dr. Savage ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,22.789

Pinch. One of them . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,22.790

You@ @'ll give me till to-morrow , to arrange preliminaries .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,23.817

Mrs. C. What preliminaries ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,23.818

Is there any more to be done than to let us meet anywhere out of this -
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,23.819

there@ @'s no ceremony requisite ? BROUGHAM1-1861-1,23.820

Pinch. No ceremony - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,23.821

not immediately , I grant ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,23.822

but , pray , recollect I can promise no more than to bring about an

Now , if the other party - you@ @'ll excuse the insinuation - should be

Mrs. S. Oh , my dear , so am I . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.850

Mrs. H. Is it possible ! BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.851

Mrs. S. How could it be otherwise ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.852

just imagine the life I lead ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.853

your husband has always a kind word and sweet smile on his lips ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.854

but my brute hardly ever condescends to honour me with a grunt .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.855

Mrs. H. But he loves you , Fanny . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.856

Mrs. S. Well , I suppose he does , in his bearish way
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.857

but I@ @'m sure your husband doats upon you . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.858

Mrs. H. What makes you so sure of that , Fanny ?
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.859

Mrs. S. Because everybody can see he does . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.860

Mrs. H. Everybody except me . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.861

Mrs. S. I@ @'m afraid , my dear , that you are rather too exacting .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.862

Ah , you should have my savage to deal with . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.863

Mrs. H. He is in earnest , Fanny - honest and sincere -
notwithstanding his roughness ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.864

but the respect and affection which you and everybody see exhibited
towards me are nothing but pretence and mockery .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.865

Mrs. S. You surprise me indeed ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.866

why I looked upon you as perfect models of domestic felicity !
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.867

Mrs. H. That something or somebody had estranged him from me .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.872

Mrs. S. Ah ! I see ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.873

Mrs. H. Oh , no , no , it is@ @n't that ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.875

Mrs. H. I know not . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,24.878

this uncertainty is more <P_25> than I can bear ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.889

and to persist in such a life of mutual deception would be unworthy and
humiliating . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.890

Mrs. S. I do@ @n't know really how to counsel you ;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.891

I never met with a case like yours , seeming to love each other so

Mrs. S. Oh , that@ @'s a different thing ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.896

Mrs. H. Ah ! if I could arrive at such indifference ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.900

but it is Herbert alone who is blest with so apathetic a temperament .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.901

Mrs. S. I do@ @n't believe it . BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.902

The fact is , my dear , you have@ @n't managed him properly ,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.903

depend upon it ; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.904

these men are strange , cross-grained institutions .
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.905

If one of the born tyrants is perfectly certain that a conquered heart
