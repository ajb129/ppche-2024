Notes upon the Book of John . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.4

Chap. I . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.5

<$$heading>

The Word was in the Beginning , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.7

and it was with God , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.8

nay the Word was God . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.9

He himself was with God in the Beginning . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.10

All Things were made by him , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.11

and without him there was not one Thing made which was made .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.12

In him there was Life , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.13

and that was the Light of Men . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.14

And the Light shined in Darkness , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.15

but the Darkness did not perceive it . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.16

There was a Man sent from God , whose Name was John .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.17

He himself came for a Witness , that he might testify concerning the
Light , for all to believe by it . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.18

He was not that Light , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.19

but was to testify concerning the Light ; Which was the true Light ,
that enlightens every Person who comes into the World .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.20

He was in the World , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.21

and it was made by him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.22

yet that did not know him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.23

He came to his own , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.24

and they did not receive him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.25

But to them whoever received him , he gave Authority to become the
Children of God , to those that believed in his Name : Who were born ,
not of Blood , nor of the Will of the Flesh , nor of the Will of Man ,
but of God . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.26

And the Word became Flesh , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.27

and dwelt among us <paren> so that we saw his Glory , the Glory as of
the only begotten one of the Father <$$paren> full of Grace and Truth .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.28

John testified concerning him , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.29

and cried out , as follows ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.30

This was he of whom I spoke , One who comes after me is before me ,
because he was prior to me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.31

And of his Fulness we have all received , even Grace for Grace .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.32

Since the Law was given by Moses , Grace and Truth was by Jesus Christ .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.33

None has ever seen God ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.34

that only begotten Son , who is in the Bosom of the Father , has
declared <font> him <$$font> . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.35

And this was the Testimony of John , when the Jews sent Priests and
Levites out of Jerusalem , for them to ask him , Who art thou ?
<P_1,20J> Whereupon he confessed , and did not deny , even confessed , I
am not Christ . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.36

And they asked him , What then ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.37

Art thou Elias ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.38

To which he says , I am not . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.39

Art thou the Prophet ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.40

And he answered , No . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.41

Therefore they enquired of him , Who art thou ? that we may give an
Answer to them that sent us : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.42

what dost speak concerning thy self ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.43

He replied : I am the Voice of one crying out in the Wilderness , Let
the Way for the Lord be straight ; as the Prophet Esaias said .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.44

Moreover those who were sent were some of the Pharisees .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.45

Next they asked him in this manner , Why then dost thou baptize , if
thou art not Christ , nor Elias , nor the Prophet ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.46

John made answer to them ; I baptize with Water ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.47

but there stands one amongst you , whom ye do not know .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.48

It is he that comes after me , who is before me ; the Latchet of whose
Shoe I am not worthy that I should undo . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.49

These Things were done at Bethabara beyond Jordan , where John was
baptizing . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.50

The next Day John beholds Jesus coming to him ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.51

and says ; Lo the Lamb of God , that takes away the Sin of the World .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.52

This is he concerning whom I said , There comes a Man after me , who is
before me , because he was prior to me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.53

And I did not know him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.54

but for this reason that he should be made manifest to Israel , I came
baptizing with Water . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.55

Besides John testified thus ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.56

I beheld the Spirit come down as a Dove out of Heaven ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.57

and it remained on him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.58

And I did not know him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.59

but the same that sent me to baptize with Water , said to me , He , on
whom thou shalt see the Spirit come down , and remain on him , it is
that baptizes with the Holy Spirit . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.60

So I saw , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.61

and testified that this was the Son of God . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.62

The next Day again John was standing , and two of his Disciples ; When
he looked at Jesus walking and says , Lo the Lamb of God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.63

And the two Disciples heard him speak , whereupon they followed Jesus .
Who turning , when he saw them follow him , asks them , What do ye seek
; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.64

And they said to him , Rabbi <paren> which is to say being interpreted
Master <$$paren> where dost thou remain ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.65

He replies to them , Come , and see PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.66

they came , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.67

and saw where it was , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.68

and remained with him that Day ; it being about the tenth Hour .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.69

<P_1,40J>

One of the two that heard <font> it <$$font> from John , and followed
him , was Andrew , the Brother of Simon Peter .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.71

He first finds out his Brother Simon , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.72

and says to him , We have found the Messias ; which is being interpreted
Christ . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.73

Nay he brought him to Jesus ; who looking on him , said , Thou art Simon
the Son of Jonas , thou shalt be called Cephas ; which is being
interpreted a Rock . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.74

The next Day Jesus was minded to go out into Galilee ; when he finds
Philip , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.75

and says to him , Follow me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.76

Now Philip was from Bethsaida , out of the City of Andrew and Peter .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.77

Philip finds out Nathanael , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.78

and says to him , We have found him of whom Moses in the Law , as also
the Prophets wrote , Jesus the Son of Joseph , from Nazareth . To whom
Nathanael said , Can there be any good Thing from Nazareth ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.79

Philip replies to him , Come , and see . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.80

When Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , he says of him , Lo an
Israelite truly , in whom there is not Deceit .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.81

Nathanael asks him , Whence dost thou know me ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.82

Jesus made answer to him , Before Philip called thee , when thou wast
under the Fig-tree , I saw thee . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.83

Nathanael returns him answer , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.84

thou art the King of Israel ! PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.85

Jesus made reply to him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.86

Because I said to thee , I saw thee underneath the Fig tree , dost thou
believe ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.87

Thou shall see greater Things than these . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.88

I say to thee very certainly , added he to him , Henceforth you shall
see Heaven opened , and the Angels of God go up and come down on the Man
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.89

<P_2,1J>

Chap. II . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.92

<$$heading>

And the third Day there was a Marriage at Cana of Galilee ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.94

and the Mother of Jesus was there . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.95

Besides both Jesus was invited , and his Disciples to the Marriage .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.96

At length there being a want of Wine , the Mother of Jesus says to him ,
They have no Wine . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.97

Jesus answers her , What hast thou to do with me , Woman ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.98

My Hour is not yet come . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.99

His Mother says to the Waiters , Do whatever he bids you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.100

Now six Water-pots of Stone being there , put according to the Cleansing
of the Jews , which held two or three Firkins apiece ; Jesus says to
them , Fill the Water-pots with Water : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.101

so they filled them quite up . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.102

Next he orders them , Draw now , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.103

and carry to the Master of the Feast ; which they did .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.104

And when that Master had tasted the Water become Wine <paren> and did
not know whence it was , though the Waiters who drawed the Water knew
<$$paren> he calls the Bridegroom , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.105

And says to him , Every Man first puts good Wine , and when People have
drunk plentifully , then smaller ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.106

thou hast kept the good Wine till now . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.107

This Beginning of Miracles Jesus did at Cana of Galilee ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.108

and made his Glory manifest ; so that his disciples believed on him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.109

After this he went down to Capernaum with his Mother , Brethren and
Disciples ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.110

but did not remain there many Days . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.111

The Passover of the Jews also was near , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.112

and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.113

And he found in the Temple them who sold Oxen , Sheep and Doves , and
those that changed Coin sitting . Upon which he made a Scourge a Cords
, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.114

and put them all out of the Temple , with the Sheep and Oxen ; as
likewise poured out the Coin of the Money-changers and overturned the
Tables . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.115

Moreover he said to them that sold Doves , Take away these things hence
; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.116

do not make my Father's House a House of Merchandice .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.117

And his Disciples remembred that it was written , The Zeal of thy House
has eat me up . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.118

Therefore the Jews made answer to him , What Sign shewest thou to us ,
since thou doest these Things ? . To whom Jesus made reply ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.119

Demolish this Temple , and in three Days I will raise it up .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.120

<P_2,20J>

The Jews therefore said , Forty_six Years this Temple has been building
, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.122

and wilt thou raise it up in three Days ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.123

Whereas he spoke concerning the Temple of his Body .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.124

Therefore when he was risen up from the Dead , his Disciples remembered
that he had spoken this to them PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.125

so they believed the Scripture , and the Word which Jesus said .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.126

Now as he was in Jerusalem at the Passover on the Feast , many believed
on his Name , at seeing his Miracles which he did .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.127

Yet Jesus did not trust himself to them ; because he knew all , And
since he had no Need that any should testify concerning Man :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.128

for he knew what was in Man . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.129

<P_3,1J>

Chap. III . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.132

<$$heading>

There being also a Man of the Pharisees , whose Name was Nicodemus , a
Ruler of the Jews ; He came to Jesus by Night ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.134

and said to him , Rabbi , we are sensible that thou art a Teacher come
from God : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.135

for none can do these Miracles which thou doest , except God is with him
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.136

Jesus made answer to him ; I tell thee very certainly , Except any one
is born from above , he can@ @not see the Kingdom of God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.137

Nicodemus replies to him , How can a Man be born when he is old ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.138

Can he enter the second time into his Mother's Womb , and be born ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.139

Jesus answered : I tell thee very certainly ; Except any one is born of
Water and the Spirit , he can@ @not enter into the Kingdom of God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.140

What is born of the Flesh , is Flesh ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.141

and what is born of the Spirit , is Spirit . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.142

Do not wonder that I said to thee , You must be born from above .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.143

The Spirit breathes where it will , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.144

and thou hearest the Voice of it , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.145

but dost not know whence it comes , and whither it goes
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.146

so is it with every one who is born of the Spirit .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.147

Nicodemus made answer to him , How can these Things be ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.148

Jesus made reply to him : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.149

Art thou a Teacher of Israel , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.150

and dost not know these Things ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.151

I tell thee very certainly , that we speak what we know , and testify
what we have seen ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.152

yet ye do not receive our Testimony . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.153

If I have told you earthly Things and ye do not believe , how will ye
believe , if I should tell you heavenly Things ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.154

And none has gone up into Heaven , excepting he that came down out of it
, the Man who was in Heaven . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.155

As Moses too put up the Serpent in the Wilderness , so must the Man be
put up ; That every one who believes in him may not perish , but have
everlasting Life . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.156

For God thus loved the World , so that he gave his only begotten Son ,
that every one who believes in him may not perish , but have everlasting
Life . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.157

For God did not send his Son into the World , that he might condemn the
World , but that it might be saved by him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.158

He who believes in him , is not condemned ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.159

but he that does not believe , is condemned already , because he did not
believe in the Name of the only begotten Son of God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.160

Now this is the Condemnation , that Light is come into the World , and
Men loved Darkness rather than Light : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.161

for their Works were wicked . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.162

<P_3,20J>

For every one who commits what is bad , hates the Light ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.164

and does not come to it , that his Works may not be reproved .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.165

Whereas he who does according to the Truth , comes to the Light , that
his Works may be made manifest , because they are wrought through God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.166

After these Things came Jesus , and his Disciples into the Country of
Judea ; where he abode with them , and baptized .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.167

And John also was baptizing at Enon near Salim , because much Water was
there ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.168

so People came , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.169

and were baptized . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.170

For John was not yet cast into Prison . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.171

There was therefore a Question from the disciples of John with the Jews
, about Cleansing . Whereupon they came to John ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.172

and said to him , Rabbi , he who was with thee beyond Jordan , to whom
thou didst testify , behold does baptize , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.173

and all come to him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.174

John made answer : A Man can receive Nothing , except it be given him
from Heaven . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.175

You your selves testify for me , that I said , I am not Christ , but
that I am sent before him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.176

He who has the Bride is the Bride_groom ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.177

but the Friend of the Bridegroom , that stands and hears him , rejoices
with Joy for the Bridegroom's Voice : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.178

this Joy of mine therefore is fulfilled . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.179

He must increase , but I decrease . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.180

He who comes from above , is above all : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.181

he that was of the Earth , is of the Earth , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.182

and speaks of it : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.183

he who comes from Heaven , is above all . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.184

And what he has seen and heard , that he testifies ; though none
receives his Testimony . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.185

He who has received his Testimony , has sealed that God is true .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.186

For he whom God has sent , speaks the Words of God ; since God does not
give <font> him <$$font> the Spirit by Measure .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.187

The Father loves the Son , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.188

and has given all Things into his Power . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.189

He that believes in the Son , has everlasting Life ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.190

and he that is disobedient to the Son , will not see Life ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.191

but the Wrath of God remains on him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.192

<P_4,1J>

<heading>

Chap. IV . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.195

<$$heading>

When therefore the Lord knew , that the Pharisees had heard , that Jesus
made and baptized more Disciples than John ; <paren> However indeed
Jesus himself did not baptize , but his Disciples <$$paren> He left
Judea , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.197

and went away again into Galilee . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.198

And he must go through Samaria . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.199

Therefore he comes to a City of Samaria called Sichar , nigh a Field
which Jacob gave to his Son Joseph . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.200

And Jacob's Well was there ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.201

Jesus therefore being fatigued by the Journey , sat {TEXT:sate} down
accordingly on the Well : it being about the sixth Hour .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.202

A Woman of Samaria coming to draw Water , Jesus says to her , Give me
<font> some <$$font> to drink . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.203

For his Disciples were gone away into the City , that they might buy
Food . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.204

The Woman of Samaria therefore says to him , How dost thou who art a Jew
ask of me to drink , that am a Woman of Samaria ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.205

For the Jews do not deal with the Samaritans .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.206

Jesus made answer to her , If thou hadst known the Gift of God , and who
it is that says to thee , Give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of
him , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.207

and he would have given thee living Water . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.208

The Woman says to him ; Master , thou hast Nothing to draw with ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.209

and the Well is deep ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.210

whence therefore hast thou living Water ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.211

Art thou greater than our Father Jacob , who drank of it himself , his
Children and Cattle ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.212

Jesus made answer to her ; Everyone that drinks of this Water , will be
thirsty again : Whereas whoever drinks of the Water which I shall give
him , will not be thirsty at all for ever ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.213

but the Water which I shall give him , will become in him a Well of
Water bubbling up to everlasting Life . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.214

The Woman requests of him , Master , give me this Water ; that I may not
be thirsty , nor come hither to draw . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.215

Jesus says to her , Go , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.216

call thy Husband , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.217

and come hither . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.218

The Woman made reply , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.219

I have no Husband . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.220

Jesus tells her ; Thou hast said well , I have no Husband .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.221

For thou hast had five Husbands ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.222

and he whom thou hast now is not thy Husband :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.223

this thou saidest truly . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.224

The Woman rejoins to him ; Master , I see that thou art a Prophet .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.225

<P_4,20J>

Our Fathers worshipped on this Mountain ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.227

and you say that in Jerusalem is the Place where one must worship .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.228

To her Jesus says ; Woman , believe me , that the Hour is coming , when
neither on this Mountain , nor in Jerusalem , you will worship the
Father . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.229

You know not what you worship , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.230

we know what we worship ; because Salvation is of the Jews .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.231

But the Hour is coming , and is now , when the true Worshippers shall
worship the Father with the Spirit and the Truth :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.232

for the Father also seeks much to worship him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.233

God is a Spirit ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.234

and those who worship him , must worship him with the Spirit and the
Truth . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.235

The Woman says to him , I know that the Messias is coming , who is
called Christ ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.236

when he is come , he will tell us all Things .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.237

Jesus declares to her , I am <font> he <$$font> , who speak to thee
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.238

And upon this his Disciples came , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.239

and wondered that he talked with the Woman ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.240

nevertheless none said , What dost thou seek ? or , Why talkest thou
with her ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.241

The Woman therefore left her Water pot , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.242

and went into the City , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.243

and says to the Men , Come , see a Man who told me all Things whatever I
did ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.244

is not this Christ ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.245

Therefore they went out of the City PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.246

and came to him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.247

Now in the mean_while his Disciples thus intreated him , Rabbi , do eat
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.248

But he said to them , I have Meat to eat which ye do not know of .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.249

His Disciples therefore said one to another , Has any one brought for
him to eat ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.250

Jesus replies to them ; My Meat is , that I may do the Will of him who
sent me and finish his Work . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.251

Do not ye say , that there are yet four Months , and then Harvest comes
? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.252

Behold I tell you , Look up , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.253

and see that the Grounds are white already towards Harvest .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.254

And he who reaps , does receive Wages , and gather together Fruit for
everlasting Life ; that both he who sows , and he who reaps , may
rejoice together . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.255

For in this the Saying is true , that there is one who sows , and
another who reaps . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.256

I have sent you to reap what you did not labour in :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.257

others laboured , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.258

and you are entered into their Labour . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.259

And many of the Samaritans of that City believed in him , for the Saying
of the Woman , who testified , He told me all Things whatever I did .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.260

<P_4,40J>

When the Samaritans therefore were come to him , they intreated him to
remain with them ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.262

and he remained there two Days . Whereby many more believed for his own
Saying . So that they said to the Woman , We believe no more for thy
speaking ; since we have heard our selves , and know that this is truly
Christ , the Saviour of the World . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.263

But after two Days Jesus came out thence , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.264

and went away into <font> Part of <$$font> Galilee .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.265

For he himself testified , that a Prophet has not Honour in his own
Country . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.266

Therefore when he was come into Galilee , the Galileans received him ,
having seen all the Things which he did in Jerusalem at the Feast :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.267

for they also came to the Feast . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.268

Jesus therefore came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made Water
Wine ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.269

and there was some Nobleman , whose Son was sick at Capernaum .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.270

He hearing that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee , came away to
him , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.271

and intreated him , that he would go down , and heal his Son :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.272

for he was about to die . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.273

Therefore Jesus said to him , Except you see Signs and Wonders , you
will not at all believe . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.274

The Nobleman says to him , Lord , come down , before my Boy dies .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.275

Jesus replies to him , Go ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.276

thy Son will live . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.277

So the Man believed the Saying which Jesus spoke to him ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.278

and went . Whereupon as he was now going down , his Servants met him ,
and declared thus , Thy Boy will live . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.279

He therefore asked of them the Hour in which he got to be better ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.280

and they said to him , Yesterday at the seventh Hour the Fever left him
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.281

The Father therefore knew that it was in the same Hour , in which Jesus
said to him , Thy Son will live ; so that he himself believed , and his
whole Household {TEXT:Houshold} . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.282

This again was the second Miracle Jesus did , after he came out of Judea
into Galilee . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.283

<P_5,1J>

<heading>

Chap. V . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.286

<$$heading>

After these Things there was a Feast of the Jews ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.288

and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.289

And there is in Jerusalem at the Sheep <font> gate <$$font> a Pool ,
which is called in Hebrew Bethesda , that has five Porches .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.290

In these lay a great Multitude of ailing Persons , blind , lame ,
withered , waiting for the moving of the Water .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.291

For an Angel came down into the Pool according to the Time ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.292

and disturbed the Water ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.293

he therefore who first went in after the disturbing of it , became well
, whensoever he had been seized with a Distemper .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.294

Now some Man was there , who had been in an Ailment thirty_eight Years .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.295

Jesus seeing him lie , as he knew that it had been now a great while ,
says to him , Wilt thou become well ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.296

He who was ailing answered him , Lord , I have no Man , that when the
Water is disturbed , may put me into the Pool ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.297

but while I am coming , another goes down before me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.298

Jesus says to him , Arise , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.299

take up thy Bed , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.300

and go . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.301

And presently the Man became well , so that he took up his Bed , and
went ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.302

and the Sabbath was on that Day . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.303

Therefore the Jews said to him who was cured , This is the Sabbath ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.304

it is not lawful for thee to take up the Bed .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.305

He answered them ; The same who made me well , said to me , Take up thy
Bed , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.306

and go . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.307

They therefore asked him ; What Man is it who spoke these Words to thee
? Whereas he that was healed did not know who it was :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.308

for Jesus was withdrawn , while a Company was in the Place .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.309

After these Things Jesus finds him in the Temple ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.310

and said to him , Lo thou art become well ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.311

sin no more , that Something worse may not come to thee .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.312

The Man went away , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.313

and told the Jews , that it was Jesus who had made him well .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.314

And for this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.315

and endeavoured to kill him , because he had done these Things on the
Sabbath . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.316

But Jesus answered them , My Father works hitherto ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.317

and I work . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.318

For this reason therefore the Jews endeavoured the more to kill him ,
because he not only disannulled the Sabbath , but also said God was his
Father , making himself equal to God . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.319

Therefore Jesus made answer to them : I say to you very certainly ; The
Son can@ @not do any Thing of himself , excepting what he sees the
Father do : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.320

for what Things soever he does , these also the Son does in like Manner
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.321

<P_5,20J>

For the Father loves the Son , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.323

and shews him all Things which himself does ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.324

nay he will shew him greater Things than these , that you may wonder .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.325

For according as the Father raises up the Dead , and makes alive ; so
the Son also makes alive them that he will .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.326

For the Father does not judge any , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.327

but has given all Judgment to the Son ; That all might honour the Son ,
as they do the Father . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.328

He that honours not the Son , does not honour the Father who sent him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.329

I tell you very certainly , that he who hears my Word , and believes in
him who sent me , has everlasting Life ; and does not come into Judgment
, but is departed out of Death into Life . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.330

I say to you very certainly , that the Hour is coming , and now is ,
when the Dead will hear the Voice of the Son of God ; and those who hear
, will live . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.331

For according as the Father has Life in himself , so has he given to the
Son to have Life in himself ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.332

Nay has given him Authority even to execute Judgment , because he is the
Man . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.333

Do not wonder at this : since the Hour is coming , in which all who are
in the Graves will hear his Voice ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.334

And those who do good Things will come out to the Resurrection of Life ,
but they that commit bad ones to the Resurrection of Damnation .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.335

I can@ @not do any Thing of my self : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.336

as I hear , I judge , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.337

and my Judgment is righteous ; because I seek not my own Will , but the
Will of the Father who sent me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.338

If I <font> only <$$font> testify concerning my self , my Testimony is
not a true one . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.339

There is another who testifies concerning me ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.340

and I know that the Testimony which he testifies concerning me is true .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.341

You sent to John , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.342

and he testified to the Truth . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.343

However I do not receive Testimony from Man ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.344

but say these Things , that you may be saved .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.345

He was a burning and shining Lamp ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.346

and you were willing for a little while to be joyful in his Light .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.347

Yet I have greater Testimony than John's : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.348

for the Works which the Father has given me , that I might finish them ,
these Works which I do , testify concerning me , that the Father sent me
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.349

The Father also who sent me , has himself testified concerning me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.350

You have neither ever heard his Voice , nor seen his Appearance .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.351

Moreover you have not his Word remaining in you ; because the same whom
he has sent , him you do not believe . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.352

You search the Scriptures , because you think to find everlasting Life
in them ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.353

and those are they that testify concerning me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.354

<P_5,40J>

Nevertheless you will not come to me , that you may have Life .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.356

I do not receive Glory from Men . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.357

But I know that you have not the Love of God in your selves .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.358

I am come in the Name of my Father , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.359

and you do not receive me : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.360

if another should come in his own Name , you would receive him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.361

How can you believe , who receive Glory one from another , and do not
seek the Glory which is from God alone ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.362

Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.363

it is Moses who accuses you , in whom you hope .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.364

For if you had believed Moses , you would have believed me :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.365

for he wrote concerning me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.366

But if you do not believe his Writings , how should you believe my
Sayings ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.367

<P_6,1J>

<heading>

Chap. VI . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.370

<$$heading>

After these Things Jesus went away beyond the Sea of Galilee , that of
Tiberias . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.372

And a great Company followed him , because they saw his Miracles which
he did on those who were ailing . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.373

So Jesus went up on a Mountain , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.374

and sat {TEXT:sate} there with his Disciples .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.375

Moreover the Passover , a Feast of the Jews , was near .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.376

Jesus therefore looked up , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.377

and seeing a great Company come to him , says to Philip , Whence shall
we buy Bread , that these may eat ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.378

<paren> But he said this to try him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.379

for he himself knew what he was about to do <$$paren>
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.380

Philip answered him , Two_hundred Penny-worth of Bread is not sufficient
for them , that each of them may take some Little .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.381

One of his Disciples , Andrew the Brother of Simon Peter , says to him ,
There is a Boy here who has five Barley-loaves , and two little Fishes ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.382

but what are these for so many ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.383

However Jesus said , Make the Persons sit down ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.384

and there was much Grass in the Place : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.385

the Men accordingly sat {TEXT:sate} down , in Number about five_thousand
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.386

When Jesus took the Loaves , and giving thanks , gave to the Disciples ,
and they to those who were sat {TEXT:sate} down ; and in like Manner of
the little Fishes , as much as they would have . And when they were
filled , he says to his Disciples , Gather together the Fragments which
are over and above , that there may not any Thing be lost .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.387

Therefore they gathered together , and filled twelve Baskets with the
Fragments of the five Barley-loaves , which were over and above to them
that eat . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.388

The Men therefore seeing the Miracle which Jesus did , said , This is
truly the Prophet who was to come into the World .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.389

Jesus therefore knowing that they were about to come , and take him by
force , that they might make him King , departed again to a Mountain
himself alone . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.390

And when it was Evening , his Disciples went down to the Sea . Where
they got aboard a Ship , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.391

and were going beyond the Sea to Capernaum ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.392

and it was now dark , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.393

besides Jesus was not come to them . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.394

And the Sea rose up , by a great Wind blowing .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.395

Therefore having driven on about twenty_five or thirty Furlongs , they
see Jesus walking on the Sea , and being near the Ship ; at which they
were afraid . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.396

<P_6,20J>

But he says to them , It is I , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.398

do not fear ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.399

They were desirous therefore to receive him into the Ship ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.400

and this it self was presently at the Land to which they were going .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.401

The next Day the Company who stood on the farther Side of the Sea ,
seeing that no other Boat was there , but that one into which his
Disciples were gone , and that Jesus was not entered with his Disciples
into the Boat , but they went away alone ; But yet other Boats came from
Tiberias , near the Place where they had eat Bread , the Lord having
given thanks : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.402

When the Company therefore saw that Jesus was not there , nor his
Disciples ; they also went into a Ship , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.403

and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.404

And finding him beyond the Sea , they said to him , Rabbi , when didst
thou come hither ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.405

Jesus made answer to them ; I tell you very certainly , You seek for me
, not because you saw the Miracles , but because you did eat of the
Loaves , and were filled . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.406

Do not work for the Meat that perishes , but for the Meat that remains
to everlasting Life , which the Man will give you :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.407

for God the Father has sealed him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.408

They therefore said to him , What shall we do , that we may work the
Work of God ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.409

Jesus made reply to them , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.410

This is the Work of God , that you should believe in him whom he has
sent . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.411

Therefore they said to him ; What Miracle doest thou , that we may see ,
and believe thee ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.412

What dost thou work ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.413

Our Forefathers did eat Manna in the Wilderness ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.414

as it is written , He gave them Bread to eat from Heaven .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.415

Jesus therefore said to them ; I tell you very certainly , Moses did not
give you the Bread from Heaven ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.416

but my Father gives you the true Bread from Heaven .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.417

For the Bread of God is that which comes down from Heaven , and gives
Life to the World . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.418

They therefore said to him , Lord , always give us this Bread . Upon
which Jesus replied to them : I am the Bread of Life ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.419

he that comes to me shall not be hungry at all ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.420

and he who believes in me shall never be thirsty at all .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.421

But I have said to you , that you have even seen me , and do not believe
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.422

All whom the Father gives me shall come to me ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.423

and him that comes to me I will not at all cast forth abroad : Because I
am come down from Heaven , not that I should do my own Will , but the
Will of him who sent me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.424

And this is the Will of the Father who sent me , that all whom he has
given me I should lose none of it , but raise it up at the last Day .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.425

<P_6,40J>

This is likewise the Will of him who sent me , that every one who sees
the Son , and believes in him , shall have everlasting Life and I will
raise him up at the last Day . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.427

The Jews therefore murmured at him , because he said , I am the Bread
that came down from Heaven . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.428

And they said , Is not this Jesus the Son of Joseph , whose Father and
Mother we know ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.429

How then does he say , I am come down from Heaven ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.430

Therefore Jesus made answer to them : Do not murmur with one another .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.431

None can come to me , except the Father who sent me draws him ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.432

and I will raise him up at the last Day . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.433

It is written in the Prophets , And they shall be all taught by God :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.434

every one therefore who has heard from the Father , and learned , shall
come to me . Not that any has seen the Father , excepting he who is
from God ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.435

this has seen the Father . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.436

I say to you very certainly ; He who believes in me has everlasting Life
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.437

I am the Bread of Life . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.438

Your Forefathers did eat Manna in the Wilderness ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.439

yet are dead . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.440

This is the Bread which comes down from Heaven , that any one may eat of
it , and not die . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.441

I am the living Bread , which came down from Heaven :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.442

if any one eats of this Bread , he will live for ever ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.443

and the Bread too that I will give , is my Flesh , which I will give for
the Life of the World . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.444

The Jews therefore contended one with another , saying , How can he give
us the Flesh to eat ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.445

Therefore Jesus said to them : I tell you very certainly ; Except you
eat the Flesh of the Man , and drink his Blood , you have not Life in
your selves . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.446

He that eats my Flesh , and drinks my Blood , has everlasting Life ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.447

and I will raise him up at the last Day . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.448

For my Flesh truly is Meat , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.449

and my Blood truly is Drink . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.450

He that eats my Flesh , and drinks my Blood , remains in me , and I in
him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.451

As the Living Father has sent me , and I live by the Father ; even the
same who eats me , shall also live by me , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.452

This <font> that <$$font> is the Bread which came down from Heaven ; not
as your Forefathers did eat Manna , yet are dead :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.453

he that eats this Bread will live for ever .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.454

These Things he said in the Synagogue , while he taught at Capernaum .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.455

<P_6,60J>

When many of his Disciples therefore heard , they said , This is a hard
Matter , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.457

who can hear it ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.458

Now Jesus knowing in himself that his Disciples murmured about it , said
to them ; Does this offend you ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.459

<font> How <$$font> if therefore you should see the Man go up where he
was before ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.460

It is the Spirit that makes alive , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.461

the Flesh does not profit any Thing : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.462

<font> of <$$font> the Words which I speak to you , it is the Spirit ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.463

and it is the Life . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.464

But there are some of you that do not believe .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.465

For Jesus knew from the Beginning who they were that did not believe ,
and who it was that would deliver him up . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.466

He further added , For this reason I said to you , that none can come to
me , except it is given to him from my Father .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.467

Thenceforth many of his Disciples went away back ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.468

and walked no more with him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.469

Jesus therefore said to the twelve , Are you also minded to go ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.470

Therefore Simon Peter answered him ; Lord , to whom should we go away ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.471

Thou hast the Words of everlasting Life . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.472

And we believe and know , that thou art Christ the Son of the Living God
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.473

Jesus replied to them , Have not I chosen you twelve , and one of you is
a Devil ? Which he spoke of Judas Isariot <font> the Son <$$font> of
Simon : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.474

for he would deliver him up , who was one of the twelve .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.475

<P_7,1J>

Chap. VII . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.478

<$$heading>

And Jesus after these Things walked in Galilee :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.480

for he would not walk in Judea , because the Jews endeavoured to kill
him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.481

Moreover the Jews Feast of Tabernacles was near .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.482

His Brethren therefore said to him ; Depart hence ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.483

and go into Judea ; that thy Disciples may also see thy Works which thou
doest . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.484

For none does any Thing in Secret , when he himself seeks to be in
Publick : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.485

if thou doest these Things , make thy self manifest to the World .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.486

For his Brethren did not believe in him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.487

Jesus therefore says to them ; My Time is not yet come ; whereas yours
is always ready . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.488

The World can@ @not hate you ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.489

but me it hates , because I testify concerning it , that its Deeds are
wicked . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.490

Get you up to this Feast : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.491

I go not up to it yet , because my Time is not yet fulfilled .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.492

So having said these Things to them , he remained in Galilee .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.493

However when his Brethren were gone up , then he also went up to the
Feast , not openly , but as it were in Secret ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.494

Therefore the Jews sought for him at the Feast ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.495

and said , Where is he ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.496

And there was much Murmuring about him among the Multitude :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.497

some indeed said ; He is good ; whereas others said , No , but he
seduces the Company . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.498

Nevertheless none spoke in Publick concerning him , through Fear of the
Jews . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.499

Now at length it being the middle of the Feast , Jesus went up to the
Temple , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.500

and taught . Whereupon the Jews wondered , saying , How does he know
the Scriptures , when he has not learned ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.501

Jesus made answer to them ; My Doctrine is not my Own , but his who sent
me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.502

If any one likes to do his Will , he shall know concerning the Doctrine
, whether it is from God , or I speak of my self .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.503

He that speaks of himself , seeks his own Glory ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.504

but the same that seeks his Glory who sent him , is true ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.505

and there is not Unrighteousness in him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.506

Did not Moses give you the Law , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.507

and none of you performs it ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.508

Why do you seek to kill me ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.509

<P_7,20J>

The Company made answer , Thou hast the Devil , who seeks to kill thee .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.511

Jesus made reply to them ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.512

I have done one Work , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.513

and you all wonder . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.514

For this reason Moses gave you Circumcision <paren> not that it is from
Moses , but from the Fathers <$$paren> PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.515

and on the Sabbath you circumcise a Male . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.516

If a Male on the Sabbath receive Circumcision , that the Law of Moses
may not be disannulled ; are you enraged at me , because I have made a
Person all over well on the Sabbath ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.517

Do not judge according to the Sight , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.518

but judge righteous Judgment . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.519

Some therefore of those of Jerusalem said ; Is not this he whom they
seek to kill ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.520

Whereas lo he speaks in Publick , and they say Nothing to him ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.521

have the Rulers known of a truth at any time , that this truly is Christ
? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.522

Yet we know whence this is ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.523

but when Christ comes , none knows whence he is .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.524

Therefore Jesus cried out in the Temple , teaching , and saying ; You
both know me , and know whence I am ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.525

yet I am not come of my self , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.526

but he that sent me is true , whom you know not .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.527

I notwithstanding know him ; because I am from him , and he has sent me
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.528

They sought therefore to apprehend him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.529

however none put Hand on him , because his Hour was not yet come .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.530

Nay many of the Company believed in him , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.531

and said , When Christ comes , will he do more Miracles than these which
this has done ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.532

The Pharisees heard of the Company murmuring these Things concerning him
; whereupon they , and the chief Priests , sent Officers to apprehend
him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.533

Jesus therefore said to them ; Yet a little while I am with you ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.534

then I go to him who sent me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.535

You will seek me , and not find ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.536

and where I am , you can@ @not come . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.537

Therefore the Jews said to themselves ; Whither is he about to go , that
we may not find him ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.538

Is he about to go to the disapersed ones of the Greeks , and teach the
Greeks ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.539

What Saying is this which he said , You will seek me , and not find ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.540

and where I am , you can@ @not come ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.541

On the last Day too , the great one of the Feast , Jesus stood ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.542

and cried out as follows ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.543

If any one is thirsty , let him come to me , and drink .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.544

He that believes in me , as the Scripture said , Rivers of living Water
will slow out of his Inside . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.545

<paren> But this he said concerning the Spirit , which they should
receive who believed in him : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.546

for there was not the Holy Spirit yet , because Jesus was not yet
glorified <$$paren> . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.547

<P_7,40J>

Many of the Company therefore hearing the Words , said , This truly is
the Prophet . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.549

Others said , This is Christ . But others again ; Will Christ forsooth
come out of Galilee ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.550

Did not the Scripture say , that Christ comes out of David's Offspring ,
and from Bethlehem the Town , where David was ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.551

There became therefore a Division in the Company by reason of him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.552

And some of them would have apprehended him ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.553

but none put Hands on him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.554

So the Officers came to the chief Priests and Pharisees ; who said to
them , For what reason did not you bring him ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.555

The Officers answered , Never did a Man speak so as this Man .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.556

The Pharisees therefore replied to them ; Are you also seduced ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.557

Have any of the Rulers believed in him , or of the Pharisees ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.558

But this Company , who are ignorant of the Law , are cursed .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.559

Nicodemus says to them , he who came to Jesus by Night , being one of
them , Does our Law judge a Man , except it has first heard from him ,
and knows what he does ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.560

They made answer to him , Art thou also from Galilee ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.561

Find , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.562

and see , that no Prophet rises up from Galilee .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.563

Thus each went to his House . : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.564

<P_8,1J>

<heading>

Chap. VIII . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.567

<$$heading>

Besides Jesus went to the Mount of Olives . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.569

And when it was Break of Day he came into the Temple ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.570

and all the People came to him ; at which he sat {TEXT:sate} down , and
taught them . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.571

The Scribes and Pharisees also brought to him a Woman taken in Adultery
; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.572

and setting her in the midst , They say to him ; Master , this Woman was
taken in the Crime it self of committing Adultery .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.573

Now in the Law Moses commanded us , that such a one should be stoned ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.574

what dost thou therefore say ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.575

Whereas they said this , by trying him , that they might have <font>
Something <$$font> to accuse him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.576

but Jesus stooped down , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.577

and wrote with his Finger on the Ground . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.578

However as they continued asking him , he stood upright ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.579

and said to them , Let him of you that is without Sin first throw a
Stone at her . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.580

And again he stooped down , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.581

and wrote on the Ground . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.582

This they hearing , and checked by Conscience , went out one by one ,
proceeding first from the eldest to the last ; so that Jesus was left
alone , and the Woman standing in the middle Place .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.583

At length Jesus stood upright , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.584

and when he saw Nobody besides the Woman , he said to her , Woman ,
where are those Accusers of thine ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.585

Has none condemned thee ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.586

And she said , None , Lord . Upon which Jesus replied to her , Neither
do I condemn thee ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.587

go , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.588

and sin no more . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.589

Jesus therefore spoke again to them as follows ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.590

I am the Light of the World : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.591

he that follows me , shall not at all walk in Darkness , but have the
Light of Life . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.592

Therefore the Pharisees said to him , Thou testifiest concerning thy
self ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.593

thy Testimony is not a true one . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.594

Jesus made answer to them ; Though I do testify concerning my self , my
Testimony is a true one ; since I know whence I came , and whither I am
going : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.595

but you know neither whence I come , or whether I am going .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.596

You judge according to the Flesh , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.597

I do not judge any one . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.598

And yet if I judge , my Judgment is true ; because I am not alone ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.599

but as well as I there is the Father who sent me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.600

Nay it is written also in your Law , that the Testimony of two Men is a
true one . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.601

I am one that testifies concerning my self , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.602

however the Father who sent me testifies concerning me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.603

They therefore said to him , Where is thy Father ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.604

Jesus answered , You neither know me , nor my Father :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.605

if you knew me , you would also have known my Father .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.606

<P_8,20J>

These Things spoke Jesus in the Treasury , when he taught in the Temple
; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.608

and none apprehended him , because his Hour was not yet come .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.609

Therefore Jesus said again to them , I am going ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.610

and though you may seek me , yet will die in your Sins ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.611

<font> then <$$font> whither I am going , you can@ @not come .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.612

The Jews therefore said ; Will he kill himself , because he says ,
Whither I am going , you can@ @not come . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.613

And he answered them ; You are from below , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.614

I am from above : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.615

you are of this World , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.616

I am not of this World . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.617

I therefore said to you , that you will die in your Sins :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.618

for if you do not believe that I am <font> so <$$font> you will die in
your Sins . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.619

Therefore they asked him , Who art thou ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.620

And Jesus replied to them ; Even he whom I told you at the Beginning .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.621

I have many Things concerning you to say , and judge ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.622

but he who sent me is true , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.623

and those Things which I have heard from him I speak in the World .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.624

They did not know that he spoke to them <font> of <$$font> the Father .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.625

Jesus therefore said to them ; When you have lifted up the Man , then
will you know that I am <font> so <$$font> and that I do Nothing of my
self ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.626

but as my Father has taught me , I speak these Things .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.627

And he who sent me is with me : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.628

the Father has not left me alone , since I always do the Things that
please him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.629

He speaking these Things , many believed in him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.630

Therefore Jesus said to the Jews who did ; If you remain in my Word ,
you truly are my Disciples . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.631

Moreover you will know the Truth PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.632

and that will make you free . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.633

They answered him ; We are the Offspring of Abraham ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.634

and have never been in Servitude to any ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.635

how dost thou say , You will become free ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.636

Jesus answered them ; I say to you very certainly , that every one who
does Sin is a Servant of Sin . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.637

Now a Servant does not remain in the House for ever ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.638

the Son remains for ever . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.639

If therefore the Son Shall make you free , you will really be free .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.640

I know that you are the Offspring of Abraham ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.641

but you seek to kill me , because my word does not come into you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.642

speak what I have seen with my father ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.643

and you therefore do what you have seen with yours .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.644

They made answer to him , Abraham is our Father .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.645

Jesus replies to them ; If you were Abraham's Children , you would
indeed do the Deeds of Abraham . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.646

<P_8,40J>

But now you seek to kill me , a Man who has spoken the Truth to you ,
which I heard from God : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.648

this Abraham did not do . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.649

You do the Deeds of your Father . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.650

Therefore they said to him , We are not born of Whoredom :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.651

we have one Father , <font> namely <$$font> God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.652

Jesus therefore said to them : If God were your Father , you would love
me : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.653

for I came forth , and am come , from God ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.654

nor indeed did I come of my self , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.655

but he sent me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.656

For what reason do ye not know my Speaking ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.657

Because you can@ @not hear my Word . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.658

You are from your Father the Devil , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.659

and the Desires of your Father you like to do .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.660

He was a Murderer from the Beginning , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.661

and did not stand in the Truth , because the Truth is not in him ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.662

when he speaks a Lye , he speaks of his own ; because he is a Liar , and
the Father of it . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.663

And because I tell the Truth , you do not believe me .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.664

Which of you convinces me of Sin ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.665

And if I tell the Truth , for what reason do ye not believe me ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.666

He that is from God , hears God's Sayings : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.667

for this reason ye do not hear , because ye are not from God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.668

Therefore the Jews made answer to him , Do not we say well , that thou
art a Samaritan , and hast a Devil ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.669

Jesus answered ; I have not a Devil ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.670

but I honour my Father , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.671

and you dishonour me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.672

Nay I do not seek my own Glory : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.673

there is one who seeks , and judges . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.674

I say to you very certainly , If any one observes my Word , he will not
at all see Death for ever . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.675

The Jews therefore replied to him ; Now we know that thou hast a Devil :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.676

Abraham is dead , and the Prophets , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.677

yet thou <font> sayest <$$font> , If any one observes my Word , he will
not at all taste Death for ever . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.678

Art thou greater than our Father Abraham , who is dead ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.679

And the Prophets are dead : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.680

whom dost thou make thy self ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.681

Jesus answered ; If I glorify my self , my Glory is Nothing :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.682

it is my Father who glorifies me , of whom you say that he is your God .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.683

Nevertheless you have not known him , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.684

but I know him : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.685

and if I say that I do not know him , I should be a Liar like you ;
whereas I know him , and observe his Word . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.686

Your Father Abraham was joyful that he should see my Day ; which he saw
, and rejoiced . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.687

Therefore the Jews said to him , Thou art not yet fifty Years old ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.688

and hast thou beheld Abraham ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.689

Jesus said to them ; I tell you very certainly , Before Abraham was I am
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.690

They therefore took up Stones , that they might throw at him ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.691

but Jesus hid , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.692

and went out of the Temple , going through the midst of them ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.693

and passed away so . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.694

<P_9,1J>

<heading>

Chap. IX . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.697

<$$heading>

Moreover passing away , he saw a Man blind from the Birth .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.699

And his Disciples asked him as follows , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.700

Rabbi , who sinned , he or his Parents , that he was born blind ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.701

Jesus answered ; Neither did he sin , nor his Parents ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.702

but <font> it <$$font> was that the Works of God might be made manifest
in him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.703

I must work the Works of him who sent me , while it is Day :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.704

the Night comes , when none can work . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.705

As long as I am in the World , I am the Light of the World .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.706

Having said these Things , he spit on the Ground ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.707

and made Clay of the Spittle , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.708

and anointed with the Clay upon the Eyes of the blind Man ; As also said
to him , Go , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.709

wash in the Pool of Siloam <paren> which being interpreted is Sent
<$$paren> PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.710

he went away therefore , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.711

and washed , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.712

and came seeing . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.713

Therefore the Neighbours , and they who had seen before that he was
blind , said , Is not this he that sat {TEXT:sate} , and begged ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.714

Others said , This is he ; but others , He is like him :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.715

<font> however <$$font> he said , It is I . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.716

They therefore enquired of him , How were the Eyes opened for thee ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.717

He made answer ; A Man called Jesus made Clay ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.718

and anointed my Eyes , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.719

and said to me , Go to the Pool of Siloam , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.720

and wash ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.721

so when I went away , and washed , I had sight .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.722

Therefore they said to him , Where is he ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.723

Says he , I know not . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.724

They bring him to the Pharisees who once was blind .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.725

Now it was the Sabbath when Jesus made the Clay , and opened his Eyes .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.726

The Pharisees therefore asked him also again , how he had sight . To
whom he said , He put Clay upon my Eyes , and I washed , and do see .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.727

Therefore some of the Pharisees said , This Man is not from God ,
because he does not keep the Sabbath . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.728

Others said , How can a Man <font> who <$$font> is a Sinner do such
Miracles ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.729

Thus there was a Division among them . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.730

They say to the blind Man again , What dost thou say concerning him ,
that he has opened thy Eyes ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.731

But he said , He is a Prophet . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.732

The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him , that he was blind ,
and had sight ; until they called the Parents of him who had sight , And
asked them as follows , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.733

Is this your Son , of whom you say that he was born blind ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.734

How then does he now see ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.735

<P_9,20J>

His Parents made answer to them ; We know that this is our Son , and
that he was born blind . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.737

But how he now sees we know not , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.738

or who opened his Eyes we do not know : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.739

he is of Age , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.740

ask him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.741

he will speak concerning himself . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.742

These Things said his Parents , because they feared the Jews :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.743

for the Jews had already agreed , that if any one did confess him to be
Christ , he should not belong to the Synagogue .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.744

For this reason his Parents said , He is of Age ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.745

ask him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.746

Therefore they called the Man who was blind the second time ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.747

and said to him Ascribe Glory to God ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.748

we know that this Man is a Sinner . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.749

He therefore made answer , Whether he is a Sinner I know not ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.750

one Thing I know , that having been blind , I now see .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.751

Whereupon they said to him again , What did he do to thee ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.752

How opened he thy Eyes ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.753

He answered , I have told you already , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.754

and you did not hearken ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.755

why would you hear again ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.756

Would you also become his Disciples ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.757

They therefore railed at him , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.758

and said ; Thou art a Disciple of him , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.759

but we are Disciples of Moses . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.760

We know that God spoke to Moses ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.761

but we know not whence this Man is . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.762

The Man made reply to them ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.763

In this indeed there is a wonderful Thing , that you know not whence he
is , when he has opened my Eyes . Since we know that God hears not
Sinners ; but if any one be a Worshipper of God , and does his Will ,
him he hears . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.764

Since the World has been it has not been heard , that any Man opened the
Eyes of one born blind . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.765

If he was not from God , he could not do any Thing .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.766

They made answer to him , Thou wast wholly born in Sins ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.767

and dost thou teach us ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.768

So they put him out . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.769

Jesus heard that they put him out , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.770

and finding him , he said to him , Dost thou believe in the Son of God ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.771

He made answer , Who is it , Lord , that I may believe in him ? At
which Jesus said to him , Thou hast both seen him ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.772

and it is he that talks with thee . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.773

Upon this he said , I believe , Lord ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.774

and worshipped him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.775

Besides Jesus said , For Judgment am I come into this World ; that those
who see not may see , and those who see may become blind .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.776

<P_9,40J>

And some of the Pharisees being with him heard these Things ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,40J.778

and said to him , Are we also blind ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,40J.779

Jesus answered them : If you were blind , you would not have Sin ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,40J.780

but now you say , We see ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,40J.781

therefore your Sin remains . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,40J.782

<P_10,1J>

<heading>

Chap. X . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.785

<$$heading>

I say to you very certainly ; That Person who does not enter at the Gate
into the Sheep-fold , but climbs up elsewhere , is a Thief and a Robber
. Whereas he who enters at the Gate , is the Shepherd of the Sheep .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.787

To him the Porter opens , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.788

and the Sheep hear his Voice ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.789

he also calls his own Sheep by Name , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.790

and brings them out . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.791

And when he puts forth his own Sheep , he goes before them ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.792

moreover the Sheep follow him , because they know his Voice .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.793

Nay they will not follow another at all , but run away from him ;
because they know not the Voice of others . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.794

This Proverb Jesus said to them ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.795

yet they did not know what Things those were which he spoke to them .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.796

Jesus therefore said to them again : I tell you very certainly , that I
am the Gate of the Sheep . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.797

All that ever came before me , are Thieves and Robbers ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.798

but the Sheep did not hear them . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.799

I am the Gate : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.800

at me if any one comes in , he shall be saved ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.801

nay shall come in , and go out , and find Pasture .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.802

The Thief does not come , except that he may steal , kill , and destroy
: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.803

I am come that they may have Life , and have <font> it <$$font> more
abundantly . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.804

I am the good Shepherd : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.805

it is he yields up his Life for the Sheep . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.806

But he that is a hired one , and not the Shepherd , whose own the Sheep
are not , sees the Wolf coming , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.807

and leaves the Sheep , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.808

and flees ; so that the Wolf catches them , and disperses the Sheep .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.809

Thus the hired one flees , because he is hired , and has no Care about
the Sheep . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.810

I am the good Shepherd , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.811

and know mine , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.812

and am known by mine . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.813

As the Father knows me , I also know the Father ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.814

and yield up my Life for the Sheep . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.815

And other Sheep I have that are not of this Fold ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.816

and those I must bring , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.817

and they shall hear what I say ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.818

so there shall be one Sheep-fold , one Shepherd .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.819

For this reason my Father loves me , because I yield up my Life , that I
may receive it again . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.820

None takes it from me , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.821

but I yield it up of my self : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.822

I have Authority to yield it up , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.823

and have Authority to receive it again . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.824

The Commandment for this have I received from my Father .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.825

There was a Division therefore again among the Jews , by these Words .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.826

And many of them said , He has a Devil , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.827

and is mad ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.828

why do ye hear him ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.829

<P_10,20J>

Others said , These are not the Words of one in whom the Devil is ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.831

can a Devil open the Eyes of the Blind ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.832

Now there was the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem , when it was Winter
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.833

And Jesus walked in the Temple , in Solomon's Porch .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.834

The Jews therefore compassed him about , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.835

and said to him , How long dost thou hold our Mind in doubt ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.836

If thou art Christ , tell us freely . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.837

Jesus answered them : I have told you , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.838

and ye did not believe : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.839

those Works which I do in the Name of my Father , testify concerning me
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.840

But ye do not believe : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.841

for ye are not any of my Sheep , as I told you .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.842

My Sheep hear my Voice , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.843

and I know them , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.844

and they follow me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.845

So I give them everlasting Life , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.846

and they shall not at all perish for ever , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.847

nor shall any one pull them out of my Hand .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.848

My Father who gave to me , is greater than all ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.849

and none can pull out of my Father's Hand .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.850

I and the Father are one . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.851

Therefore the Jews again carried Stones , that they might stone him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.852

Jesus answered them , Many good Works have I shewn you from my Father ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.853

for which of those Works do ye stone me ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.854

The Jews made him answer , We do not stone thee about a good Work , but
about Blasphemy , and because thou that art a Man , makest thy self God
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.855

Jesus replied to them : Is it not written in your Law ; I said , You are
gods ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.856

If he called those gods , to whom the Word of God was , and the
Scripture can@ @not be disannulled ; Do ye tell him whom the Father has
sanctified , and sent into the World , Thou blasphemest ; because I said
, I am the Son of God ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.857

If I do not the Works of my Father , believe me not .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.858

But if I do , though you believe me not , believe the Works ; that you
may know , and believe that the Father is in me , and I in him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.859

They therefore sought again to apprehend him ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.860

but he got away from their Hand . <P_10,40J> When he went away again
beyond Jordan , into the Place where John was first baptizing ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,40J.861

and he remained there . Whereupon many came to him , and said , John
indeed did no Miracle , but all Things whatever John spoke concerning
him were true . So that many believed in him there .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,40J.862

<P_11,1J>

<heading>

Chap. XI . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.865

<$$heading>

Now there was a certain Man sick , <font> one <$$font> Lazarus of
Bethany , the Town of Mary and her Sister Martha .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.867

<paren> And it was the Mary who anointed the Lord with Ointment , and
wiped his Feet with her Hair , whose Brother Lazarus was sick <$$paren>
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.868

Therefore the Sisters sent Word to him , Lord , behold he whom Thou
lovest is sick . Which Jesus hearing , said , This Sickness is not to
Death , but for the Glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified
by it . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.869

Moreover Jesus loved Martha , and her Sister , as well as Lazarus .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.870

When he heard therefore that the other was sick , then indeed he
remained at the Place in which he was two Days .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.871

Next he after that says to the Disciples , Let us go along into Judea
again . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.872

The Disciples say to him , Rabbi , the Jews now have attempted to stone
thee , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.873

and dost thou again go thither ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.874

Jesus answered ; Are there not twelve Hours to a Day ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.875

If any one walks in the Day , he does not stumble , because he sees the
Light of this World . Whereas if any one walks in the Night , he
stumbles , because there is not Light in it .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.876

These Things he said ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.877

and after that he says to them , Our Friend Lazarus is asleep ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.878

but I am going that I may awake him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.879

Therefore his Disciples said , Lord , if he is asleep , he will be well
. PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.880

But Jesus spoke concerning his Death ; whereas they thought that he
discoursed about being in a Sleep . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.881

Then Jesus therefore said to them publickly , Lazarus is dead .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.882

And I am glad by reason of you <paren> in order for you to believe
<$$paren> that I was not there ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.883

but let us go along to him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.884

Therefore said Thomas , who is called Didymus , to his Fellow-disciples
, Let us also go along , that we may die with him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.885

Jesus therefore came , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.886

and found he had been four Days already in the Grave .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.887

<paren> Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , about fifteen Furlongs off
<$$paren> PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.888

And many of the Jews were come about Martha and Mary , that they might
comfort them concerning their Brother . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.889

<P_11,20J>

Martha therefore when she heard that Jesus was coming , met him ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.891

but Mary sat {TEXT:sate} in the House . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.892

Therefore Martha said to Jesus ; Lord , if Thou hadst been here , my
Brother would not have been dead . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.893

But yet now I know that whatever Thou shalt ask God for , God will give
thee . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.894

Jesus says to her , Thy Brother will arise .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.895

Martha says to him , I know that he will arise in the Resurrection on
the last Day . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.896

Jesus replied to her ; I am the Resurrection , and Life :
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.897

he that believes in me will be alive , though he is dead .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.898

And every one who is alive , and believes in me will not die at all for
ever ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.899

dost thou believe this ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.900

She says to him , Yes , Lord : I believe that thou art Christ the Son of
God , who should come into the World . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.901

And having said these Things , she went away ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.902

and called her Sister Mary privately , saying , The Master is come ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.903

and calls for thee . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.904

When she heard , she rose up quickly , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.905

and came to him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.906

However Jesus was not yet come into the Town ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.907

but was in the Place where Martha met him .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.908

The Jews therefore who were with her in the House , and were comforting
her , when they saw that Mary arose quickly , and went out , followed
her , saying , She is going to the Grave , that she may weep there .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.909

Therefore when Mary was come where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell at
his Feet , saying to him , Lord , if Thou hadst been here , my Brother
would not have died . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.910

When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews weeping who came
with her ; he was grieved in Spirit , and affected with Trouble .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.911

At length he asked , Where have you laid him ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.912

They say to him , Lord , come , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.913

and see . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.914

Jesus shed tears . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.915

Therefore the Jews said , Lo how he loved him !
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.916

And some of them said , Could not he who opened the Eyes of one blind ,
have caused that he also should not have died ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.917

Jesus therefore again being grieved in himself , comes to the Grave ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.918

now it was a Cave , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.919

and a Stone lay upon it . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.920

Says Jesus , Take up the Stone . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.921

Martha , the Sister of him who was dead , represents to him , Lord , he
has a scent already , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.922

for it is four Days . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.923

<P_11,40J>

Jesus answers her , Did not I tell thee , that if thou wouldest believe
, thou shouldest see the Glory of God ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.925

Therefore they took up the Stone where the Dead was laid ; at which
Jesus looked up above , and said ; Father , I give thee thanks , that
thou hast hearkened to me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.926

Yet I knew that Thou always hearkenest to me ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.927

but by reason of the Company standing about I spoke , in order for them
to believe that Thou hast sent me . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.928

And having said these Things , he cried out aloud , Lazarus , come forth
. Whereupon he who was dead came out , bound Feet and Hands with the
Grave cloaths , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.929

and his Face was bound about with a Napkin .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.930

Jesus says to them , Let him loose , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.931

and give <font> him <$$font> liberty to go .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.932

Many of the Jews therefore who came to Mary , and had seen the Things
which Jesus did , believed in him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.933

Some of them notwithstanding went away to the Pharisees ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.934

and told them what Things Jesus had done . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.935

Therefore the chief Priests and Pharisees gathered together the Council
, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.936

and said ; What do we ? PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.937

since this Man does many Miracles . If we let him alone thus , all will
believe in him ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.938

nay the Romans will come , and take away both our Place and Nation .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.939

Besides Caiaphas a certain one of them , being high Priest that Year ,
said to them ; You know not any Thing , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.940

Nor consider , that it is profitable to us , that one Man should die for
the People , and not the whole Nation perish .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.941

Nevertheless he did not say this of himself ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.942

but being high Priest that Year , he prophesied that Jesus should die
for the Nation ; And not for the Nation only , but that he would also
gather together into one , the Children of God who were dispersed .
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.943

From that Day therefore they consulted together , that they might put
him to death . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.944

Therefore Jesus no more walked publickly among the Jews ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.945

but went away thence into a Country near the Wilderness , to a City
called Ephraim ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.946

and there he abode with his Disciples . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.947

The Passover of the Jews too was near ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.948

and many went up to Jerusalem from the Country before the Passover ,
that they might purify themselves . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.949

They therefore sought for Jesus , PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.950

and talked with one another standing in the Temple ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.951

What do ye think , that he will not come at all to the Feast ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.952

Now both the chief Priests and Pharisees had given Commandment , that if
any one knew where he was , he should declare <font> it <$$font> , that
they might apprehend him . PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.953
