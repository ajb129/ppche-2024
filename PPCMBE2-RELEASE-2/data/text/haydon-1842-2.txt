<font> January 1 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.5

O God , bless the beginning , progression , & conclusion of this year to
my family , my Art , my Country , & myself . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.6

Amen . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.7

Went to the Gallery HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.8

& found the Duke's head in admirable order . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.9

There is nothing enrages mankind so much as the perception of their real
motives under disguise . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.10

Let it , youth , when it <font> perceives , <$$font> be <font> silent
<$$font> - but act on the conviction - confide in no one -
HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.11

accusations will follow of injustice , or suspicions of morbid view .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.12

I have always been right in my perception of the motives of others ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.13

and if I acted & not talked , or been too fond to prove to others my
sagacity , my acuteness would have advanced my interests .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.14

The Duke's head was painted very red & pearly , then glazed with yellow
lake & rubbed off when tacky , then glazed with orpiment in the Shadows
, which subdued the red . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.15

Ultramarine was touched in to cool & keep down the shadows till the
whole had the effect of glowing Sun light , HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.16

but alas , poor head , if ever a cleaner touches it .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.17

The vehicle of glazing was margylp , equal quantities of drying oil , &
Varnish - mastic - Brown's & my own . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.18

<font> January 2 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.19

Sunday . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.20

Went to Hanover Square . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.21

Heard Dean of Carlisle , who is always earnest . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.22

Evans called , who made distemper copies for Nash of the Loggie ;
HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.23

he told me many useful things of Fresco . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.24

1st . Raphael's heads are impastoed like oil . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.25

2. Tints are mixed . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.26

3. It is not perpetual glazing . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.27

4. Lights in Raphael's foreheads are loaded . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.28

5. Fresco never extinct in Italy . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.29

Always practised . HAYDON-1842-2,5,115.30

<P_5,116>

6. Students given a lunette in the Vatican to paint after they have got
a Medal . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.32

7. Benvenuti mixed pots of tints , as I do in oil on my palette .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.33

<font> January 3 and 4 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.34

Went to the Adelphi , HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.35

& looked at Barry's Pictures . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.36

Miss Corkings , the Housekeeper , was a girl of 12 years old when Barry
painted the work . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.37

She told me many anecdotes . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.38

She said his Violence was dreadful , his oaths horrid , & his temper
like insanity . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.39

She said he carried Virtue to a Vice . His hatred of obligation was
such he would accept nothing . Wherever he dined he left 1@ @s. 2@ @d.
in the plate , and that Gentlemen indulged him . The servants were
afraid to go near him ; that in Summer he came to work at 5 , & worked
till dark , when a lamp was lighted , & he went on etching till XI at
night . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.40

She said , when coaxed to talk , his conversation was sublime .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.41

She thought the want of early discipline was the cause of his defects .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.42

He began to work in 1780 , HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.43

and was 7 years before he concluded it . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.44

She remembered Burke & Johnson calling once , but no Artist .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.45

She really believed he would have shot any one who would have dared .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.46

He had tea boiled in a quart pot , and a penny roll for breakfast ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.47

dined in porridge Island , HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.48

& had milk for supper , all of which was prepared in the rooms of the
House . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.49

There is a grasp of mind there no where else to be found , as Johnson
said , but no color , no surface , beauty , or correct drawing .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.50

Still , as the only work of the kind {TEXT:missing_"of_the_kind"} , it
is an honor to the Country . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.51

<font> January 5 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.52

Wrote some of my Life - but out on business . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.53

Did nothing but think . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.54

Saw head of Hopner's , and a head of Lawrence's in their first putting
in . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.55

Lawrence's mannered , & filthy in color - HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.56

Hopner pearly & pure - HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.57

the peach & pearl should be the guide . HAYDON-1842-2,5,116.58

<P_5,117>

<font> January 6 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.60

The obstructions in Fresco do not deserve the name of difficulties .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.61

They are useless & petty annoyances . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.62

It is a nuisance to have a color dry one thing when you mean it for
another . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.63

It is a nuisance to have a seam in the flesh , to have no depth in the
Shadow . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.64

It is a bore to copy your own Cartoon when the fire of invention is over
, & can never be recalled . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.65

If conquered , it is luck , not Art , or Science , or Skill .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.66

But I do not see why {TEXT:missing_"why"} they entitle Fresco to the
superiority over oil . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.67

The execution in the Louvre of the great Venetian Works there was quite
equal in power to any Fresco , & a_million times superior in tone .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.68

Called on Dyce , who is very amiable , HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.69

and had a valuable conversation . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.70

He said the Early Frescoes were stained drawings , leaving the ground
for the lights . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.71

After Giorgione the Impasto of oil was copied in Fresco ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.72

& that began the modern system of Raffael . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.73

Massaccio and Pinturrichio stained . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.74

I then saw Barry . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.75

He laid before me plans & sections , & the spaces where Pictures could
be introduced . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.76

He said nothing was fixed on . But as soon as the Committee met , the
first thing would be Fresco , or no Fresco , and that then he would
house Lime in two or three Vaults . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.77

He asked which Lime I liked best . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.78

I said chalk . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.79

He agreed with me . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.80

<font> January 7 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.81

Lectured on the Elgin Marbles at Mechanics . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.82

Wrote my memoirs - HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.83

hard . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.84

What a lesson they will be to young men ! HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.85

I said to Barry yesterday , " Shall I be employed ? "
HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.86

He replied , " Yes . " HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.87

" Is Eastlake my Friend ? " HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.88

" I do not know why he should not be . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.89

But he is a cold man ; HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.90

there is no knowing what he means . " HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.91

Barry promised sections & tracings to me . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.92

I fear the Spaces will not be enough for Fresco , the great beauty of
which is Light & Space . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.93

Oil & Fresco should not be mixed . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.94

Fresco will make oil look heavy , HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.95

& oil will make Fresco look mealy . HAYDON-1842-2,5,117.96

<P_5,118>

<font> January 8 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.98

Got the Duke's picture back to Gallery safe . HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.99

It looks excellently . HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.100

Blackwood said no Englishman could paint such a Picture as La Roche's
Charles . HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.101

I wrote Lord Francis HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.102

& told him I would undertake to beat it , if he would give me a
Commission , same size & same sort of subject . HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.103

He replies - {COM:editorial_material_omitted} HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.104

<font> January 9 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.105

I called on poor little Macdonald , Wilkie's early Patron & Friend ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.106

for he first gave him a Commission , in Eding-burgh , for the 1st
Village Politicians . HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.107

I found him ill & in poverty , with an early Picture of Wilkie's to sell
. HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.108

I promised to write Sir Robert Peel . HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.109

In coming home I met Macirone , the Picture of dirt , poverty , tobacco
, & schemes . HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.110

Poor fellow , I remember him just fresh from Naples , after Murat's
death , parading St. James Street , with light blue pantaloons & silver
lace - very handsome & a very interesting person .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.111

He has since deadened himself with Schemes , Revolutionary , Atheists ,
& rascals , HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.112

& never having any Religion , he has sunk from one thing to another ,
till he is now absolutely half his time without necessaries .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.113

He told me his Wife & 5 children & himself were all in one Room .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.114

" Take physic , Pomp . " HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.115

There certainly seems at this moment a general Conspiracy against
British Art , at the very moment it requires all encouragement .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.116

I suppose Foreigners at the bottom of it , who want a piece of the Cake
making . HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.117

When Englishmen go abroad , they not only lose their heart & feeling for
England , HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.118

but they lose their common perception . HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.119

Hezekiah was dying . HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.120

He prayed , with Tears , to live , HAYDON-1842-2,5,118.121

and 15 <P_5,119> years was added to his life . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.122

Therefore , prayer is available , HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.123

& can alter the apparent destiny of a Man . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.124

<font> January 10 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.125

Awoke " with a commission in the <font> Blues . <$$font> "
HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.126

Evil certainly has more power than good , HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.127

is a match for virtue , HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.128

and though it can@ @not overturn , it seems as if it maliciously <font>
baffled <$$font> the Almighty . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.129

<font> January 11 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.130

Wrote hard . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.131

Not painted yet . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.132

Saw Eastlake HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.133

& had a long conversation on Fresco - late discoveries of French
Chemists , &c. HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.134

We got rather interesting HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.135

& touched on " auld lang syne . " HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.136

Eastlake has Wilkie's timidity but none of his servility .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.137

I remarked this to him , HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.138

& he said Wilkie wanted to rise in the World , but <font> he <$$font>
did not . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.139

He was sorry indeed when his evidence was required .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.140

This was sincere . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.141

We then got on the prospects this occasion opened ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.142

and the Academician peeped out . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.143

He thought a paper should be drawn up , signed by me and others ,
stating our wish to paint in Fresco - . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.144

He thought <font> I <$$font> might write him and ask to be examined -
hem - & many other things worthy of him I@ @'ll put down <font> tomorrow
. <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.145

<font> January 12 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.146

Wrote hard my Lecture on Fresco for the Royal Institution .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.147

<font> January 13 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.148

No young man who is not independent should treat his superiors in rank ,
wealth , & station as if they were his equals . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.149

Men are all <font> equal <$$font> in the Eye of the Law & of God ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.150

but by the gifts of God Men are most <font> unequal . <$$font>
HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.151

Honesty , diligence , talent will accumulate wealth ;
HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.152

his children enjoy it ; HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.153

their honorable Station is entitled to deference ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.154

and even if ignorant , are entitled too to respectful expostulation , &
not sarcastic exposure . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.155

Such deference to Superiors in Age & Station is not servility , but
sense , HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.156

& proceeds from a just modesty in your own pretensions .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.157

I might have saved myself much pain had this been inculcated on me .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.158

I passed an hour & 1$$2 with Eastlake . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.159

It is extraordinary the eternal disposition of Academicians to see
nothing in my character but what is wrong . HAYDON-1842-2,5,119.160

It amounts to a <P_5,120> morbid insanity , HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.161

and is caused by the conscious conviction that all my calamities in Life
had arisen from their injustice . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.162

I press upon their imaginations , HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.163

and disturb their tranquillity ; HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.164

my name is never spoken of in their presence but a sneer follows !
HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.165

We talked of old Times . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.166

Whilst instructing Eastlake he had assisted me with 18 +L {TEXT:+L18} at
different times . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.167

In the turmoil that my ruin brought , calculating on his gratitude &
affection for so much time , so much anxiety , and so much attention
paid to him , & having boys to bring up , I have not <font> yet <$$font>
repaid it . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.168

Had I been just to myself , instead of being kind to {TEXT:missing_"to"}
others , I need not have had this sum of him ; HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.169

had I made his Father pay 200 gs. for the instruction I gave Charles ,
this would have been right . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.170

People never are charitable enough to think of my neglect of my own
interests . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.171

They dwell only on the result ; viz. , my incapacity to attend to the
interest of others . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.172

Is there any thing worse than not to pay a Tradesman ?
HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.173

Yes - <paren> I <font> did not <$$font> reply <$$paren> - to take half
price from a Duke , & never begin his Picture . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.174

This is the tone in Society adopted towards me , HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.175

and it is never told how many tradesmen I have paid off since my
troubles - of the dividends I have divided on the receipt of any large
sum . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.176

It is shocking ! HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.177

Whilst the Academy exists as the <font> Royal <$$font> Institution ,
whilst the President is by right Trustee of the Musaeum & National
Gallery , their influence will ever be in opposition to any plan which
will endanger their supremacy , HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.178

and no plan , however beneficial , can ever be adopted or ever will be ,
which , by giving a chance to the Genius of the people , will place
their portrait iniquity on the right ground . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.179

This scheme of Fresco will end in air , by their insinuations .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.180

" How many wish to paint in Fresco ? " said Eastlake .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.181

It is not what the Artists <font> wish . <$$font>
HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.182

It is what the State <font> wants ! <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.183

That is the Question . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.184

If the Academy was reduced by the Queen taking her name from it , if it
took its chance with all other Institutions , & kept its superiority
only by its talents , then we should soon see how long it would hold up
its head . HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.185

The great Farce of the Season is the Academy dinner .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,120.186

<P_5,121>

In the Press , now , I have hardly a Friend , except the Chronicle &
Spectator . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.188

I have only to shew a work to set the whole Press in an uproar of abuse
. HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.189

I attribute this entirely to the Students of the last 25 years who
{TEXT:missing_"who"} have grown up with Literary men of their own age ;
HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.190

and the general tone the Students imbibed at the Academy , as a pupil
told me , was to consider me a Monster . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.191

Their Literary Friends have issued out to their duties as reporters or
Critics , as Editors or Purveyors , HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.192

& the moment Haydon comes before them , he is denounced before the pen
is dipped in Ink . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.193

The last picture I exhibited was the Sampson . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.194

All the sound principles of its composition , its color , its story ,
its drawing , its light & Shadow were utterly unseen , & the Picture
held up as an abortion not to be tolerated . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.195

Had the Student gone to it with Modesty , & tried to find out what is
good , his mind , his practice , & his hand would have been improved .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.196

The object was clear - HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.197

I was beginning to get Commissions in the Country ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.198

and the Christians hoped to put a stop to them .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.199

They boasted , in fact , they would do so . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.200

All the principles I have advocated for 38 years are now beginning to
bud . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.201

They know I have been the most prominent Man , HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.202

& they can@ @not bear to dwell on the fact that , when they blow into
flower , the credit of watering the plant through Frost & Snow , & Wind
& Rain , belongs to Haydon . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.203

Many years ago , on my knees , in an agony of Pain , I prayed I might
live to see the great principles of Art acknowledged .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.204

I cared not for tasting their fruits - & that I might not leave the
World with the talents with which God had blessed me {TEXT:missing_"me"}
, cruelly ruined or wasted . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.205

Perhaps I shall be taken at my word . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.206

Thy will , not mine , be done ! HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.207

Amen . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.208

Certainly I have no feeling of animosity . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.209

God forgive Shee , Phillips , & Howard , whose cruelty & injustice was
the basis of all the Misfortunes of my Life . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.210

Peace to them . HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.211

<font> January 23 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.212

Poor Dr. Shuttleworth is dead ! HAYDON-1842-2,5,121.213

The object of his <P_5,122> whole life was to be a Bishop .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.214

He gets it , HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.215

leaves New College , where he enjoyed every comfort ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.216

& dies in 6 months . HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.217

Sic transit , &c. HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.218

Languid today - HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.219

poured forth yesterday . HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.220

<font> January 14 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.221

Sallied out to see a Man <paren> Macironi <$$paren> whom I had known in
full blossom 26 years ago , now in abject poverty .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.222

I found him in one small room , with 4 fine girls & a Wife .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.223

I brought 15 <slash> HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.224

& promised him more . HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.225

He had been a desperate Radical , HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.226

but I believe him a Man of honor ; HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.227

he has been an infidel - HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.228

I hope adversity will cure him . HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.229

In spite of this , he has great talent , courage , spirit ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.230

& is a relic of that race Napoleon formed with more honor .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.231

He wrote me a dreadful letter , which affected us all .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.232

Came home easier to find him with a breakfast to eat , poor fellow .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.233

My mind teems now with Pictures . HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.234

I shall be at the Picture Monday . HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.235

<font> January 15 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.236

Half the month gone , wholly occupied in lecturing & writing a new
Lecture on Fresco , for the Royal Institution . HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.237

After my mind exhausts itself in one direction , it flies off in another
. HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.238

I seized chalk all of a sudden as I was writing ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.239

& placed the leg & thigh of the Angel Gabriel rightly ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.240

& immediately my mind teemed with thoughts of new subjects .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.241

Went to the National Gallery , HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.242

& came back disgusted with the horny , oily , heavy , dull look of the
finest works after Fresco . HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.243

" In the Lord I put my trust . HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.244

How say ye , my Soul ? HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.245

Flee as a Bird to the Mountain . " HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.246

<font> January 17 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.247

My soul begins to yearn for something else . HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.248

My attempt in Fresco has opened my eyes so completely to a power I knew
nothing of , that all Art here palls on my senses .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.249

Great & good & merciful Creator , spare me till I have realized what I
now foresee I can do ! HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.250

Amen . HAYDON-1842-2,5,122.251

<P_5,123>

I am without Employment . HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.253

Save me from Difficulty , & my family from distress .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.254

Bless my boys , my daughter , my dear Mary . HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.255

Amen . HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.256

I dreamt I was in the Vatican last night & could not find Raphael's
works ! HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.257

Lectured at the London Institution - a very comfortable place .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.258

Spent the day in drawing my next Fresco . HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.259

<font> January 18 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.260

Lectured at Islington - my mind lax & dull . HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.261

<font> January 19 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.262

You take what they did from <font> Ignorance <$$font> -
HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.263

& establish it as a <font> principle . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.264

If a Man be exalted by reason of any excellence in his Soul , he may
please to remember , <font> that all souls are equal ; <$$font> and
their <font> different operations <$$font> are because the instrument is
a <font> better tune , <$$font> their <font> body <$$font> is more
<font> healthful , <$$font> or better <font> tempered <$$font> - which
is no more praise to him than it is that he was born in Italy . Jeremy
Taylor . 87 . On humility . Vol. IV . HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.265

This has been my surmise always . HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.266

How then are souls to be punished when the crimes they commit are owing
to the instrument <paren> the body <$$paren> not being in good tune ?
HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.267

In fact , a bit of buttered toast , as in Castlereagh's case , so
deranged the Instrument , that the <font> Soul <$$font> could not stop
the body cutting its <font> throat ! <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.268

Was the Soul justly punished , for the indigestion of its instrument ?
HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.269

If all Souls be equal & the body is the <font> cause of Sin , <$$font>
by being out of Tune , it is the body which is the cause of the
inequality of conduct between the Soul & the Body -
HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.270

and why must the Soul be damned or not because an obstruction to
physical health deranges the Brain , the physical organ of the Brain ?
HAYDON-1842-2,5,123.271

<P_5,124>

<font> January 20 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.273

What a singular state of mind is engendered by Idleness , when the Brain
is active - HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.274

like the Stomach , it preys on itself for want of food .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.275

How can Souls be equal , when some conquer the derangements of their
instrument , the body , & some the derangements will conquer ?
HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.276

No , no . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.277

They are not equal , though the responsibility of Soul & Body are not
the same . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.278

The Deity will not punish the Soul for the derangements of the Body ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.279

but will punish the Soul for being conquered by the Body .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.280

All Souls can@ @not be equal . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.281

We are told it is sinful to be conquered by the Body !
HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.282

Some Souls are - HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.283

some are not . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.284

If all Souls are equal , why should any be punished & some be rewarded ?
HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.285

Nonsense . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.286

All Souls are not equal , HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.287

and it is the power of the body or of the Soul which makes up the
character of human Soul & Body . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.288

Isaiah , XLIII , Verse 11 . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.289

" Beside me there is no Saviour . " HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.290

This is extraordinary . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.291

There is no desire in the English for " High Art . "
HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.292

Fresco being immovable , is no <font> property , <$$font>
HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.293

and the Commercial feeling connected with the Aristocratical renders
them insensible to any feeling for any characters higher than themselves
. HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.294

I am very discontented all of a sudden , HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.295

& can@ @not tell why . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.296

Altered my sketch , George IV & Duke , to Gurwood's wishes .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.297

It is the agony of ungratified Ambition - HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.298

that is the reason . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.299

I could execute now a series of fresco foreshortenings with terrific
power . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.300

Why do@ @n't ye ? HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.301

No money ! HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.302

<font> January 21 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.303

Sat my palette . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.304

Then came a " darkness visible , " which lasted all day - and nothing
but sketch . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.305

Eastlake shall be my safety valve . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.306

I told him he & Sir Robert would be baffled by the Portrait influence ,
& that Fresco would be turned to the right about , & that the people ,
at last , disgusted with being the ridicule of the Continent for want of
talent , would spontaneously get rid of the nuisance .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.307

The above is his reply . HAYDON-1842-2,5,124.308

{COM:editorial_material_omitted}

<P_5,125>

As the time approaches , the cowards shrink from Fresco .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.311

I@ @'ll give it to them if they do . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.312

I shall make it a strong point against them ; HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.313

but for the present , as Eastlake says , " Mum . "
HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.314

My large canvas is home , & up tomorrow . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.315

There is nothing like a large Canvas . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.316

Let me be penniless , helpless , hungry , thirsty , croaking , or fierce
, the blank , even space of a large Canvas restores me to happiness , to
anticipations of glory , difficulty , danger , ruin , or Victory !
HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.317

My heart expands , HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.318

& I did stride my room like a Hercules ! HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.319

God bless me through it . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.320

Amen . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.321

Three commissions are deferred , HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.322

& I am again left penniless for the present , HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.323

but I despair not . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.324

He who has carried me through so many trials will carry me gloriously
through this . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.325

I know it , HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.326

I feel it , HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.327

& rejoice at the Trial . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.328

I glory in being tried . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.329

Amen . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.330

<font> January 22 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.331

Wrote my Life all day . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.336

Did not go to church . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.337

Eastlake called . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.338

Hall of Athenaeum called . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.339

Eastlake was kind & affectionate , HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.340

& begged me to be <font> Quiet . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.341

He said all my Friends were in alarm , as it was a great moment in my
life ! HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.342

I told him he need not fear . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.343

Oh Almighty God , it is now 30 years since I commenced my Picture of
Solomon ; HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.345

though deserted by the World , my Family , Father , Friends , thou
knowest well I trusted in thee ; that thou didst inspire my spirit with
a fiery confidence ; that thou didst whisper me to endure " as seeing
one who was invisible . " HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.346

Thou knowest I never doubted , though without money , though in debt ,
though oppressed . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.347

I prayed for thy blessing on my commencing labours .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.348

Thou carriedst me through to Victory , & triumph , & extrication .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.349

I am this moment going to begin a grand work of Alexander & the Lion .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.350

Bless its Commencement , progression , & conclusion as thou blessedst
Solomon . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.351

Grant , in spite of whatever obstruction , I may bring it to a grand &
triumphant conclusion . HAYDON-1842-2,5,125.352

Spare <P_5,126> my intellect , my Eyes , my health , my head , my
strength . HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.353

Confirm my piety , HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.354

& grant , O Lord , that this work may advance the feeling of my great
Country for High & moral Art , & that I may not be taken from my great
Country till it be on a firm foundation , never to recede , & that I may
realize all my Imagination hoped in my Early Youth , for Jesus Christ's
sake . HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.355

Amen , with all my Soul . HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.356

One minute to 10 - HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.357

I begin , with the same elasticity of Spirit as 30 years ago .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.358

O God bless my labors . HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.359

Amen . HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.360

The Picture is divided in 4 parts in chalk . HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.361

Alexander is rubbed in , HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.363

God be thanked . HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.364

It is extraordinary the elasticity of mind with {TEXT:missing_"with"}
which I dashed it in - HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.365

though 3 Commissions are deferred till next year & I have not 2 +L
{TEXT:+L2} in the world in money - yet in God I trust for blessing &

and let me by this day twelvemonth be able to say I am more worthy

Lord Brougham called HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.374

& looked extremely well . HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.375

He called about a poor Man he had helped , HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.376

but told me it was useless <paren> as I had written for more help for
him <$$paren> , having given him myself 15 <slash> - , 3 <slash> , & 1

Lord Brougham said he had given him more than 100 +L {TEXT:+L100} -
HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.378

he has four daughters and a wife - HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.379

it is quite dreadful . HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.380

The subject of Alexander is not in Plutarch . HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.381

The mysterious influence under which I always begin a great work , is
hardly to be credited , under all circumstances of necessity .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,126.386

Here was I with hardly money for the week - with commissions deferred -
with a boy at Cambridge , in want of money I could not send him , & a
boy on board the Vindictive still owed three pounds of the quarter
<paren> 10 +L {TEXT:+L10} <$$paren> - seized at day break with an
irresistible impulse - a whisper audible , <P_5,127> loud , startling ,
- to begin a great work . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.387

The Canvas was lying at the Colorman's to be kept till paid for .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.388

I could not pay . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.389

I wrote him HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.390

& offered a bill at 6 months . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.391

He consented ; HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.392

the Canvas comes home , HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.393

& after prayer , ardent & Sincere , I fly at it ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.394

& get the whole in , capitally arranged , in two days , about 12 hours'
work , owing to the Time of year . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.395

Good & merciful God , am I not reserved for great things ?
HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.396

Surely I am . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.397

Surely at 56 to be more active than at 26 is extraordinary !
HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.398

Continue Thy blessings , HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.399

& grant I may finish both Alexander & the Curtius , & raise my Country's

My dear Boy Fred very nearly lost in Vindictive ,
HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.408

but he got off . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.409

He wrote me a capital short letter , which amused my Friends at the
Admiralty . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.410

This week I have rubbed in Alexander & Curtius .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.411

Sir Robert Peel said to me once he thought subjects of <font> one
<$$font> figure were always most effective . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.412

This was a sensible remark . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.413

<font> January 31 . <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.414

The last day of the Month . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.415

Wrote a lecture on Fresco . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.416

Rubbed in Alexander & the Lion & Curtius , HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.417

lectured a good {COM:sic} - HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.418

but no solid finishing work . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.419

On the whole not Idle , which I never can be , but not furiously at work
. HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.420

Made the requisite alterations in Curtius , HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.421

& so lay them both aside till my engagements are over .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.422

Called on Bailey . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.423

He said the Queen told him she wondered Sir David Wilkie painted
Portraits . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.424

" He ca@ @n't do it . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.425

I dare@ @say he thinks me rude , HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.426

but I never will sit to him again ! " HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.427

This is exactly as I thought . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.428

He says when the Queen comes in , Hayter bows to the ground 3 or 4 times
, & retires with the greatest humility ! HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.429

He did a bust of Albert . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.430

It was sent for for a party , & sent back , saying it was not liked .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.431

Bayley said they measured Albert & then the bust , & wished to alter it
to a German one . HAYDON-1842-2,5,127.432

Bailey <P_5,128> sent word if such was the art which pleased her Majesty
, he found it was beyond his talents . HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.433

Bailey & I are very old Friends . HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.434

When I was going , he said , " Will you dine on Wednesday with us ?
HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.435

Pickersgill is coming . " HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.436

" Yes , " said I . HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.437

So now I shall meet these fellows after 30 years .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.438

I@ @'ll give a Toast after dinner , " The Royal Academy , the only body

Amen . HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.444

Sluggish - always after lecturing . HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.445

I really am tired of lecturing . HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.446

Nothing but the wants of my boys induce me . HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.447

When I am in that infernal humor , I feel disposed to stand still ,
think of nothing , do nothing , see nothing , speak nothing , hear
nothing , & listen to nothing for hours . HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.448

It is a sort of Catalepsy of brain . HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.449

Lord Melbourne was dining where Eastlake was present , when after dinner
as Lord Melbourne was <font> roosting , <$$font> as Caroline Norton used
to say , they began to discuss " Fresco . " HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.450

They thought he was asleep , when suddenly he said , " Which is lightest
? " HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.451

" Fresco , my Lord . " HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.452

" Then dam@ @me , I@ @'m for Fresco , " said Lord Melbourne .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,128.453

This is true human life . HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.476

Worked hard , HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.487

& painted hands right heartily from Nature , better than I ever did .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.488

When we were young <paren> Wilkie and I <$$paren> , after such a day of
hands we should have had long discussions , holding the Candle close ,
looking in , talking of touches , surface , tones - how to touch in , &
take a body at the right time - and then drink tea with all our Souls .

These were days of real delight . HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.490

Went to Sir Robert Peel's . HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.501

Staid an hour HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.502

& studied his exquisite Collection . HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.503

In the Reynolds room there was a small Picture of E. Landseer's , in
his detailed & finished Style , which was a singular contrast to the
broad masculine head of Johnson , & the rich power of the snake in the
grass , by Sir Joshua . HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.504

Landseer is the Lawrence of Dog painters , with all his vice .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.505

He has no Eye for color - <font> none , <$$font> HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.506

& by the side of Reynolds , it was hideously palpable .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.507

I never was so struck with it . HAYDON-1842-2,5,129.508

<P_5,131>

Sir Robert had left me all three rooms to go through ,

& I enjoyed a treat . HAYDON-1842-2,5,131.511

I measured the Duke HAYDON-1842-2,5,131.512

& found him 6 <font> feet <$$font> high , the same height as <font> my

So much for the exaggeration of the Press . HAYDON-1842-2,5,131.514

I think I have now nearly done all but the background of Poictiers .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,131.515

Came home HAYDON-1842-2,5,131.516

I read Prayers in discontent . HAYDON-1842-2,5,131.529

Went to Hackney to see & correct a Pupil HAYDON-1842-2,5,131.530

Rubbed the Sky entirely over with Mastic & raw oil boiled 8 hours ,

then glazed into it HAYDON-1842-2,5,132.547

& touched into it , HAYDON-1842-2,5,132.548

then scraped it off HAYDON-1842-2,5,132.549

& touched in again . HAYDON-1842-2,5,132.550

Proceed tomorrow on the other side , HAYDON-1842-2,5,132.551

and then glaze the whole over HAYDON-1842-2,5,132.552

& touch in again - Divinissimo . HAYDON-1842-2,5,132.553

Always do a background at once - or at least at <font> twice <$$font> of

Perhaps in a_hundred years hence hardly a Picture of Reynolds will be in

yet for such perfection of Color one would risk any thing .
HAYDON-1842-2,5,132.559

None of them have such background - neither Rubens , Titian , Vandyke ,

Corregio may . HAYDON-1842-2,5,132.561

There is a small Picture in Lord Westminster's collection of an Imitater

Success of happiness unalloyed is impossible . HAYDON-1842-2,5,133.599

" Let me endure as seeing one who is invisible . "

Poor dear Eastlake , he seemed bilious , harrassed , and as if he wanted

If he did , he received the balance due from Lord Audley , amounting to

Wakely ought to have been ashamed of himself the night before last to

bawdiness of a London Hospital . HAYDON-1842-2,5,142.984

It is as great an impossibility for Wakely to understand
{TEXT:missing_"to_understand"} how a Poet could kiss the tear drops from
the rosy cheeks of an innocent country girl without lifting her
petticoats as it is impossible for him to believe any Woman not a Whore
in London . HAYDON-1842-2,5,142.985

The greatest infliction on the pride of any Poet would be that his

The lead pencil & charcoal practice with or without Nature is weak &

and then Cornelius' retouching is detestable . HAYDON-1842-2,5,144.1044
