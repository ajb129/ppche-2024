<font> Tuesday , May <$$font> the 20th , OFFICER-1744-1,209.3

This Evening myself , the Carpenter , and Cooper , went on Board the St.
<font> Tubes <$$font> , one of the <font> Brazil <$$font> Ships ,
carrying twenty-eight Guns , <font> Theophilus Orego Ferrara <$$font>
Commander , bound for <font> Bahia <$$font> and <font> Lisbon .
<$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,209.4

The People left on Shore were , <font> John Jones <$$font> , Master's
Mate <font> John Snow <$$font> , ditto <font> Vincent Oakley <$$font> ,
Surgeon <font> John King <$$font> , Boatswain <font> Samuel Stook
<$$font> , Seaman <font> John Shoreham <$$font> , ditto <font> John
Pitman <$$font> , ditto <font> Job Barns <$$font> , ditto <font> Richard
East <$$font> , ditto <font> Richard Powell <$$font> , ditto
OFFICER-1744-1,209.5

<font> Wednesday <$$font> the 21st , OFFICER-1744-1,209.6

Early this Morning the Captain came on board ; OFFICER-1744-1,209.7

on seeing us , he <P_210> ask'd us , How we came on board without his
Leave ? OFFICER-1744-1,210.8

Notwithstanding he gave Leave to the Consul for our Passage , we ought
to have waited on him ashore . OFFICER-1744-1,210.9

There was on board the Ship a <font> Spanish <$$font> Don , a passenger
, who told the Captain no <font> Englishman <$$font> should go in the
same Ship with him ; therefore desired we might be turn'd ashore ;
OFFICER-1744-1,210.10

but the Captain insisted upon doing what he pleas'd aboard his own Ship
, OFFICER-1744-1,210.11

and would not comply with his Request . OFFICER-1744-1,210.12

The <font> Spanish <$$font> Don , when we came to converse with him ,
was very much mov'd with the Relation of our Misfortunes ;
OFFICER-1744-1,210.13

and said to us , though our Royal Masters , the Kings of <font> England
<$$font> and <font> Spain <$$font> , are at War , it was not our Fault ;
that we were now on board a neutral Ship belonging to a King who was a
Friend to both Nations ; that he would not look upon us as Enemies , but
do us all the Service he could . OFFICER-1744-1,210.14

He extoll'd the Conduct and Bravery of Admiral <font> Vernon <$$font> at
<font> Porto Bello <$$font> ; OFFICER-1744-1,210.15

but , above all , applauded him for his Humanity and generous Treatment
of his Enemies . OFFICER-1744-1,210.16

He made great Encomiums on the Magnificence of the <font> British
<$$font> Fleet , and the Boldness and Intrepidity of the Sailors ,
stiling the <font> English <$$font> the <font> Soldiers of the Sea
<$$font> . OFFICER-1744-1,210.17

He supplied us in our Passage not only with Provisions from his Table ,
but also with Wine and Brandy ; OFFICER-1744-1,210.18

and during the whole Voyage appear'd so different from an Enemy , that
he took all Opportunities of giving us Proofs of his Generosity and
Goodness . OFFICER-1744-1,210.19

<font> Friday <$$font> the 7th of <font> May <$$font> 1742 ,
OFFICER-1744-1,210.20

This Morning <P_211> anchor'd before the City of <font> Bahia <$$font> ,
OFFICER-1744-1,211.21

went on shore to the Vice-Roy , OFFICER-1744-1,211.22

shew'd him the Pass we had from the Governor of <font> Rio Janeiro
<$$font> ; OFFICER-1744-1,211.23

He told us the Pass was to dispatch us to <font> Lisbon <$$font> , and
that the first Ship which sail'd from hence would be the Ship we came in
; OFFICER-1744-1,211.24

we petition'd him for Provisions , acquainting him of our Reception at
<font> Rio Grand <$$font> , and <font> Rio Janeiro <$$font> , that we
had hitherto been supply'd at the Rate of eight Vintins each Man <font>
per <$$font> Day . OFFICER-1744-1,211.25

He refused supplying us with any Thing ; upon which I told him , we had
better been Prisoners to the King of <font> Spain <$$font> , who would
allow us Bread and Water , than in a Friend's Country to be starv'd .
OFFICER-1744-1,211.26

The Captain of the Ship we came in , hearing the Vice-Roy would not
supply us , was so kind as to go with us to him , acquainting him how we
were provided for at <font> Rio Janeiro <$$font> , and that he would
supply us himself , if he would sign an Account to satisfy the
Consul_General at <font> Lisbon <$$font> , so that he might be
reimburs'd . OFFICER-1744-1,211.27

The Vice-Roy answer'd , he had no Orders concerning the <font> English
<$$font> , that he had Letters from the King of <font> Portugal <$$font>
his Master to supply the <font> French <$$font> , but had no Orders
about any other Nation , and if he gave us any Thing , it must be out of
his own Pocket , OFFICER-1744-1,211.28

therefore he would not supply us : OFFICER-1744-1,211.29

The Captain then told him that we were Officers and Subjects to the King
of <font> England <$$font> , and in Distress ; that we did not want
great Matters , only barely enough to support Life ,
OFFICER-1744-1,211.30

and begg'd that he would allow but four Vintins per Day , being but half
the Sum hitherto <P_212> allow'd us . OFFICER-1744-1,212.31

The Captain's Intreaties avail'd nothing , the Vice-Roy continuing as
fix'd in his Resolution of giving us no Relief ; OFFICER-1744-1,212.32

I do@ @n't believe there ever was a worse Representative of Royalty upon
the Face of the Earth , than this Vice-Roy : OFFICER-1744-1,212.33

His Royal Master the King of <font> Portugal <$$font> is very well known
to have a grateful Affection for the <font> British <$$font> Nation
OFFICER-1744-1,212.34

<paren> nor can we believe he is so Frenchify'd as this Vice-Roy makes
him <$$paren> OFFICER-1744-1,212.35

his Deputy differs greatly from him , OFFICER-1744-1,212.36

he has given a Proof of his Aversion to the <font> English . <$$font>
OFFICER-1744-1,212.37

We think Persons in the Distress we were represented in to him , could
in no Part of the World , nay in an Enemy's Country , be treated with
more Barbarity than we were here ; OFFICER-1744-1,212.38

we work'd here for our Victuals , OFFICER-1744-1,212.39

and then could get but one Meal <font> per <$$font> Day , which was
Farina and Caravances . OFFICER-1744-1,212.40

Since our being here , we have been informed of one of his Majesty's
Ships with three Store-ships being arrived at <font> Rio Janeiro
<$$font> , supplied with Stores and Men for the Relief and Assistance of
the <font> Severn <$$font> and <font> Pearl <$$font> , <paren> which
were sail'd before in <font> January <$$font> last for <font> Barbados
{TEXT:Barbadoes} <$$paren> <$$font> and that our People were gone on
board of them , and bound for the <font> West_Indies . <$$font>
OFFICER-1744-1,212.41

Here is a very good Bay for Ships to ride in , with the Wind from the
E.S.E. to the Northward and Westward back to the S.W. and Wind to the
Southward , which blows in , and makes a very great Sea .
OFFICER-1744-1,212.42

At the East Side coming in , standeth <font> Point de Gloria <$$font> ,
where is a very large Fortification with a Tower in the midst ;
OFFICER-1744-1,212.43

from this Point the <P_213> Land rises gradually ; OFFICER-1744-1,213.44

about a League from hence is the City of <font> Bahia <$$font> ;
OFFICER-1744-1,213.45

it is surrounded with Fortifications , and equally capable of defending
it against any Attempts from the Sea or Land . OFFICER-1744-1,213.46

Provisions here of all kinds are excessive dear , especially Fish ,
OFFICER-1744-1,213.47

this we impute to the great Number of Whales that come into this Bay ,
even where the Ships lye at Anchor ; OFFICER-1744-1,213.48

the Whale Boats go off OFFICER-1744-1,213.49

and kill sometimes seven or eight Whales in a Day . The Flesh of which
is cut up in small Pieces , then brought to the Market-place , and sold
at the Rate of a Vintin <font> per <$$font> Pound ;
OFFICER-1744-1,213.50

it looks very much like coarse Beef , but inferior to it in Taste .
OFFICER-1744-1,213.51

The Whales here are not all equal in Size to the Whales in <font>
Greenland <$$font> , being not larger than the Grampus .
OFFICER-1744-1,213.52

After living here above four Months without any Relief from the Governor
or the Inhabitants , who behaved to us as if they were under a
Combination to starve us , we embark'd on Board the St. <font> Tubes
<$$font> with our good Friend the Captain who brought us from <font> Rio
Janeiro <$$font> ; OFFICER-1744-1,213.53

we sail'd from <font> Bahia <$$font> the 11th of <font> September
<$$font> for <font> Lisbon <$$font> , in Company with one of the King of
<font> Portugal <$$font> 's Ships of War , and two <font> East-India
<$$font> Ships ; OFFICER-1744-1,213.54

but the St. <font> Tubes <$$font> not being able to sail so well as the
other Ships , lost Sight of them the first Night .
OFFICER-1744-1,213.55

About 70 Leagues from the Westward of <font> Madeira <$$font> , we bent
a new Foresail ; OFFICER-1744-1,213.56

within two or three Days afterwards we had a very hard Gale of Wind ,
scudding under the Foresail , and no Danger happening <P_214> to the
Ship during this Gale . OFFICER-1744-1,214.57

When the Wind had ceas'd , and we had fair Weather , the Captain , after
the Evening Mass , made an Oration to the People , telling them that
their Deliverance from Danger in the last Gale of Wind , and that the
Ship though leaky making no more Water than before , was owing to their
Prayers to <font> Nuestra Senhora Boa Mortua <$$font> and her
Intercession . That in Gratitude they ought to make an Acknowledgment
{TEXT:Acnowlegment} to that Saint for standing their Friend in time of
Need . That he himself would shew an Example by giving the new Foresail
, which was bent to the Yard , to the Saint their Deliverer ;
OFFICER-1744-1,214.58

accordingly one of the Seamen went forward OFFICER-1744-1,214.59

and mark'd out these Words on the Sail , <font> Deal esta Trinckado pour
nostra Senhora Boa mortua <$$font> <paren> which is as much as to say
<$$paren> <font> I give this Foresail to our Saint the Deliverer from
Death . <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,214.60

The Sail and Money collected on this Occasion amounted to upwards of
twenty Moydores . OFFICER-1744-1,214.61

On <font> Monday <$$font> the 23d of <font> November <$$font> , in the
Latitude 39 : 17 : North , and Longitude 6 : 00 W. that Day at Noon the
Rock of <font> Lisbon <$$font> bearing S. by W. distant sixteen Leag.
we steer'd E.S.E. to make the Rock before Night .
OFFICER-1744-1,214.62

At four o'Clock it blew a very hard Gale , and right on the Shore ;
OFFICER-1744-1,214.63

the Ship lay to under a Foresail with her Head to the Southward ;
OFFICER-1744-1,214.64

at Six it blew a Storm , OFFICER-1744-1,214.65

the Foresail splitting , oblig'd us to keep her before the Wind , which
was running her right on the Shore . OFFICER-1744-1,214.66

The Ship was now given over for lost , OFFICER-1744-1,214.67

the People all fell to Prayers , OFFICER-1744-1,214.68

and cried out to <P_215> their Saints For Deliverance , offering all
they had in the World for their Lives ; OFFICER-1744-1,215.69

and yet at the same time neglected all Means to save themselves ;
OFFICER-1744-1,215.70

they left off pumping the Ship , though she was exceeding leaky .
OFFICER-1744-1,215.71

This Sort of Proceeding in time of Extremity is a thing unknown to our
<font> English <$$font> Seamen ; OFFICER-1744-1,215.72

in those Emergencies all Hands are employ'd for the Preservation of the
Ship and People , OFFICER-1744-1,215.73

and , if any of them fall upon their Knees , 't@ @is after the Danger is
over . OFFICER-1744-1,215.74

The Carpenter and myself could by no Means relish this Behaviour ,
OFFICER-1744-1,215.75

we begg'd the People for God's sake to go to the Pumps , telling them we
had a Chance to save our Lives , while we kept the Ship above Water ,
that we ought not to suffer the Ship to sink , while we could keep her
free . OFFICER-1744-1,215.76

The Captain and Officers hearing us pressing them so earnestly , left
off Prayers , OFFICER-1744-1,215.77

and intreated the Men to keep the Pumps going , OFFICER-1744-1,215.78

accordingly we went to pumping , OFFICER-1744-1,215.79

and preserved ourselves and the Ship : OFFICER-1744-1,215.80

In half an Hour afterwards the Wind shifted to the W.N.W.
OFFICER-1744-1,215.81

then the Ship lay South , which would clear the Course along Shore ;
OFFICER-1744-1,215.82

had the Wind not shifted , we must in an Hour's time have run the Ship
ashore . OFFICER-1744-1,215.83

This Deliverance , as well as the former , was owing to the Intercession
of <font> Nuestra Senhora Boa Mortua : <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,215.84

On this Occasion they collected fifty Moydores more ,
OFFICER-1744-1,215.85

and made this pious Resolution , that , when the Ship arrived safe at
<font> Lisbon <$$font> , the Foresail , which was split in the last Gale
of Wind , should be carried in Procession to the Church of this grand
Saint , and the Captain should make an Offering equal in <P_216> Value
to the Foresail , which was reckoned worth eighteen Moydores .
OFFICER-1744-1,216.86

On <font> Saturday <$$font> the 28th of <font> November <$$font> , we
arrived at <font> Lisbon <$$font> ; OFFICER-1744-1,216.87

and on the next Morning every Person who came in the Ship , <paren>
excepting the Carpenter , myself and the Cooper <$$paren> Officers ,
Passengers , the <font> Spanish <$$font> Don himself , and all the
People , Men and Boys , walked bare-footed , with the Fore_sail in
Procession , to the Church of <font> Neustra Senhora Boa Mortua <$$font>
the Weather at that Time being very cold , and the Church a good Mile
distant from the Landing-place . OFFICER-1744-1,216.88

We <font> Englishmen <$$font> , when we came ashore , went immediately
on the <font> Change . <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,216.89

I was pretty well known to some Gentlemen of the <font> English <$$font>
Factory . OFFICER-1744-1,216.90

When I informed them that we were three of the unfortunate People that
were cast away in the <font> Wager <$$font> , and that we came here in
one of the <font> Brazil <$$font> Ships , and wanted to embrace the
first Opportunity of going for <font> England <$$font> ; they told me ,
that the Lieutenant had been before us ; that he was gone home in the
Packet-Boat , and left us a very indifferent Character .
OFFICER-1744-1,216.91

Our Journal was read by several Gentlemen of the Factory , who treated
us , during our Stay at <font> Lisbon <$$font> , with exceeding Kindness
and Benevolence . OFFICER-1744-1,216.92

On the 20th of <font> December <$$font> , we embarked on board his
Majesty's Ship the <font> Stirling Castle <$$font> for <font> England :
<$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,216.93

Here we had again the Happiness of experiencing the Difference between a
<font> British <$$font> and a foreign Ship , particularly in regard to
Cleanliness , Accommodation , Diet , and Discipline .
OFFICER-1744-1,216.94

We met with nothing material <P_217> in our Passage ,
OFFICER-1744-1,217.95

and arrived at <font> Spithead <$$font> on the 21st of <font> January
<$$font> , 1742 - 3 . OFFICER-1744-1,217.96

In about a Fortnight's Time , by an Order from the Right Hon. the Lords
of the Admiralty , we were put on Shore , the Captain of the <font>
Sterling Castle <$$font> not caring to land us till their Lordships
Pleasure should be known . OFFICER-1744-1,217.97

We were to undergo an Examination before the whole Board ,
OFFICER-1744-1,217.98

but their Lordships thinking it would be too tedious , appointed three
Gentlemen , Commanders of Ships , Persons of distinguish'd Merit and
Honour , to enquire into the Affair ; OFFICER-1744-1,217.99

but it was afterwards order'd , that we should not be examin'd till the
Arrival of the Commodore or our Captain , OFFICER-1744-1,217.100

and it was also resolved , that not a Person of us should receive any
Wages , or be imploy'd in his Majesty's Service , till every Thing
relating to the <font> Wager <$$font> was more plain and conspicuous ;
OFFICER-1744-1,217.101

There was no Favour shewn in this Respect more to one than the other ,
so that every Body seem'd pleas'd with their Lordships Resolution .
OFFICER-1744-1,217.102

As to our Commander , Capt. <font> Cheap <$$font> , the Lords of the
Admiralty have receiv'd a Letter from him by the Way of <font> Lisbon
<$$font> , giving an Account that he was at a <font> Portuguese <$$font>
Settlement in <font> Chili <$$font> , where he had been well received by
the Governor , and was preparing to embark for <font> England <$$font>
the first Opportunity . OFFICER-1744-1,217.103

Here ends the Account of the <font> Wager <$$font> , which I am well
assured is a very faithful one , free from any Impartiality or Prejudice
, either to the Captain , Officers , or Crew . OFFICER-1744-1,217.104

As I have now finish'd this , I shall , according to my <P_218> Promise
, proceed with my Journal of the Commodore's Expedition , and begin
where I left off when we lost Sight of the <font> Wager <$$font> , being
the 19th . OFFICER-1744-1,218.105

Number of Rats were seen between Decks , as would appear incredible to

prodigious Degree , that they could scarce keep them from running over
their Victuals , during the Time they were at Dinner , and that they had
never seen so great a Number before this Day . OFFICER-1744-1,218.115

they likewise found the <font> Oakham <$$font> , wash'd out of the Whale
between Wind and Water ; on which they nailed a Piece of Lead over the
Place that was leaky . OFFICER-1744-1,218.121

The Ship's Company being still in a sick and <P_219> miserable Condition

Fresh Gales and squally with much Rain . OFFICER-1744-1,220.183

The Crew of the <font> Gloucester <$$font> are extreamly sickly , they
having very few capable of working the Ship ; OFFICER-1744-1,220.184

and what still adds to their unfortunate Condition is , the prodigious
Increase of Rats , which plague them to that degree , that they can get
no sleep ; OFFICER-1744-1,220.185

for they are no sooner laid down in their Hammocks , but immediately a
Swarm of these Vermin come running over them , and frequently <P_221>
give them sad Bites ; OFFICER-1744-1,221.186

nay , some of those who kept their Hammocks , and thro' the Force of
their Distemper , almost insensible of Pain , have had part of their
Toes eat off as they lay there ; OFFICER-1744-1,221.187

the Destruction and Deformity which these Vermin do make on the dead
Bodies , that lye about the Deck , <paren> they having at this Time ,
ten or a_dozen dying in a Day <$$paren> makes the most shocking
Spectacle that ever Man beheld , one having his Eyes eat out , another
his Cheeks eaten off , and others part of their Arms , Legs , <font> &c.

<font> Saturday <$$font> 16 . OFFICER-1744-1,221.189

Fresh Gales and hazey , OFFICER-1744-1,221.190

the latter moderate and cloudy with Rain . OFFICER-1744-1,221.191

This Day we saw the Land , OFFICER-1744-1,221.192

bore E.N.E. 10 Leagues distant ; OFFICER-1744-1,221.193

we imagined , according to our Reckoning , this to be the high Land of
the Island <font> Socora . <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,221.194

At three in the Morning it blowed so violently , that we lowered the
Mainyard , and took the third Reef in the Sails .
OFFICER-1744-1,221.195

At six in the Morning we saw the Northmost Land E. by N. and the
Southernmost S.E. half E. OFFICER-1744-1,221.196

the Land appeared like Islands of an indifferent Height ,
OFFICER-1744-1,221.197

the Northernmost we took to be <font> Narborough <$$font> 's Island ,
{TEXT:.} bearing then E. by N. 8 Leagues . OFFICER-1744-1,221.198

The Wind coming about , we wore Ship , OFFICER-1744-1,221.199

and stood to the Eastward , after a Consultation being held on Board ;
OFFICER-1744-1,221.200

it was apprehended not safe to steer near the Shore , the Ship's Company
being so very weak and ill , that they were not capable of working the
Ship ; OFFICER-1744-1,221.201

therefore we were resolved to <P_222> make the best of our Way to the
Island of <font> Juan Fernandez <$$font> , <paren> the Place appointed
for a general Rendezvouz {TEXT:Rendevouz} <$$paren> in order to recover
and refresh our Men , and refit our Sails and Rigging , which were in a
wretched Condition , our Shrouds and Chain-plates being broke ;
OFFICER-1744-1,222.202

nay , so great was the Sickness among the Men , and they rendered so
incapable thereby of performing their proper Duty , or working the Ship
, that even the Officers in the Ship were obliged to keep the Watch .
OFFICER-1744-1,222.203

<font> Sunday <$$font> , 17 . OFFICER-1744-1,222.204

We had hard Gales with violent squalms of Wind . OFFICER-1744-1,222.205

At 2 in the Morning the Forestay blew from the Stay ,
OFFICER-1744-1,222.206

and the violent Weather obliged us to bear away .
OFFICER-1744-1,222.207

Our Foresail split to pieces , OFFICER-1744-1,222.208

and in order to reef our other Sails , we brought to under a balanced
Mizen . OFFICER-1744-1,222.209

At 3 in the Morning we bent another Foresail OFFICER-1744-1,222.210

and set it ; OFFICER-1744-1,222.211

we were upwards of two Hours hawling the Mainyard up by the Captain ,
our Men being so very weak . OFFICER-1744-1,222.212

At Noon we saw several high cragged Mountains covered with Snow ,
OFFICER-1744-1,222.213

the last appeared from the Northwest to the Southeast .
OFFICER-1744-1,222.214

We found daily a great deal of Water in our Ballast , which occasioned
us a great deal of Trouble and Time to be spent to come at the fresh
Water for the Ship's Company , out of the little Stock of that precious
Commodity we had left ; OFFICER-1744-1,222.215

and sometimes it was almost impossible , the Ship being very leaky when
it blows ; OFFICER-1744-1,222.216

the Gunners Crew , the Carpenters Crew , the Boatswain and the Armourer
and their Crews all very ill . OFFICER-1744-1,222.217

A strong Current here set us to the Westward . OFFICER-1744-1,223.238

<font> Saturday <$$font> , 23 . OFFICER-1744-1,223.239

We had little Wind and calm for the first part , the middle and latter
hard Gales and squally , with a very great Sea and a violent Swell ,
which did a great deal of Damage to our Rigging and Sails ;
OFFICER-1744-1,223.240

we likewise shipped a very great Sea , the Ship being in a very
deplorable Condition for want of Sails , Yards and Water for the few Men
that <P_224> we had left . OFFICER-1744-1,224.241

We had not one Topsailyard in the Ship , nor a Carpenter well to repair
any of them . OFFICER-1744-1,224.242

To make a Shift with in our present Extremity , we bent a Spritsail for
a Foretopsail . OFFICER-1744-1,224.243

OFFICER-1744-1,224.244

This Day at 4 in the Afternoon saw the island of <font> Juan Fernandez
<$$font> , distant about 13 Leagues W. by S. OFFICER-1744-1,225.293

The Joy that appeared among our People at this Sight is inexpressible ,
OFFICER-1744-1,225.294

for our Ship <paren> as well as Men <$$paren> was in a deplorable
Condition . OFFICER-1744-1,225.295

<font> Tuesday <$$font> , 9 . OFFICER-1744-1,225.296

Fresh Gales and cloudy , with some showers of Rain , and a very great
Sea . OFFICER-1744-1,225.297

At Noon the Body of the Island <P_226> was distant about 4 Leagues .
OFFICER-1744-1,226.298

<font> Wednesday <$$font> , 10 . OFFICER-1744-1,226.299

The first part fresh Gales and cloudy with small Rains ,
OFFICER-1744-1,226.300

the middle and latter parts little Wind and cloudy .
OFFICER-1744-1,226.301

At 2 in the Afternoon we anchor'd in 20 Fathom Water , under the Land ,
at our long_wish'd_for Port <font> Juan Fernandez <$$font> ,
OFFICER-1744-1,226.302

and at 4 moor'd . OFFICER-1744-1,226.303

We were in a most deplorable Condition , not having 200 Men left out of
above 500 we brought from <font> England <$$font> , and most of those
scarce able to crawl along the Deck . OFFICER-1744-1,226.304

As soon as we had moor'd , we sent our Boats ashore with Spars and Sails
to make Tents for the Sick . OFFICER-1744-1,226.305

The Commodore assisted us in fixing them , OFFICER-1744-1,226.306

and cheer'd us with Necessaries from his own Stores .
OFFICER-1744-1,226.307

I take this Island to lie in Latitude 34 : 45 and about 120 Leagues from
the Main . OFFICER-1744-1,226.308

It is uninhabited . OFFICER-1744-1,226.309

It is about twelve Leagues round , with small pleasant Vallies , which ,
if manur'd , would probably bear Wheat , Peas , <font> &c. <$$font>
OFFICER-1744-1,226.310

The Sides of the Mountains are partly Woodlands , well_stock'd with
Timber fit for building , but not for Masts ; and partly Savannas , or
natural Meadows , which produce very fine Grass .
OFFICER-1744-1,226.311

There are but two Bays in the whole Island where Ships may anchor ,
OFFICER-1744-1,226.312

and these are at the E. End , in both of which is a Rivulet of fresh
Water ; OFFICER-1744-1,226.313

these Bays may be so fortified with little Charge , that fifty Men in
each , might be able to keep off a_thousand ; OFFICER-1744-1,226.314

and there is {TEXT:_s} no coming into these Bays from the W. End but
with great Difficulty , through narrow Passages over the Mountains ,
where if three <P_227> Men were placed , they may keep off as many
thousands from approaching them . OFFICER-1744-1,227.315

Here we found abundance of Goats , Dogs , Sea Lions , Seals , Bream ,
Cod , and Crawfish as big as a middling Lobster ; OFFICER-1744-1,227.316

we likewise found great Numbers of Roots much resembling our long sort
of Turneps , Cabbage-Trees , Water-Cresses , &c. which were of great
Service to us , and saved all our Lives . OFFICER-1744-1,227.317

We at first catch'd very few Goats , not knowing how to come at them ,
they taking Shelter upon the Mountains and amongst the Rocks for fear of
the Dogs ; OFFICER-1744-1,227.318

but after a while , finding that they always came out towards Night to
graze , we used to way-lay them , OFFICER-1744-1,227.319

and shot a great many , which with the Dogs that we also shot made a
delicious Entertainment . OFFICER-1744-1,227.320

The Sea Lions we kill'd chiefly for Harslets , which eat as fine as any
calf's pluck in the World ; OFFICER-1744-1,227.321

sometimes indeed we used to cut their Flesh into Stakes , and broil it ;
OFFICER-1744-1,227.322

it eats somewhat like a Beef-steak , OFFICER-1744-1,227.323

and is of the same Colour when dress'd . OFFICER-1744-1,227.324

The Reason why they are so call'd , as we imagine , is from their
roaring , which is very much like that of Land Lions , and in their
Heads also much resembling them ; OFFICER-1744-1,227.325

they have four large Teeth <P_228> before , OFFICER-1744-1,228.326

the rest thick , short and stubbed ; OFFICER-1744-1,228.327

their hind Parts are very different ; OFFICER-1744-1,228.328

they are very large , some of them being near twice the Bigness of a
Horse ; OFFICER-1744-1,228.329

they have four Fins ; OFFICER-1744-1,228.330

the two foremost , which are about half a Yard long , serve them , when
ashore , to stump along , drawing their hinder Part after them , the two
hindermost being only of use to them in the Water ;
OFFICER-1744-1,228.331

they have short Hair of a light Colour , but lighter when young than old
, OFFICER-1744-1,228.332

for when old they look more sandy ; OFFICER-1744-1,228.333

their Prey is all in the Water , their Food being Fish ,
OFFICER-1744-1,228.334

but being of an amphibious Kind , they generally come upon the Land to
sleep ; OFFICER-1744-1,228.335

five or six frequently come OFFICER-1744-1,228.336

and huddle together like Swine , OFFICER-1744-1,228.337

and lie so for two or three Days , if not molested ;
OFFICER-1744-1,228.338

they are very fat , OFFICER-1744-1,228.339

and produce a considerable Quantity of Oil , some of which we used in
our Lamps , and also in frying our Fish , it having no unpleasant Taste
. OFFICER-1744-1,228.340

They are very much afraid of a Man , OFFICER-1744-1,228.341

for as soon as they see him , or apprehend they are in Danger from any
thing near them , they immediately make to the Water ,
OFFICER-1744-1,228.342

<paren> for they never venture very far from it . <$$paren>
OFFICER-1744-1,228.343

Some of our People would frequently get on their Backs and ride them .
OFFICER-1744-1,228.344

If they are close pursued , they will frequently turn about and raise
their Body up with their Fore-fins , and face the Pursuer , standing
with their Mouths wide open upon their Guard . OFFICER-1744-1,228.345

One of our People was unfortunately torn to Pieces by them .
OFFICER-1744-1,228.346

Our Method of killing them when we wanted them to eat , or their Oil ,
was to clap a Pistol just to their Mouths as they stand <P_229> open ,
and so fire it down their Throats ; OFFICER-1744-1,229.347

but when we had a Mind to have some Diversion with them , which we
call'd <font> Lion bating <$$font> , then each of us took a Half pike in
his Hand , OFFICER-1744-1,229.348

and so prick'd them to Death , which commonly was sport for three or
four Hours before we kill'd them , OFFICER-1744-1,229.349

and oftentimes they would find us work enough ; OFFICER-1744-1,229.350

but they being heavy unweildy Creatures , and we assaulting them before
and behind , and all round , generally conquer'd them in the end ,
OFFICER-1744-1,229.351

yet they often would put us a little to the Scower ,
OFFICER-1744-1,229.352

and sometimes the Creature would run himself , OFFICER-1744-1,229.353

but knew not which way , OFFICER-1744-1,229.354

for we commonly got between the Water and him . OFFICER-1744-1,229.355

We kill'd one which was almost twenty-four Foot long , fifteen round ,
and seventeen Inches deep in Fat . OFFICER-1744-1,229.356

As to Seals , we did not eat many of them , judging them to be
unwholesome ; OFFICER-1744-1,229.357

they are almost as big as Calves ; OFFICER-1744-1,229.358

under each Shoulder grows a long thick Fin ; OFFICER-1744-1,229.359

these serve them to swim with when in the Sea , OFFICER-1744-1,229.360

and are instead of Legs to them , when on the Land ;
OFFICER-1744-1,229.361

for raising their Bodies up on end , by the Help of these Fins or Stumps
, and so having their Tail-parts drawn close under them , they rebound
as it were , OFFICER-1744-1,229.362

and throw their Bodies forward , drawing their hinder Parts after them ;
OFFICER-1744-1,229.363

and then again rising up , and springing forward with their fore Parts
alternately , they lie tumbling thus up and down , all the while they
are moving on Land . OFFICER-1744-1,229.364

From their Shoulders {TEXT:Soulders} to their Tails they grow tapering
like Fish , OFFICER-1744-1,229.365

and have two small Fins on each side the Rump , which is <P_230>
commonly covered with their Fins : OFFICER-1744-1,230.366

These Fins serve instead of a Tail in the Sea ; OFFICER-1744-1,230.367

and on Land they sit on them , when they give suck to their young .
OFFICER-1744-1,230.368

Their Hair is of divers Colours , as black , grey , dun , spotted ,
looking very sleek and pleasant when they come first out of the Sea .
OFFICER-1744-1,230.369

Here are always Thousands either sitting on the Bays , or going and
coming in the Sea round the Island , which is covered with them <paren>
as they lie at the Top of the Water playing and sunning themselves
<$$paren> for near a Mile from the Shore . OFFICER-1744-1,230.370

The young Seals are like Puppies , OFFICER-1744-1,230.371

and lie much ashore ; OFFICER-1744-1,230.372

but when beaten by any of us , they , as well as the old ones , will
make towards the Sea , and swim very swift and nimble ; tho' on Shore
they lie very sluggishly , OFFICER-1744-1,230.373

and will not go out of our ways unless we beat them , but snap at us .
OFFICER-1744-1,230.374

A Blow on the Nose soon kills them . OFFICER-1744-1,230.375

The Bream we used to fry , OFFICER-1744-1,230.376

and are pretty good eating , only very bony ; OFFICER-1744-1,230.377

they are about twenty Inches long , and from the top of their Backs to
the bottom of their Bellies eight Inches ; OFFICER-1744-1,230.378

they have five large Fins on the hinder Part of their Heads , and one
large one , reaching from the hindermost of them to their Tails ,
OFFICER-1744-1,230.379

they have two middling ones , one on each Side of their Gills , and one
large one stretching from the Middle of the Bottom of their Bellies to
their Tails , which is dented like a half Moon ; OFFICER-1744-1,230.380

they have large Eyes , wide Nostrils , and a small Mouth ;
OFFICER-1744-1,230.381

they are very thin , OFFICER-1744-1,230.382

and we called them Bream , because they nearest resembled that Sort of
Fish . OFFICER-1744-1,230.383

The <P_231> Cod we catch'd as fast as we could bait our Hooks ,
OFFICER-1744-1,231.384

and are very good eating ; OFFICER-1744-1,231.385

we likewise dried great Number , OFFICER-1744-1,231.386

and put them on board our Ship ; OFFICER-1744-1,231.387

they are about two Foot long , OFFICER-1744-1,231.388

and have small Scales about the Bigness of a Silver-penny ;
OFFICER-1744-1,231.389

they weigh about twelve Pounds , OFFICER-1744-1,231.390

and are so very fat that they may be eaten boil'd or fry'd without
Butter or Oil . OFFICER-1744-1,231.391

The Crawfish we made Broth of . OFFICER-1744-1,231.392

The Turneps and Cabbage Trees were of great Use to us , especially the
latter , the Fruit of which , tho' small , was very good and sweet .

The Body of the Tree is small and strait , and of a prodigious Length ,
<paren> some Trees being 70 or 80 Foot long <$$paren> with several Knots
or Joints , about four Inches from each other , without any Leaves
except at the Top , in the midst of which the Cabbage is contained ,
which when boiled is as good as any Garden Cabbage ;
OFFICER-1744-1,231.394

the Branches are commonly about twelve or thirteen Feet in length , and
about a Foot and an half from the Trunk of the Tree ;
OFFICER-1744-1,231.395

they shoot forth Leaves about four Foot long and an Inch and an half
broad , which grow so regularly , that the whole Branch seems but one
entire Leaf ; OFFICER-1744-1,231.396

the Cabbage when cut out from amongst the Bottoms of the Branches , is
commonly about six Inches round , and a Foot long ,
OFFICER-1744-1,231.397

and is as white as Milk . OFFICER-1744-1,231.398

At the Bottom of the Cabbage grow great Bunches of Berries , in Shape
like a Bunch of Grapes , and about six Pounds weight ,
OFFICER-1744-1,231.399

they are red , and about the Bigness of a large Cherry , with a large
Stone in the Middle , OFFICER-1744-1,231.400

<P_232>

and taste like <font> English <$$font> Haws . OFFICER-1744-1,232.402

The Method we used in getting the Cabbages , was not by climbing the
Trees , because they are so high , and have not any thing in the Bodies
to hold by , but by cutting them down . OFFICER-1744-1,232.403

There is a Sort of Fowl here , who are of a grey Colour , and about the
Bigness of a small Pullet , that work Boroughs in the Ground like a
Coney , and lodge in them in the Night , and go out to catch Fish in the
Day Time , OFFICER-1744-1,232.404

for they are of a quadruped kind , OFFICER-1744-1,232.405

and eat a little fishy OFFICER-1744-1,232.406

but after having been properly cooked they taste tolerable well .
OFFICER-1744-1,232.407

There are also some <font> Penguins <$$font> , and a little Bird a
considerable deal smaller than a Wren , that hath a Bill no bigger than
a common Pin , OFFICER-1744-1,232.408

his Legs are but small in Proportion to his Bulk ;
OFFICER-1744-1,232.409

his Feathers are very small , and mostly black ; OFFICER-1744-1,232.410

we seldom saw any of them unless towards Evening ,
OFFICER-1744-1,232.411

and then they would come humming about us : OFFICER-1744-1,232.412

But if we had a Fire in the Night , before the Morning we should have a
considerable Number of them fly into it . OFFICER-1744-1,232.413

<font> Thursday <$$font> , 11 . OFFICER-1744-1,232.414

The first and middle Parts little Wind and Calm , OFFICER-1744-1,232.415

the latter moderate and clear . OFFICER-1744-1,232.416

This Day arrived here the <font> Tryal <$$font> , in a most miserable
shatter'd Condition ; having buried above half her Crew since she left
<font> England . <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,232.417

Moderate Weather . OFFICER-1744-1,233.427

We now begin to find a great Alteration in our sick People , they
beginning to recover , which we impute to their eating Fish and Greens
in great Plenty ; those who have any Appetite , recovering in a short
time , but those who have none dying , their Disorder having gain'd too
much Ground upon them . OFFICER-1744-1,233.428

We observed that the Scurvy had very different Effects on us ;
OFFICER-1744-1,233.429

some were taken with a Shortness of Breath , OFFICER-1744-1,233.430

these were soon carried off ; OFFICER-1744-1,233.431

some quite lost their Senses . OFFICER-1744-1,233.432

others had their Sinews so contracted , that they lost the Use of their
Limbs . OFFICER-1744-1,233.435

Our Surgeon opened several that died , OFFICER-1744-1,233.436

black . OFFICER-1744-1,233.438

From this Time to the 27th , nothing remarkable happened .
OFFICER-1744-1,233.439

<font> Saturday <$$font> , 27 . OFFICER-1744-1,233.440

The Weather being very Fair , we saw a Sail , which proved to be the
<font> Gloucester <$$font> ; on which the Commodore order'd the Cutter
on Board , with the first Lieutenant , who carried with him some Fish
and Water , which was very acceptable , they being for some Time past at
the Allowance of only a Pint a Day ; OFFICER-1744-1,233.441

OFFICER-1744-1,235.485

<font> Friday <$$font> 17 . OFFICER-1744-1,235.486

This Day we lost Sight of her again , OFFICER-1744-1,235.496

and did not see her for three Days afterwards , during which Time , as
they informed us , she was driven to a little Island call'd <font>
Massafurro <$$font> , that lies in Latitude 35 : 55 S. and about 25
Leagues S.S.W. from <font> Juan Fernandez <$$font> , where <P_236> they
sent their Cutter ashore for Water ; OFFICER-1744-1,236.497

but she returned without being able to get at any , tho' they saw
several Streams ; the Wind blowing so strong on the Shore as caused a
great Surf {TEXT:Surff} that hinder'd their landing ;
OFFICER-1744-1,236.498

however they brought the Boat full of Fish . OFFICER-1744-1,236.499

<font> Thursday <$$font> , 23 . OFFICER-1744-1,236.500

Little Winds and cloudy . OFFICER-1744-1,236.501

The Commodore sent our Boat with the second Lieutenant to assist her in
mooring , her Crew not being able to do it , all their Men being sick

They had been ever since the 20th of <font> June <$$font> attempting to
make the Land {TEXT:Lnd} , OFFICER-1744-1,236.505

but the Squalls that blew from the Shore prevented them , though they
were sometimes within less than a Mile of it . OFFICER-1744-1,236.506

The Mortality on board this Ship raged more than in any other ,
OFFICER-1744-1,236.507

for since they left St. <font> Julian <$$font> 's , which was the 27th
of <font> April <$$font> , they had buried 254 Men ,
OFFICER-1744-1,236.508

and had but 98 Men and Boys now living , and most of them in a miserable
Condition . OFFICER-1744-1,236.509

When they first made the Island they had not Water to supply them for a
Week longer , at the Rate of a Pint a Day , which they had been reduced
to ever since the 21st of <font> May ; <$$font> so that had they not
reached the Island they must have inevitably perished .

if the other Ships , which we had parted with , were arrived there ;
OFFICER-1744-1,237.524

but in about half an Hour after she put out , she made a Signal of
Distress , on which we sent our Boats off to assist her , she being
driven with a strong Current , and the Wind blowing towards Land ,
almost on a Rock ; OFFICER-1744-1,237.525

accordingly they took her in tow , OFFICER-1744-1,237.526

and at 10 she anchored by us . OFFICER-1744-1,237.527

OFFICER-1744-1,238.542

<font> Sunday <$$font> , <font> September <$$font> 7 .
OFFICER-1744-1,238.543

At eight this Morning we saw a Sail in the Offing ,
OFFICER-1744-1,238.544

we had then our Top-masts stuck , OFFICER-1744-1,238.545

but immediately hoisted them , OFFICER-1744-1,238.546

bent our Sails , OFFICER-1744-1,238.547

and slipt our Cables , leaving Orders for the <font> Tryal <$$font> to
take Care and weigh them , OFFICER-1744-1,238.548

and gave her Chace ; OFFICER-1744-1,238.549

on the next Day we lost Sight of her , OFFICER-1744-1,238.550

but in a little Time after we saw another Sail , OFFICER-1744-1,238.551

and gave her Chace , OFFICER-1744-1,238.552

and came up with her OFFICER-1744-1,238.553

and took her ; OFFICER-1744-1,238.554

we brought her back to <font> Juan Fernandez <$$font> , where we arrived
on the Fourteenth . OFFICER-1744-1,238.555

When we came in we fired a Gun , which the <font> Gloucester <$$font>
answered . OFFICER-1744-1,238.556

The Capture was a <font> Spanish <$$font> Merchant ship call'd the
<font> Camella <$$font> , OFFICER-1744-1,238.557

and had on board between 30 and 40,000 <font> l. <$$font> in Money , a

. OFFICER-1744-1,238.558

<font> Thursday <$$font> , 17 . OFFICER-1744-1,238.559

We sent eight of the <font> Anne <$$font> {COM:sic_font_change} Pink's
Guns on board of the Prize and part of her Shot .
OFFICER-1744-1,238.560

<font> Friday <$$font> , 18 . OFFICER-1744-1,238.561

This Day the <font> Tryal <$$font> , having got in her Water and other

there to wait for our Arrival . OFFICER-1744-1,238.562

<font> Saturday <$$font> , 19 . OFFICER-1744-1,238.563

We put twenty_eight <font> Spanish <$$font> Prisoners from on board our
Ship into the <font> Gloucester <$$font> . OFFICER-1744-1,238.564

<P_239>

<font> Sunday <$$font> , 20 . OFFICER-1744-1,239.566

After leaving Orders for the <font> Gloucester <$$font> as soon as she
was re_fitted to follow us , and likewise for destroying the <font> Anne
<$$font> {COM:sic_font_change} Pink , she having been condemn'd <paren>
which , as we were informed was accordingly done , after having taken
her Masts out , and whatever else was thought necessary , on the
twenty_eighth of <font> September <$$font> , by towing her ashore , and
skuttling her , and afterwards setting her on Fire <$$paren> we and our
<font> Spanish <$$font> Prize sailed from the Island of <font> Juan
Fernandez <$$font> . OFFICER-1744-1,239.567

It was upon this Island that Captain <font> Sharpe <$$font> left a
<font> Moskito Indian <$$font> , in the Year 1681 , {TEXT:.} who
remained there three Years . OFFICER-1744-1,239.568

He had with him his Gun , a Knife , a small Barrel of Powder , and a few
Shot . OFFICER-1744-1,239.569

He chose for his Habitation a pleasant Valley , about half a Mile from
the Sea Coast , where he erected a very convenient Hut , and lin'd it
with Seal-skins , and made a Bed of the same , which served likewise for
his cloathing . OFFICER-1744-1,239.570

When his Powder and Shot were spent , he sawed his Gun Barrel into
several Pieces with his Knife , which he converted into a Saw by the
Help of a Flint ; OFFICER-1744-1,239.571

these Pieces he made into Harpoons , Lances , and Fishhooks ;
OFFICER-1744-1,239.572

and made himself with one of them another long Knife :
OFFICER-1744-1,239.573

This he did by heating the Pieces first in the Fire , and afterwards
working them on the Stones , which cost him abundance of Labour .
OFFICER-1744-1,239.574

With these he used to strike and kill the Goats and Fish for his
Subsistence , on which he lived pretty comfortably .
OFFICER-1744-1,239.575

He remained in this Condition on the Island until <font> March <$$font>
1684 , when he was delivered thence , <P_240> by some <font> English
<$$font> Ships which came there to careen . OFFICER-1744-1,240.576

When he first saw them at Sea , he guessed they were <font> English
<$$font> , OFFICER-1744-1,240.577

and being overjoyed with the Prospect , returned to his Hutt ,
OFFICER-1744-1,240.578

and went to cooking for their Reception ; OFFICER-1744-1,240.579

accordingly he dressed two Goats and a large Quantity of Cabbage for
their Entertainment ; OFFICER-1744-1,240.580

and what added greatly to his Joy and Pleasure was , that on their
coming ashore he found they were not only <font> English <$$font> , but
many of them his old Acquaintance , who were on Board the Ship which
left him there . OFFICER-1744-1,240.581

There was also left at this Island in the Year 1704 , one <font>
Alexander Selkirk <$$font> , a <font> Scotsman <$$font> ; the Reason of
which was a Difference between him and his Captain ;
OFFICER-1744-1,240.582

this , together with the Ship's being very leaky , made him at first
more willing to stay here , than proceed in the Voyage ;
OFFICER-1744-1,240.583

but he quickly alter'd his Sentiments , OFFICER-1744-1,240.584

and would gladly have return'd on board , which the Captain refused to
admit of . OFFICER-1744-1,240.585

He had with him his Cloaths and Bedding , with a Firelock , some Powder
, Bullets , and Tobacco , a Hatchet , a Knife , a Kettle , a Bible ,
some practical Books , and his mathematical Books and Instruments ;
OFFICER-1744-1,240.586

thus furnished he diverted and provided for himself as well as he could
. OFFICER-1744-1,240.587

He built two Huts with Pimento Trees , OFFICER-1744-1,240.588

and covered them with long Grass , OFFICER-1744-1,240.589

and lined them with the Skins of Goats , which he killed with his Gun ,
as long as his Powder lasted , which was not long , he having but a
Pound , OFFICER-1744-1,240.590

and when that was almost spent , he got Fire by rubbing two Sticks of
Pimento Wood together upon his <P_241> Knee . OFFICER-1744-1,241.591

In the lesser Hut , some Distance from the other , he dressed his
Victuals , OFFICER-1744-1,241.592

in the larger he slept , OFFICER-1744-1,241.593

and employed himself in reading , singing Psalms , and Praying .
OFFICER-1744-1,241.594

At first he never eat any Thing until Hunger constrained him , partly
for Grief , and partly for want of Bread and Salt ;
OFFICER-1744-1,241.595

nor did he go to Bed till he could watch no longer ;
OFFICER-1744-1,241.596

the Pimento Wood which burned very clear , served him both for Fire and
Candle . OFFICER-1744-1,241.597

He might have Fish enough , OFFICER-1744-1,241.598

but could not eat them for want of Salt , because they occasioned a
Looseness : except Crawfish , which he sometimes boil'd , and at other
Times broil'd , as he did also the Goats Flesh , of which he made good
Broth . OFFICER-1744-1,241.599

When his Powder failed him , he took the Goats by the Swiftness of his
Feet ; OFFICER-1744-1,241.600

for being in the Vigour of his Strength , about thirty Years of Age ,
and by his way of living , in continual Exercise of walking and running
, cleared of all gross Humours , so that he ran with wonderful Swiftness
thro' the Woods , and up the Rocks and Hills after them .
OFFICER-1744-1,241.601

His Agility in pursuing a Goat had like once to have been very fatal to
him , OFFICER-1744-1,241.602

for he followed it with so much Eagerness that he catched hold of it on
the Brink of a Precipice , of which he was not aware , the Bushes hiding
it from him , so that he fell with the Goat down a great Height , and
was so stunned and bruised with the Fall , that he narrowly escaped with
his Life ; OFFICER-1744-1,241.603

and when he came to his Sneses , he found the Goat dead under him .
OFFICER-1744-1,241.604

He lay there about twenty_four Hours , OFFICER-1744-1,241.605

and was scarce able to crawl to his <P_242> Hut , or to stir abroad
again in ten Days . OFFICER-1744-1,242.606

He came at last {TEXT:last,} to relish his Meat well enough without Salt
or Bread , OFFICER-1744-1,242.607

and had plenty of Turneps , and Cabbage from the Cabbage Trees ,
OFFICER-1744-1,242.608

and seasoned his Meat with the Fruit of the Pimento Trees , which is
much the same as <font> Jamaica <$$font> Pepper .
OFFICER-1744-1,242.609

He soon wore out all his Shoes and Cloaths by running in the Woods ,
OFFICER-1744-1,242.610

and at last being forced to shift without them , his Feet became so hard
that he ran every where without Difficulty . OFFICER-1744-1,242.611

He was at first much pestered with Cats and Rats which had bred in great
Numbers from some of each Species that had got ashore from Ships which
put in there to Wood and Water . OFFICER-1744-1,242.612

The Rats gnawed his Feet and Cloaths while asleep , which obliged him to
cherish his Cats with his Goats Flesh , whereby many of them became so
tame , that they would lie about him in great Numbers , and soon
delivered him from the Rats . OFFICER-1744-1,242.613

When his Cloaths were wore out , he made himself a coat and Cap of Goat
Skins , which he stitch'd together with Thongs of the same , and a
Needle made of a Nail sharpened upon the Stones ; OFFICER-1744-1,242.614

and some Shirts he made of some Linnen Cloth he had by him ,
OFFICER-1744-1,242.615

and stitch'd them with the Worsted of his old Stockings , which he
pulled out on Purpose . OFFICER-1744-1,242.616

In this Condition he remained four Years and four Months , till <font>
February <$$font> , 1709 , when some <font> English <$$font> Ships being
on that Coast in the Night , saw a Light on the Shore , which they
imagined to be some <font> French <$$font> Ships at anchor , with whom
they must either fight , or want Water <font> : <$$font>
OFFICER-1744-1,242.617

<P_243>

this filled them with various Apprehensions , OFFICER-1744-1,243.619

and one poor naked Man , passed in their Imaginations for a <font>
Spanish <$$font> Garrison , for a Body of <font> Frenchmen <$$font> , or
a Crew of Pyrates ; which all vanished in the Morning , when they found
it was the Fires made by this happy unhappy Man , whom they brought from
the Shore in his Cloathing of Goats Skins . OFFICER-1744-1,243.620

He had in great measure forgot his Language for want of Use .
OFFICER-1744-1,243.621

At his first coming on Board , they offered him a Dram ,
OFFICER-1744-1,243.622

but he refused it , having drank nothing but Water since his being on
the Island . OFFICER-1744-1,243.623

During his stay in this Place , there had several Ships passed by ,
OFFICER-1744-1,243.624

and but only two came to an Anchor , which were <font> Spaniards
<$$font> , who landed before he knew what they were ,
OFFICER-1744-1,243.625

and they came so near him , that he had much ado to escape ,
OFFICER-1744-1,243.626

for they not only shot at him , OFFICER-1744-1,243.627

but pursued him to the Top of a Tree , to the Foot of which they came ,
OFFICER-1744-1,243.628

and killed several Goats just by , OFFICER-1744-1,243.629

but went off without discovering him . OFFICER-1744-1,243.630

<font> Saturday <$$font> , <font> October 3 <$$font> .
OFFICER-1744-1,243.631

At one in the Afternoon , we saw two Sail , OFFICER-1744-1,243.632

and accordingly gave chace , OFFICER-1744-1,243.633

and came up with them , which prov'd to be the <font> Tryal <$$font> ,
and a Prize which she had taken during our separation .
OFFICER-1744-1,243.634

This Prize was called the <font> Arransaso <$$font> ,
OFFICER-1744-1,243.635

and had on board 606 <font> lb <$$font> Weight of Silver , and twelve
Pound weight of Gold , and two Chests of wrought Plate , being a set of
curious Plate lately purchased for a Church , with several costly Images
of <P_244> Saints finely wrought , and near two Foot long , which we
afterwards beat up close to make them lye snug in the Chests .
OFFICER-1744-1,244.636

The <font> Tryal <$$font> in chasing this Prize , having sprung her
Foremast and Mainmast , was condemned by the Commodore ,
OFFICER-1744-1,244.637

and the Prize , which she had taken , being a fine strong Vessel , and
fit for a Man of War , was commission'd by the Name of the <font> Tryal
<$$font> 's Prize , and the Crew of the former turn'd over into her .
OFFICER-1744-1,244.638

And , on <font> Sunday <$$font> , <font> October <$$font> 4 , {TEXT:.}
The <font> Tryal <$$font> was destroy'd , by scuttling her on each side
: OFFICER-1744-1,244.639

for if they had set her on Fire , they were afraid of alarming the Coast

We were now off the Island of <font> Lobos <$$font> , 6 Degrees 20
Minutes South Latitude ; OFFICER-1744-1,245.670

this Island at Sea appears of an indifferent height ;
OFFICER-1744-1,245.671

She was loaden with Planks and Iron . OFFICER-1744-1,246.693

The Captain of her had his Wife and two Daughters on Board , whom the
Commodore immediately ordered into our own Ship , to prevent any
Indecencies that possibly might be committed on the Women , and likewise
admitted them and the <font> Spanish <$$font> Captain to dine with him
every Day : which generous Treatment from an Enemy had such an Effect on
the <font> Spanish <$$font> Captain , that he informed the Commodore how
he might plunder the Town of <font> Payta <$$font> , which , tho' but a
small Town , was very rich ; and likewise offer'd to conduct his Men .
OFFICER-1744-1,246.694

our second <P_248> Lieutenant , who were to be back'd with our Ships in

and about 10 we entered the Harbour of <font> Payta <$$font> ,
undiscovered by the Fort and Vessels there , OFFICER-1744-1,248.744

and landed . OFFICER-1744-1,248.745

We were no sooner ashore , but some march'd , or rather run to the Fort
, shooting at every Person they met , which alarm'd the Fort ;
OFFICER-1744-1,248.746

and they , firing upon us with their small Arms , kill'd one Man
OFFICER-1744-1,248.747

and wounded seven . OFFICER-1744-1,248.748

But , however , that did not discourage us , OFFICER-1744-1,248.749

for we soon forc'd the Gates of the Fort , OFFICER-1744-1,248.750

they fired no more at us ; OFFICER-1744-1,248.752

hereupon we took Possession of it , OFFICER-1744-1,248.753

and hoisted <font> English <$$font> Colours ; during which Time , others
having attack'd the Governor's House , whereof they soon made themselves
Masters , alarm'd the whole Town ; OFFICER-1744-1,248.755

and the Inhabitants not expecting any such Visit , and taking them in
their first Sleep , were so terribly frighten'd , that they fled to the

their Beds were as warm as if they had that Moment got out of them ,
OFFICER-1744-1,248.757

and their Day Cloaths lay all about their Rooms .

our Tricks . OFFICER-1744-1,248.759
