My dear Sandys , Norfolk was obedient to your behest ,
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,754.18

and fattened and flavoured the Turkey , which arrived in state on
Christmas Eve , under chaplet of sausages . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,754.19

We attacked it two days following , drinking to the lord of Norfolk@ @'s
health , and wishing him with us . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,754.20

Sir William was absent , <P_2,755> having to play a match of Football at
Eastbourne , with Devonshire park ; MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.21

and there , by report this morning plainly worded , he got well licked .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.22

A swim in the Baths afterward braced him , for victory or another
drubbing . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.23

My wife and Marie Eveleen send you their warmest greetings .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.24

Accept mine , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.25

and present them to your circle . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.26

Our cottage offers few attractions in the pit of winter ,
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.27

but should a mad fit seize you , pray come hither
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.28

My dear Fred , I return you Mrs. Crawford's letter .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.42

It touches one with envy of her husband , of his children , and of her
friends . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.43

- I saw in Correspondence of the <font> Daily News <$$font> a
discernible outline of the Admiral dining at Clemenceau's .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.44

- From the Foreign point of view , our Government , in Foreign affairs ,
must appear a table of imbeciles . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.45

But Diplomacy that is not backed by force is a nerveless thing .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.46

Either we surrender our position universally , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,755.47

or we must have men in arms - soldiers as well <P_2,756> as sailors .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,756.48

Nothing , I suppose , but war will push the English to this policy ,
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,756.49

so it seems that they will consent to sink , unless a fit of the old
national pride precipitates them helplessly into the struggle .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,756.50

There is our present danger . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,756.51

Not less than an addition of 100,000 men to the army was needed when we
set foot on Egypt . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,756.52

However , the eldest son of Albert Edward has attained his majority ,
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,756.53

As it is your wish , and you have fallen into the English habit of
Dinners to promote conversation , I am happy to be at your disposal ,

I am heartily glad to get your report . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,757.74

I rather fear to offer myself for a short visit , lest it should vex her
to have to refuse , or distress her in accepting .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,757.75

For though her tenacity of life is wonderful indeed , she suffers under
any small excitement . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,757.76

MEREDITH-188X-2,2,766.298

He sees counterbalancing symptoms : MEREDITH-188X-2,2,766.299

Dear Mrs. Leslie , Your letter pleased her . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,782.735

She signified her wish that it should be answered .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,782.736

Her state is now much weaker . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,782.737

Three days back , after a drive , when I was with her in our sitting
room , she had a painful seizure , lasting some time , slow to pass off
: MEREDITH-188X-2,2,782.738

and this pleasure of the drive - the one left to her - has to be
abandoned . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,782.739

MEREDITH-188X-2,2,782.740

Now I have her spirit . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.967

- She went through a period of extreme distress , not sharp physical
suffering . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.968

The pain for us was the suspension of hope - MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.969

we dared not hope - MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.970

we had to pray for the end . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.971

She died peacefully . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.972

I came back 40 minutes later , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.973

and her hand was still warm - benignant of changes on her face .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.974

- The children were much strained . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.975

Will has gone to Normandy . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.976

Mariette is at present with Mrs. John Morley at Putney .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.977

I return to her there next week . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.978

- I know you are both with us at heart . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,789.979

My dear Friend , I am greatly comforted in the thought of my dear girl
being under the care of your wife . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.985

This place of withered recollections is like an old life to be lived
again without sunshine . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.986

I cross and recross it . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.987

Sharp spikes where flowers were . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.988

Death is death , as you say , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.989

but I get to her by consulting her thoughts and wishes -
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.990

and so she lives in me . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.991

This , if one has the strength of soul , brings a spirit to us .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.992

- I feel the blow as I get more distant from it .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.993

While she lingered I could not hope for it to last ,
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.994

and now I crave any of the latest signs of her breathing - a weakness of
my flesh . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.995

When the mind shall be steadier , I shall have her calmly present - past
all tears ... MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.996

September 26 , 1885 MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1000

My dear Stevenson , It has been a tragedy of 16 months , the last four
speechless . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1001

We never heard her voice after that stroke in May .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1002

She bore two operations with noble fortitude .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1003

Latterly there was great distress . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1004

Sharp physical anguish she had not to suffer .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1005

The end was peaceful , in her sisters' arms .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1006

I came 40 minutes later , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1007

found her hand warm , rest on her face . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1008

She has taught me , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1009

and leads me . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1010

I have ground for all of us in Dorking Cemetery , sweet sand-earth .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1011

I looked into her grave as to a home . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1012

But I am to have her spirit with me when I can tame my flesh to stop
moaning . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1013

- She was fond of you , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1014

understood you . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1015

We used often to speak of you . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1016

- Think of this among the pains of authors : MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1017

She was copying my MS. of <font> Diana <$$font> ,
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1018

and came - she knowing , I unknowing , her state - to a scene shrouding
a surgical operation , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1019

- and went through it . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1020

A week later she had seen Paget , and been condemned .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1021

Then first I heard . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1022

- I had hope in her strength . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1023

She had concealed the malady too long . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1024

- I love to hear you praise her . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,790.1025

<P_2,791>

Since last winter I have been near to writing word of us , failed in
some way . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1027

I had a copy of <font> Diana <$$font> for you .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1028

It must have been Mr. Henley's article in the <font> Athenaeum <$$font>
which floated her through her Editions . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1029

The article was read to Marie , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1030

and pleased her greatly . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1031

I want him to accept copies of the new issue of my novels .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1032

Power to write on has quitted me for the present .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1033

When away from here I am wretched with desire to return ,
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1034

and when here I feed on husks . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1035

- I have read pieces of <font> Prince Otto <$$font> , admiring the royal
manner of your cutting away of the novelist's lumber . Straight to
matter , is the secret . - Also approvingly your article on Style ; and
very gladly the announcements of new work from you .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1036

Rigorous anchorite's food has kept me going .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1037

I broke down twice . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1038

Now I scarce touch meat , never wine . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1039

When you can spare time for a word to me you will cheer .

My dear Mrs. Wilson , No friend of ours loved her or proved the love
more deeply than you . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1046

She felt it . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1047

She was the best of wives , truest among human creatures .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1048

She lies in Dorking Cemetery , where I have bought ground for us all to
be beside her in the dust . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1049

I believe in Spirit , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1050

and I have her with me here , though at present I can@ @not get to calm
of thought , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1051

all the scenes of her long endurance , and the days of peace before it
rise up . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1052

Will is in Normandy with his uncles and cousins .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1053

My Mariette abides for a time with Mrs. John Morely at Wimbledon .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1054

I would fain have a governess to tend and instruct her , that she might
be near me . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1055

But a young one would rouse tongues , it seems ;
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1056

and an old one would hardly suit the child . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1057

I think of placing her under Mdlle Souvestre at Wimbledon .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1058

Many friends of mine are acquainted with the lady ,
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,791.1059

and <P_2,792> value highly her discretion and accomplishments .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1060

Their girls have been at her school , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1061

have profited , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1062

and love her well . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1063

Meriette could then at least come to me once a fortnight -
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1064

as for me , I would gladly visit you , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1065

but I am wretched when I quit this neighbourhood despite the misery of

Dearest Mrs. Tom , She lies in Dorking Cemetery , where I have ground
for us all to be with her in the dust , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1073

Sweet sand-earth it is , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1074

and I never looked into a grave so homely - even to my senses .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1075

She died in her sisters' arms , peacefully at last .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1076

I found her hand still warm when I came , her face showing death desired
. MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1077

I could not regret it , MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1078

but the fate of a sunny-hearted woman struck in her noon , darkens me
now - with all the scenes of her days of suffering , and our time of
peace before . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1079

I believe in spirit - the life beyond the senses - of which we come ; as
I told you when you lost the visual presence of our dear Tom .

For the moment I am obscured , not shaken . MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1081

I think of sending her to Mdlle Souvestre at Wimbledon - a lady to whom
friends of mine have entrusted daughters with advantage .
MEREDITH-188X-2,2,792.1089
