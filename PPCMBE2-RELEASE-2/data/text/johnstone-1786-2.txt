Act II JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.4

Scene I . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.5

<font> The Baroness's Apartment . <$$font> JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.6

<font> The Baroness . Lisetta . <$$font> JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.7

<$$heading>

<font> Baroness . <$$font> We have got up <font> <paren> looking at her
watch <$$paren> <$$font> very early , Lisetta . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.9

<font> Lis. <$$font> Who the deuce can sleep in these large cities ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.10

the coaches , the watchmen , the drums , the cats , the <P_25> corporals
- JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.11

in short , one hears nothing but rattling , bawling , beating , wawling
, swearing , as if the night was made for every thing but sleeping .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.12

<font> Bar. <$$font> Time will hang heavy on our hands .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.13

<font> Lis. <$$font> Well then , to kill it , let us to the toilet , to
choose the dress we mean to give the first assault in .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.14

<font> Bar. <$$font> Why do you talk of assault , girl ; when I only
come here to demand the performance of the articles of capitulation ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.15

<font> Lis. <$$font> Were the officer we dislodged here , and sent
compliment to , a proficient in politeness , he would have requested the
honour of paying his respects ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.16

and that might occupy some part on@ @'t . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.17

<font> Bar. <$$font> Ay , Lisetta , all officers are not Holbergs ;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.18

but indeed the compliment was made , only to have an opportunity of
making some inquiries about him . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.19

Lisetta , my heart tells me that I shall be successful , and find him
here . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.20

<font> Lis. <$$font> We must not trust too much to the heart ;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.21

it is but too apt to get into the mouth , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.22

and were the mouth silly enough to say all it dictates , it would long
since have been the fashion to wear padlocks at our lips .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.23

<font> Bar. <$$font> A whimsical sort of a jewel , truly ;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.24

and yet , there are times when I should have no great objection to it .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.25

<font> Lis. <$$font> O Lord , no ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.26

better hide the finest set of teeth in the world , than let one's heart
be every moment leaping over them . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.27

<font> Bar. <$$font> Are you so discreet then ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.28

<font> Lis. <$$font> Not I , my lady ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.29

one seldom , you know , speaks of the virtues one has ; but of those one
has not . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.30

<font> Bar. <$$font> An excellent reflection , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.31

and puts me in mind of my Holberg . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.32

<font> Lis. <$$font> And pray what does not ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.33

<font> Bar. <$$font> Both friends and foes allow him to be the bravest
, and most generous man alive ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.34

yet , who ever heard him talk of bravery or generosity ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.35

His sense of honour is delicate to a proverb . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.36

Yet honour is a word he ne'er makes use of . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.37

<font> Lis. <$$font> What virtues does he speak of then ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.38

<font> Bar. <$$font> Of none ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.39

for in none is he deficient . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.40

<P_26>

<font> Lis. <$$font> Yet I have often heard him profess his truth and
constancy to you . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.42

What , suppose he should be an inconstant ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.43

<font> Bar. <$$font> Are you in earnest ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.44

<font> Lis. <$$font> Why - how long is it since he wrote to you ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.45

<font> Bar. <$$font> He has written but once since the peace . <font>
<paren> sighs <$$paren> <$$font> JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.46

<font> Lis. <$$font> That sigh is no prayer for the peace-makers .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.47

But what did he say ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.48

<font> Bar. <$$font> ' The peace , ' said he , ' is concluded ;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.49

and I consequently draw near to the accomplishment of all my wishes . '
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.50

- But to write that to me but once , Lisetta ! JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.51

<font> Lis. <$$font> Ay , and to throw upon us the fatigues of so long
a journey , " for the accomplishment of his wishes , deserves " -
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.52

but suppose he should have already accomplished his wishes , and we
should find here that - <font> Bar. <$$font> That he were dead ?
<font> <paren> hastily <$$paren> Lis. <$$font> To you , my lady , in
the arms of another . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.53

<font> Bar. <$$font> No , Lisetta ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.54

I am not afraid of that - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.55

Holberg can@ @not violate the most trivial engagement to any one , much
less a solemn contract with me , " the completion of which only waited
for my uncle's return from Italy . " <font> <paren> adjusting her dress
at a looking glass <$$paren> <$$font> JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.56

No , I am not afraid of that , Lisetta . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.57

His regiment was disbanded at the peace ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.58

who knows into what other regiment , or distant province , he may be
removed ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.59

who knows what circumstances - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.60

<font> <paren> a knocking at the door . <$$paren> <$$font>
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.61

<font> Lis. <$$font> Somebody at the door . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.62

<font> Bar. <$$font> Let them come in . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.63

JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.67

<$$heading>

<font> Katz. <$$font> Have I your ladyship's permission ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.69

<font> Lis. <$$font> O , 't@ @is our landlord . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.70

Let your body have the goodness to follow your head , that the door may
be shut . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.71

<font> Katz. <paren> entering with a pen behind his ear , paper and ink
in his hand <$$paren> <$$font> I come , my lady , to wish you a very
good morning ; as likewise to you , my pretty maid .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.72

<font> Lis. <$$font> A civil man this . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.73

<P_27>

<font> Bar. <$$font> We thank you , Sir . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.75

<font> Lis. <$$font> And with you the same , Sir .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.76

<font> Katz. <$$font> Dare I take the liberty of asking whether your
ladyship has slept well under my poor roof ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.77

<font> Lis. <$$font> The roof is well enough , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.78

but the beds might have been better . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.79

<font> Katz. <$$font> Should there be any thing that does not suit your
ladyship , you have only to please to give your orders .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.80

<font> Lis. <$$font> Ay , ay ; I mean to do that presently .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.81

<font> Katz. <$$font> This done , I come at the same time - <font>
<paren> taking the pen from behind his ear <$$paren> <$$font>
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.82

<font> Lis. <$$font> Well , what now ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.83

<font> Bar. <$$font> Your ladyship knows , without doubt , the wise
regulations of our police ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.84

<font> Bar. <$$font> Not I , indeed , landlord .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.85

<font> Katz. <$$font> We , landlords , are forbid to lodge any
strangers , of whatsoever rank or condition they may be , above
four_and_twenty hours , without sending their names , their rank , their
business , the probable length of their stay , and so forth , to the
proper officers . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.86

<font> Bar. <$$font> Very well . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.87

<font> Katz. <$$font> Your ladyship will therefore be pleased to -
<font> <paren> seats himself at a table to write <$$paren> <$$font>
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.88

<font> Bar. <$$font> Certainly : JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.89

my name is - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.90

<font> Katz. <$$font> A moment's patience , if you please .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.91

<font> <paren> writes <$$paren> <$$font> Berlin , 22d day of August , 17
&c. came to the Vulture - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.92

Now your name , if you please , my lady . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.93

<font> Bar. <$$font> Baroness of Bruchsal . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.94

<font> Katz. <$$font> Of Bruchsal ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.95

- From whence , my lady ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.96

<font> Bar. <$$font> From my estate in Saxony . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.97

<font> Katz. <$$font> Estate in Saxony - hum , Saxony -
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.98

<font> Lis. <$$font> Well , why not Saxony ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.99

Pray is it a crime , here in Prussia , to come out of Saxony ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.100

<font> Katz. <$$font> A crime ! JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.101

O Lord , no : that would be a new kind of a crime indeed !
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.102

From Saxony , your ladyship . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.103

Saxony the fair , the free , the - ay , ay , Saxony :
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.104

but Saxony is very large , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.105

and has many , what shall I call them , districts , provinces .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.106

- Our police is very particular , my lady . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.107

<font> Bar. <$$font> I understand : JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.108

from Thuringia , then , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.109

<P_28>

<font> Katz. <$$font> Thuringia , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.111

ay , ay , that will do JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.112

<font> <paren> writes and then reads <$$paren> <$$font> The Baroness of
Bruchsal , from her estate in Thuringia , with her woman and two
servants . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.113

<font> Lis. <$$font> Her woman ! JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.114

Meaning me , I suppose ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.115

<font> Katz. <$$font> Yes , my pretty maid . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.116

<font> Lis. <$$font> Now , landlord , instead of woman , please to put
down maid . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.117

The police is very particular , you know : JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.118

" a mistake of that kind might spoil my marriage ,
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.119

and I might remain a maid , which is not my intention . "
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.120

I was born upon her ladyship's estate , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.121

was brought up with her ladyship ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.122

we are both of one age , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.123

for next candlemas we shall both be one_and_twenty .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.124

My name is Lisetta , and my sirname Willinger . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.125

" I should be happy that the police should be so well acquainted with me
, as to have no room for any apprehensions {TEXT:apprensions} upon my
account . " JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.126

<font> Katz. <$$font> Very well , I shall set all that down by_and_by .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.127

But now , my lady , your business here ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.128

<font> Bar. <$$font> My business ! JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.129

<font> Katz. <$$font> Ay ; is your ladyship come to solicit any thing
from his majesty ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.130

<font> Bar. <$$font> Not I . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.131

<font> Katz. <$$font> Perhaps in our courts of law then ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.132

<font> Bar. <$$font> No . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.133

<font> Katz. <$$font> Or - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.134

<font> Bar. <$$font> No , no : I come here upon my own private affairs
. JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.135

<font> Katz. <$$font> True , please your ladyship ,
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.136

but what may they be ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.137

<font> Bar. <$$font> They are - Faith , Lisetta , I believe we shall be
taken up . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.138

<font> Lis. <$$font> Hark you , landlord , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.139

but it must go no further than the police ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.140

we are come to kidnap one of the King's officers .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.141

<font> Bar. <$$font> Lisetta , are you out of your senses ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.142

Landlord , the madcap is jesting with you . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.143

<font> Katz. <$$font> Ay , ay , with me she may jest as much as she
pleases , but not with the high and mighty police .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.144

<font> Bar. <$$font> I@ @'ll tell you , landlord , I am quite a novice
in such matters ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.145

suppose we were to defer your report till my uncle's arrival :
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.146

he will be here before the four_and_twenty <P_29> hours can expire ,
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.147

" and he will best know how much he must tell of his affairs , and what
he may conceal . " JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.148

- Is his apartment ready ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.149

<font> Lis. <$$font> Or have you some honest gentleman to turn out on@
@'t first ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.150

<font> Bar. <$$font> Indeed , landlord , in such a case , you ought not
to have taken us in . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.151

The person you have turned out on our account is , I hear , an officer .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.152

<font> Katz. <$$font> A disbanded one , my lady .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.153

<font> Bar. <$$font> So much the worse ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.154

he is then unfortunate JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.155

and may deserve a better fate . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.156

The king can@ @not know the merit of all the people in his service .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.157

<font> Katz. <$$font> O yes , he does , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.158

he knows them all , all . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.159

<font> Bar. <$$font> But then he ca@ @n't reward them all .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.160

<font> Katz. <$$font> O yes , they all had reward enough during the war
. JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.161

But if they will live away in time of peace , we landlords must take
heed . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.162

I might safely have let this Colonel run a month or two longer here ,
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.163

but 't@ @is as well as it is . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.164

- Apropos , your ladyship understands jewels , no doubt .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.165

I must shew your ladyship a beauty of a ring : JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.166

<font> <paren> taking the ring out <$$paren> <$$font> look here , what

the middle stone weighs above five carats , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.168

<font> Bar. <paren> looking at the ring <$$paren> <$$font> What do I
see ! JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.169

That ring - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.170

<font> Katz. <$$font> Ay , that ring is worth to one's own brother 300
pistoles . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.171

<font> Bar. <$$font> Look , Lisetta . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.172

<font> Katz. <$$font> I did not scruple a moment lending 80 on it .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.173

<font> Bar. <$$font> Do@ @n't you recollect it ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.174

<font> Katz. <$$font> Madam ! JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.175

<font> Katz <$$font> " That ring - very honestly , " very honestly
indeed , madam ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.181

my dear , sweet lady , do not bring me into trouble :
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.182

many things may have changed masters during the war , without the
consent of the original proprietors . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.183

I had it , I am sure , from a man I can@ @not suspect from a very good
man . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.184

<P_30>

<font> Bar. <$$font> From the best man breathing , unless you measure
his merit by his wealth . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.186

Holberg lodged here ! JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.196

" He pledged this ring to you ! " JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.197

How came he into such difficulties ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.198

Where is he ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.199

Is he in your debt ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.200

JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.209

<font> Bar. <$$font> Odious man ! JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.210

how could you treat him so unfriendly , so hardly , so cruelly ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.211

<font> Katz. <$$font> Your ladyship will pardon -
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.212

<font> Bar. <$$font> Quick , go , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.213

, though unworthy of the beauteous Caroline , durst look up to her , in
hopes , through that ambition , to become daily less so : I am no longer
that Holberg . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,34.381

No , Madam , I am the Holberg whose honour is tarnished , and fortune

Indeed , indeed , my dear Colonel , there is more wisdom in mirth than
sorrow : JOHNSTONE-1786-2,34.390

the one blunts the weapons of misfortune , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,34.391

and the other adds poison to their points . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,34.392

You are disbanded ; that is , you have now the liberty and leisure to be

the country of Thuringia was to be in money : JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.400

The sum was large , the notice short , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.401

and the orders sent to me were rigourous , in case of failure ;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.402

to prevent their execution , therefore , I was obliged to lend the
province a considerable sum that was deficient .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.403

<font> Bar. <$$font> Well do I remember it . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.404

debts from Saxony . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.405

'T@ @was stopt ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.406

the manner in which it became due was suspected , and my asseverations

JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.409

The generous action that lost you a few thousands , gained you the heart
of Caroline ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.410

and , if you do not rate her love above the paltry sum , take it on the
score of interest - sole heiress to my uncle , one of the richest
noblemen in Saxony . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.411

<font> Lis. <$$font> He is but a bad servant that has nothing but
honesty to recommend him . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,40.585

William , the valet , was quite another creature ;

why did not the Colonel keep him ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,40.598

though he did not want a huntsman , he was a clever fellow ,

<font> Rohf. <$$font> Oh yes , that he could ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,40.601

and so the Colonel recommended him to the commandant of Spandau .

Philip can turn his hand to any thing - a plot to take a few men over to

't@ @was a restif beast , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.614

" <font> Lis. <$$font> The villain ! " JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.616

<font> Rohf. <$$font> My poor master will never perhaps get such a
coachman again . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.617

<font> Lis. <$$font> After that , I@ @'m afraid to inquire after
Frederick , the running footman . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.618

JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.619

JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.620

<font> Rohf. <$$font> In a prison royal . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.621

Fred. picked up some agreeable acquaintances , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.622

borrowed my master's name , and money sometimes ;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.623

in short , was too genteel for my master ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.624

and since he left us , the police has taken such a liking to him , that
it spares no pains to keep him from over-heating himself by hard running
. JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.625

He was an excellent runner , to be sure ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.626

but there is no running against destiny . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.627

He was born for a more elevated situation . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.628

<font> Lis. <$$font> Oh , the wretch ! JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.629

<font> Rohf. <$$font> So , Mr. William , and Philip , and Martin , and

do@ @n't believe it - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,42.669

means , like his chamber fire , to last only for the winter ; but which
the kind soul , with whom he makes it , imagines is to last for life -

Yes , I with pleasure acknowledge , that I twice have owed my life to
you : JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.757

But <P_45> what , friend , has been ever wanting on my side , to have
done full as much for you ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.758

<font> War. <$$font> Only the opportunity , my brave Colonel ;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.759

but do not grudge me an opportunity - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.760

take this . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.761

<font> Col. <$$font> Warmans , why will you not understand me ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.762

I say , it is improper I should be your debtor , at least so situated as
I am at present . <font> War. <$$font> That is , you will reserve my
purse 'till you have no occasion to borrow ; or I no money left to lend
you . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.763

<font> Col. <$$font> You have , yourself , occasion for your money .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.764

<font> War. <$$font> None - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.765

whoever wants a Serjeant_Major will give him subsistence .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.766

<font> Col. <$$font> You have , to raise you to a level with your merit
, since I can@ @not . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.767

<font> War. <$$font> I have no views beyond my station ;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.768

and scorn promotion that is no reward . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.769

In short , at present I have no need of money ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.770

you have ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.771

your affairs must soon be settled , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.772

and then you shall repay with interest - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.773

I lend it you on interest . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.774

<font> Col. <$$font> No more , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.775

I@ @'ll not hear of it . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.776

<font> War. <$$font> On my soul , it is on interest that I lend it ,
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.777

What , thought I often to myself - what will become of thee , Warmans ,
in thy old age , when many years and many wounds have made an halbert
too heavy for thy hand - when thou hast nothing left , and when thou
must shame the honour of thy former life and go a begging ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.778

No , thou shalt not go a begging , thought I : JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.779

thou shalt go to Colonel Holberg ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.780

he will share his utmost penny with thee - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.781

thou shalt bask in his better fortune - shed thy grey hairs unsullied by
disgrace ; and be borne to an honourable grave , as becomes an old
soldier . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.782

<font> Col. <$$font> Well , comrade <font> <paren> snatching his hand
<$$paren> , <$$font> and do@ @n't you think so still ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.783

<font> War. <$$font> No , not now ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.784

he that will not accept from me when he wants , and I have - will not
give me , when he has , and I want - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.785

JOHNSTONE-1786-2,46.788

<P_49>

<font> Lis. <$$font> In the character of an eloped , disinherited - "
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.896

Lord , 't@ @will never do - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.897

a man to whom the bride's poverty is held out as an inducement to
matrimony , will make as much haste as a child when it is told to come

<font> Bar. <$$font> Holberg , you@ @'ll allow , is an exception ;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.899

his whole letter breathes such a noble soul , that his very refusal
endears him still the more - A man of honour and sentiments
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.900

<font> Lis. <$$font> Honour and sentiments ! JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.901

dear Ma'am , what man can brave the ridicule of being half a century
behind the fashion ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.902

<font> Bar. <$$font> He can - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.903

I know him , Lisetta ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.904

he that now refuses the rich Baroness , would contend against the whole
world for his Caroline , when poor enough to stand in need of his
assistance . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.905

<font> Lis. <$$font> Pray does he owe these encomiums to the good
opinion you have of him , or - <font> Bar. <$$font> Or myself ,
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.906

out with it . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.907

<font> Lis. <$$font> Well then - 't@ @is out . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.908

<font> Bar. <$$font> Why both , perhaps . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.909

<font> Lis. <$$font> But what opinion will your uncle have ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.910

Wo@ @n't he be apt to think you very eager for a husband , that you
could not wait a few hours till his arrival - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.911

and may not he make the jest too true for us to laugh at ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.912

<font> Bar. <$$font> No , Lisetta - uncle will be the first to laugh at
the jest when successful : JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.913

but he is proud - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.914

hates the Prussians - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.915

and should he arrive before we have lured Holberg from this eagle-flight
, he will interpret the word <font> honour <$$font> in our Colonel's
refusal by the word <font> contempt <$$font> , and break off the match ,
perhaps , for ever . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.916

Holberg , on the other hand , is resolute - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.917

<font> Lis. <$$font> The strength of his resolution is rather dubious ,
I think , when he doubts of it himself ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.918

<font> Bar. <$$font> How can I ? JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.920

. JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.921

Can any mortal resist a Danae and a golden shower together ?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.922

<font> Bar. <$$font> You mistake his character , Lisetta :
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,49.923

that honour , which love now lays almost asleep in his intercourse
<P_50> with us , will be awakened by pride at the arrival of the Count -
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,50.924

Yes , I am sure I am right ; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,50.925

so mind your cues , girl . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,50.926

Let me manage as I please with my Colonel , JOHNSTONE-1786-2,50.931

Which must have been , that you would never abandon a woman of honour ,
whose affections you had engaged . JOHNSTONE-1786-2,50.960

Well , well ; I would rather hear you tell me all that .
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,50.961

<font> Col. <$$font> Madam , I meant to tell you , that our separation
must be imputed , not to me , but to inevitable fate : which calls you
to the enjoyment of every happiness <P_51> friends , fortune , and your
country can afford ; while it fixes me here , to suffer the extreme of
wretchedness in vindication of my injured honour ;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,51.962

soon opened every avenue to the warm beams of tenderness .
