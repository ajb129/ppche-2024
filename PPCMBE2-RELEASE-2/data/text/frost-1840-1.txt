SPECIAL ASSIZE , MONMOUTH . FROST-1840-1,162.4

<font> Thursday , 2 January <$$font> 1840 . FROST-1840-1,162.5

<$$heading>

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Will your Lordship permit me to
mention , in the presence of the Attorney-general - your Lordships
reserved the point which was argued last night for further consideration
. FROST-1840-1,162.7

I presume , my Lord , the effect of that would be to place Mr. Frost in
precisely the same situation as if it had been decided in his favour .
FROST-1840-1,162.8

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> It must be , my Lord , the same
as in all other cases . FROST-1840-1,162.9

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> It is a very common course
to take at assizes , when a point arises which suggests a difficulty to
the judges . FROST-1840-1,162.10

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Your Lordships can@ @not suppose that
I am making any objection to that course . FROST-1840-1,162.11

I am merely asking this , and the Attorney-general himself being here ,
makes it a matter very easy to be arranged , that in the event of your
Lordships being of opinion that the objection ought to have prevailed at
the trial , Mr. Frost may be placed in the same situation as if it had
prevailed . FROST-1840-1,162.12

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> No doubt about that ;
FROST-1840-1,162.13

he will be in the same situation as if we had decided it at the time .
FROST-1840-1,162.14

If , upon consideration and consultation with the judges , we think the
objection ought to have prevailed , it will be as if it had prevailed at
the moment . FROST-1840-1,162.15

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> And the verdict will be accordingly .
FROST-1840-1,162.16

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> No . FROST-1840-1,162.17

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Mr. Frost , my Lord , will be
in the same situation as all the rest of Her Majesty's subjects under
similar circumstances . FROST-1840-1,162.18

This case does not differ from any other case . FROST-1840-1,162.19

Mr. Serjeant <font> Ludlow . <$$font> There is nothing new in this
case , Sir Frederick Pollock . FROST-1840-1,162.20

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> My learned friend , Mr. Serjeant
Ludlow , says , there is nothing new in this case ; FROST-1840-1,162.21

I dare say there is not . FROST-1840-1,162.22

But why that observation should be addressed to me , and not to the
court , I can@ @not understand ; FROST-1840-1,162.23

I have difficulties enough to struggle with in performing this
overwhelming duty , as far as <P_163> my own feelings are concerned ,
without having to meet such observations as those ; FROST-1840-1,163.24

and I would request my learned friend not to suppose I come uninstructed
in points of law ; FROST-1840-1,163.25

I am aware of that which he states . FROST-1840-1,163.26

My attention was first called , in professional life , to the case of a
person named Walsh , convicted of defrauding another party .
FROST-1840-1,163.27

It was decided , that he ought to have been acquitted ;
FROST-1840-1,163.28

and yet he remained under attainder for the rest of his life .
FROST-1840-1,163.29

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> I do not know any thing
about that case ; FROST-1840-1,163.30

I have explained the position in which the prisoner will stand if this
point should be decided by the judges in his favour .
FROST-1840-1,163.31

It will be precisely the same as if we had now so decided it .
FROST-1840-1,163.32

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> If that is understood , my Lord , I
have no further observation to make . FROST-1840-1,163.33

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> It is understood that the state
of things will be precisely the same in this case as in all other cases
, where the learned judges reserve a point for the consideration of
their learned brethren assembled at Westminster . FROST-1840-1,163.34

There is no special course to be adopted here . FROST-1840-1,163.35

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Not at all . FROST-1840-1,163.36

If there is a conviction , and the judges are of opinion that the
objection is well-founded , a pardon will be issued at the
recommendation of the Secretary of State , as a matter of course .
FROST-1840-1,163.37

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> With all deference , my Lord , that
is not placing the subject in the same situation . FROST-1840-1,163.38

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> That is the only course that could
be pursued ; because you can find no instance , in a criminal case , of
a judge reserving a point for the consideration of all the judges , in
the same way as a judge does at <font> nisi prius . <$$font>
FROST-1840-1,163.39

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I thought , my Lord , that in this
case the presence of the Attorney-general representing the Crown might
make a difference . FROST-1840-1,163.40

I am aware that can@ @not be done at the assizes ; FROST-1840-1,163.41

but with all deference to the court and my learned friend , Mr.
Serjeant Ludlow , it did appear to me that the presence of the
Attorney-general here , representing the Crown , and consenting that the
verdict should be entered for the defendant if this point were decided
in his favour , would make a difference . FROST-1840-1,163.42

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> My Lord , in this case the law
must take its course . FROST-1840-1,163.43

At present your Lordship overrules the objection , subject to the
consideration that it may undergo by your Lordships , assisted by your
learned brethren at Westminster . FROST-1840-1,163.44

Mr. Justice <font> Williams . <$$font> With precisely the same
consequences that follow in other cases of the same kind .
FROST-1840-1,163.45

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Exactly , my Lord , in other
cases of the same kind ; FROST-1840-1,163.46

I can@ @not consent , filling the situation that I do , <P_164> to
deviate from the established practice that has existed in England for
centuries . FROST-1840-1,164.47

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Then I can only say that it is high
time that that practice was altered by a competent authority .
FROST-1840-1,164.48

I am very much surprised that a different practice has not prevailed ,
by the Attorney-general consenting . FROST-1840-1,164.49

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> My Lord , there should surely
be an end to these interlocutory observations . FROST-1840-1,164.50

I wish to treat my learned friend with the courtesy and respect to which
he is entitled , FROST-1840-1,164.51

and I hope I have done so , and shall continue to do so ;
FROST-1840-1,164.52

but I must deprecate these irregular observations . FROST-1840-1,164.53

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Certainly . FROST-1840-1,164.54

<heading>

<font> Samuel Simmons sworn . <$$font> FROST-1840-1,164.56

<$$heading>

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> My Lord , there was another objection
to the witness . FROST-1840-1,164.58

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> Yes . FROST-1840-1,164.59

I am now about to examine him on the <font> voir_dire . <$$font>
FROST-1840-1,164.60

<bracket> To the witness . <$$bracket> Where do you live ?
FROST-1840-1,164.61

- Newport . FROST-1840-1,164.62

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> It must be understood that we are allowed
to question him on the <font> voir_dire ? <$$font> FROST-1840-1,164.63

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Of course .
FROST-1840-1,164.64

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Is there some objection
made to the description ? FROST-1840-1,164.65

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> I understood so .
FROST-1840-1,164.66

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> It is not to be understood that that
objection is to be deferred for further consideration ?
FROST-1840-1,164.67

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> By no means , my Lord .
FROST-1840-1,164.68

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> <bracket> <font> To the
witness . <$$font> <$$bracket> In what parish do you live ?
FROST-1840-1,164.69

- In the parish of St. Woollos . FROST-1840-1,164.70

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> I think it may be convenient
if we hand up to your Lordships a copy of the printed list .
FROST-1840-1,164.71

<bracket> <font> The list was handed up . <$$font> <$$bracket>
FROST-1840-1,164.72

This is in page 10 . FROST-1840-1,164.73

It is alphabetical , my Lord . FROST-1840-1,164.74

- <bracket> <font> To the witness . <$$font> <$$bracket> Do you know
the borough of Newport ? FROST-1840-1,164.75

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,164.76

Is the parish of St. Woollos in the borough of Newport ?
FROST-1840-1,164.77

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,164.78

<heading>

<font> Cross-examined on the <$$font> Voir_dire . FROST-1840-1,164.80

<$$heading>

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> You live at Newport ?
FROST-1840-1,164.82

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,164.83

Do you know the parish of St. Woollos ? FROST-1840-1,164.84

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,164.85

Is it not a very large parish ? FROST-1840-1,164.86

- I believe it is . FROST-1840-1,164.87

Much larger than the borough of Newport ? FROST-1840-1,164.88

- I can@ @not say . FROST-1840-1,164.89

I do not know the nature of the borough of Newport , not altogether .
FROST-1840-1,164.90

<P_165>

Do you not know that there are several townships ? FROST-1840-1,165.92

Do you know the limits of the borough of Newport ? FROST-1840-1,165.93

- My Lord , the limits of the borough of Newport , I believe , will
appear from the Municipal Corporation Act . FROST-1840-1,165.94

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Yes . FROST-1840-1,165.95

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> From the Boundary Act ?
FROST-1840-1,165.96

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> From the Boundary Act .
FROST-1840-1,165.97

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> I dare say we can agree upon
that . FROST-1840-1,165.98

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> <bracket> <font> To the witness .
<$$font> <$$bracket> Is not the parish a very large parish ?
FROST-1840-1,165.99

- Yes ; I believe it is . FROST-1840-1,165.100

Does it not go beyond the borough of Newport ? FROST-1840-1,165.101

- I can@ @not say for a certainty of that . FROST-1840-1,165.102

Have not you always understood that it is a very large parish ?
FROST-1840-1,165.103

- Yes , it is very large . FROST-1840-1,165.104

And embracing land round about that is not in the borough of Newport ?
FROST-1840-1,165.105

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,165.106

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> My Lord , perhaps we could agree upon
the fact without calling any other evidence . FROST-1840-1,165.107

I believe there is no doubt about this , that the parish of St. Woollos
is a very large parish , of which the borough of Newport is part .
FROST-1840-1,165.108

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> I am told , which I am very
ready to admit , that the parish of St. Woollos is more extensive than
the borough of Newport . FROST-1840-1,165.109

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Does he live in that part of the
parish which is in the borough ? FROST-1840-1,165.110

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Yes , my Lord .
FROST-1840-1,165.111

These are the facts . FROST-1840-1,165.112

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Those are not all the facts .
FROST-1840-1,165.113

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> The whole of the borough of Newport ,
I am informed , is in the parish of St. Woollos , the parish being a
very large parish , including more than the borough , but the whole of
the borough being in the parish . FROST-1840-1,165.114

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Is that so ? FROST-1840-1,165.115

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> No , my Lord , that is not so .
FROST-1840-1,165.116

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Will you tell me what you understand
to be the fact ? FROST-1840-1,165.117

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> There is a part of the borough
in another parish . FROST-1840-1,165.118

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> My Lord , I understand the fact to be
as I represented it at first , that that was the condition of things
before the Municipal Corporations Act , since which there has been added
to the borough for the purposes of that Act <paren> your Lordships will
say whether that is for all purposes <$$paren> a portion of another
parish . FROST-1840-1,165.119

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Part of the parish in question
. FROST-1840-1,165.120

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> We may take that as admitted .
FROST-1840-1,165.121

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> I believe , my Lord , that is
the fact . FROST-1840-1,165.122

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> But , perhaps , your Lordships would
permit <P_166> me to call a witness and prove one fact , inasmuch as
this objection , if it be of any importance , extends to a very
considerable number of witnesses . FROST-1840-1,166.123

I see in the page before me at least five or six , FROST-1840-1,166.124

and I am told that there are many in the other pages .
FROST-1840-1,166.125

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Will you have the goodness to read
that part of the Act which adds the parish , and for what purpose it is
added ? FROST-1840-1,166.126

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> The Act , my Lord , is not in court ,
FROST-1840-1,166.127

we have sent for it . FROST-1840-1,166.128

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Will your Lordship permit me , in the mean
time , to ask the witness with reference to his own residence ?
FROST-1840-1,166.129

- <bracket> <font> To the witness . <$$font> <$$bracket> How long have
you lived in the place where you live now ? FROST-1840-1,166.130

- I have lived in the place about twelve months , but in the town about
seventeen years . FROST-1840-1,166.131

Will you endeavour to explain where it is that you live now ?
FROST-1840-1,166.132

- I live just below the Salutation . FROST-1840-1,166.133

An inn or a public-house , called the Salutation ? FROST-1840-1,166.134

- Yes , an inn . FROST-1840-1,166.135

Where is the Salutation , then ? FROST-1840-1,166.136

- In the borough of Newport , I believe . FROST-1840-1,166.137

But is it in any street ? FROST-1840-1,166.138

- Yes ; it stands at the side of Cardiff-street ; FROST-1840-1,166.139

it stands at the side of the street that goes to Pill .
FROST-1840-1,166.140

Do you mean that Cardiff-street leads out of the street in which the
Salutation is ? FROST-1840-1,166.141

- No , the street is called Cardiff-street . FROST-1840-1,166.142

Then , the Salutation is in Cardiff-street ? FROST-1840-1,166.143

- No , on a piece of waste ground , standing on the side of
Cardiff-street . FROST-1840-1,166.144

Is your house in Cardiff-street ? FROST-1840-1,166.145

- No . FROST-1840-1,166.146

Your house , you say , is a little below the Salutation ?
FROST-1840-1,166.147

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,166.148

In what direction will you be going if you leave the Salutation , and go
towards your house ; FROST-1840-1,166.149

where does the street or road lead to ? FROST-1840-1,166.150

- It goes off towards Pill ; FROST-1840-1,166.151

you turn on the right , just below the Salutation inn .
FROST-1840-1,166.152

What is the name of the road , or place or street in which your house is
? FROST-1840-1,166.153

- It is a tram-road that the coals and iron go down by .
FROST-1840-1,166.154

There is no other road than a tram-road ? FROST-1840-1,166.155

- No . FROST-1840-1,166.156

Are there any other houses near yours ? FROST-1840-1,166.157

- Yes ; there are a_dozen houses in the same place .
FROST-1840-1,166.158

Can you tell me the name of the place , or street , or road , or
whatever you call it ? FROST-1840-1,166.159

- There is a place below that , used to be called Mountjoy ;
FROST-1840-1,166.160

I do not know any name to the street . FROST-1840-1,166.161

How far is your house from the Westgate Inn ? FROST-1840-1,166.162

- About a quarter of a mile ; FROST-1840-1,166.163

it may be a little better . FROST-1840-1,166.164

Do you get out of the town , that is , the place where the houses
discontinue , before you get to your house , FROST-1840-1,166.165

or are there houses all the way ? FROST-1840-1,166.166

- There are houses all the way . FROST-1840-1,166.167

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> From the Westgate Inn ?
FROST-1840-1,166.168

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,166.169

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Do you mean that there is any row of
houses that leads from the Salutation up to your house ?
FROST-1840-1,166.170

- No , not a <P_167> row from the Salutation ; FROST-1840-1,167.171

you go past the Salutation a little bit , FROST-1840-1,167.172

and then it turns on the right hand . FROST-1840-1,167.173

Are there houses still all the way to your house ? FROST-1840-1,167.174

- Yes , all the way . FROST-1840-1,167.175

Is there no name to the place in which those houses are ?
FROST-1840-1,167.176

- I never heard a name ; FROST-1840-1,167.177

it is a tram-road , which all the coal goes down , and iron ;
FROST-1840-1,167.178

it never had any name to it . FROST-1840-1,167.179

Did you never have letters directed to you ? FROST-1840-1,167.180

- No , never in my life . FROST-1840-1,167.181

Nor any body near where you are ? FROST-1840-1,167.182

- Not that I know of ; not my family . FROST-1840-1,167.183

Is your house rated ? FROST-1840-1,167.184

- No . FROST-1840-1,167.185

Neither to the poor-rate nor the borough-rate ? FROST-1840-1,167.186

- No ; my house is only 6 <font> +L . <$$font> a year .
FROST-1840-1,167.187

If I understand you , this tram-road goes right past your house ?
FROST-1840-1,167.188

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,167.189

By the tram-road is the only way in which you can get to your house ?
FROST-1840-1,167.190

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,167.191

Where does that tram-road go to ? FROST-1840-1,167.192

- It goes all the way up to the hills . FROST-1840-1,167.193

From Newport up to the hills ? FROST-1840-1,167.194

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,167.195

I will merely ask you the question , FROST-1840-1,167.196

do you , of your own knowledge , know how far the ancient borough
extends ? FROST-1840-1,167.197

- No , I can@ @not say how far . FROST-1840-1,167.198

Do you know how far the parish extends ? FROST-1840-1,167.199

- No , I do not . FROST-1840-1,167.200

What is the most distant part of the parish from your house that you
know of ; FROST-1840-1,167.201

how far does it go ? FROST-1840-1,167.202

- I can@ @not say ; FROST-1840-1,167.203

for miles all round the place , FROST-1840-1,167.204

but I can@ @not say how far . FROST-1840-1,167.205

Does it not extend for miles beyond the town ? FROST-1840-1,167.206

- I can@ @not say how far the parish goes . FROST-1840-1,167.207

Not exactly ; FROST-1840-1,167.208

but you used the expression " miles ; FROST-1840-1,167.209

" do you not know that it extends for miles round the town ?
FROST-1840-1,167.210

- I know for miles round the town . FROST-1840-1,167.211

<heading>

<font> Re-examined on the <$$font> Voir-dire . FROST-1840-1,167.213

<$$heading>

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> You say you live near the
Salutation ? FROST-1840-1,167.215

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,167.216

Do you remember the 4th of November ? FROST-1840-1,167.217

- Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Stay ; FROST-1840-1,167.218

we are waiting for the Municipal Reform Act . FROST-1840-1,167.219

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> We may assume that it is
here . FROST-1840-1,167.220

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> I want to refer to that Act in order
to see for what purpose another parish is added to the borough .
FROST-1840-1,167.221

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> " For the purposes of the
Act , " probably , are the words . FROST-1840-1,167.222

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Very possibly . FROST-1840-1,167.223

<P_168>

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> It is possible that the Municipal Act may
show in some way or other what the connexion between the other parish
and the borough really is ; FROST-1840-1,168.225

but if it should be necessary , we will inquire of some person who does
know , and ascertain the fact ; because I understand that the ancient
borough is within the parish , but forms a very small portion of that
parish . FROST-1840-1,168.226

Certain additions are made for the particular purposes of the Act to the
ancient borough ; FROST-1840-1,168.227

those additions may not be within the parish . FROST-1840-1,168.228

But with regard to the parish itself , it is a very large parish of
several miles in extent ; FROST-1840-1,168.229

the parish is not in the borough ; FROST-1840-1,168.230

but on the contrary , the borough is in the parish , and forming a small
part of the parish . FROST-1840-1,168.231

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> He lives in both ; in the
part of the parish that is in the borough . FROST-1840-1,168.232

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> So it stands , my Lord .
FROST-1840-1,168.233

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> That may be so . FROST-1840-1,168.234

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Now , my Lord , subject to any
objection that my learned friend may make to the facts as they stand ,
we propose to proceed to examine the witness . FROST-1840-1,168.235

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> If your objection is founded upon
the Municipal Corporation Act , the Act should be here ;
FROST-1840-1,168.236

in future , if you found objections upon any Act , be so good as to have
it here . FROST-1840-1,168.237

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I made inquiries , my Lord ,
FROST-1840-1,168.238

and I understood that there would be immediate access to the statutes .
FROST-1840-1,168.239

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> I merely suggested that , because
for the future it would save time if , when you founded an objection
upon an Act of Parliament , you had the Act here ; FROST-1840-1,168.240

for though we are supposed to keep the statutes in our heads , we do not
. FROST-1840-1,168.241

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Your Lordship can hardly suppose that
the counsel would bring all the statutes from London .
FROST-1840-1,168.242

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> No , certainly not .
FROST-1840-1,168.243

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> We understood that they would be here
. FROST-1840-1,168.244

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> The gentleman who instructs us sent
throughout the town for the Act , in the hope of being able to procure
it , FROST-1840-1,168.245

but was unable . FROST-1840-1,168.246

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> My Lord , it would be really some
convenience if your Lordships would order , as sometimes is the case ,
that the statutes should be put upon the table . FROST-1840-1,168.247

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> The town-clerk will have it
. FROST-1840-1,168.248

There must be a copy of the Acts somewhere in the town .
FROST-1840-1,168.249

Mr. <font> Mallion , <$$font> <paren> the Crier . <$$paren> The
under-sheriff has gone for the town-clerk . FROST-1840-1,168.250

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> We had better go on ,
FROST-1840-1,168.251

and you can make your objection afterwards . FROST-1840-1,168.252

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I have no objection , my Lord , to
that course . FROST-1840-1,168.253

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> In fact it is a general
objection to this description . FROST-1840-1,168.254

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Yes , my Lord , it applies to many
others . FROST-1840-1,168.255

<P_169>

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> It is an insufficient description .
FROST-1840-1,169.257

There can be no objection to the witness being examined conditionally .
FROST-1840-1,169.258

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> <bracket> <font> To the

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> My Lord , I do not understand the last

The witness's answer was , " I saw some of them firing . "
FROST-1840-1,172.436

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> " I saw some of the people
firing who had gone up to the Westgate . " FROST-1840-1,172.437

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Yes , my Lord ; so I understood ;

or what had become of them ? FROST-1840-1,172.446

come from any part of the Westgate or from any soldiers ?

- I did not . FROST-1840-1,173.468

my learned friend should not mix the cross-examination upon the merits

FROST-1840-1,175.611

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> That is very desirable ,

FROST-1840-1,175.614

Was that before the firing had commenced ? FROST-1840-1,176.638

- I did not stay at that place long . FROST-1840-1,176.646

- I stood there about five minutes , I suppose . FROST-1840-1,176.649

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,176.651

Did you make a deposition before the magistrates ; that is , did you

and you were sworn FROST-1840-1,176.655

and gave evidence ? FROST-1840-1,176.656

course is to have the deposition read . FROST-1840-1,176.664

they rushed in at the door ; FROST-1840-1,177.690

I heard the guns fired , FROST-1840-1,177.691

FROST-1840-1,178.732

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,178.733

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> One of the jury wished to put a
question . FROST-1840-1,178.734

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> What was the question , sir
, you wished to put ? FROST-1840-1,178.735

<font> Foreman of the Jury . <$$font> Simmons stated , my Lord , that
they halted at the machine , FROST-1840-1,178.736

and afterwards he said that they marched ; FROST-1840-1,178.737

I wish to put the question to him , whom does he mean by " they ?
FROST-1840-1,178.738

" Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Whom did you mean by "
they , " when you said , " after they halted , they marched ? "
FROST-1840-1,178.739

- All the mob . FROST-1840-1,178.740

<font> Foreman . <$$font> Was there any body directing the mob when
they marched then ? FROST-1840-1,178.741

- Nobody , except Mr. Frost ; FROST-1840-1,178.742

he said , they were to go towards the town , and show themselves to the
town . FROST-1840-1,178.743

You stated that Frost was on the pavement , by the anchor-shop , and
that he said , " show your appearance to the front ; "
FROST-1840-1,178.744

do you mean to swear that those were the exact words that Mr. Frost
spoke to the men ? FROST-1840-1,178.745

- <bracket> Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> You are quite
right , sir , in putting the question , if you have any doubt .
<$$bracket> FROST-1840-1,178.746

- That was as near as I could understand it . FROST-1840-1,178.747

You stated , also , that there were soldiers in the Westgate Inn ;
FROST-1840-1,178.748

do you know , of your own knowledge , that there were soldiers in the
Westgate at the time ? FROST-1840-1,178.749

- Yes , there were soldiers in the Westgate Inn . FROST-1840-1,178.750

Did you see them ? FROST-1840-1,178.751

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,178.752

You have also stated that you saw Frost before you went to Mallock's
house ; FROST-1840-1,178.753

how long after the firing commenced did you see him ?
FROST-1840-1,178.754

- I did not see him long after the firing began ; FROST-1840-1,178.755

he was out of my sight . FROST-1840-1,178.756

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> This matter of description , I
suppose , your Lordships would wish to dispose of now .
FROST-1840-1,178.757

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> <$$bracket> <font> To the witness .
<$$font> <$$bracket> I , perhaps , have not quite understood you ;
FROST-1840-1,178.758

but how far is your present house from the Salutation ?
FROST-1840-1,178.759

- Not 100 yards . FROST-1840-1,178.760

To the best of your knowledge , is it about 100 yards , or rather less ?
FROST-1840-1,178.761

- Rather less . FROST-1840-1,178.762

About 90 yards , perhaps ? FROST-1840-1,178.763

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,178.764

Do you know , of your own knowledge , whether that house of yours is
within the boundary of the borough of Newport , the old borough of
Newport ? FROST-1840-1,178.765

- Indeed , I can@ @not say ; FROST-1840-1,178.766

I never paid any rates or taxes , FROST-1840-1,178.767

and I can@ @not say . FROST-1840-1,178.768

<P_179>

Now , I have only one more question to ask you upon this point ;
FROST-1840-1,179.770

you have said that the parish of St. Woollos extends for miles round ;
FROST-1840-1,179.771

I want to know what is the most distant place from the borough of
Newport that you know of in the parish of St. Woollos ?
FROST-1840-1,179.772

- I know of one place , the other side of Stowe a good way ,
FROST-1840-1,179.773

I can@ @not mention the place's name . FROST-1840-1,179.774

How far off is the most distant place that you know ?
FROST-1840-1,179.775

- About two miles . FROST-1840-1,179.776

And in what direction is that ; towards Cardiff , or towards Chepstow ?
FROST-1840-1,179.777

- Neither way . FROST-1840-1,179.778

Which way then ? FROST-1840-1,179.779

- Towards Stowe church . FROST-1840-1,179.780

Do you know whether that is east , west , north or south ?
FROST-1840-1,179.781

- I think it is south . FROST-1840-1,179.782

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> He must be wrong in that .
FROST-1840-1,179.783

I should think , my Lord , that my learned friend might raise this point
by the admission that I made at once to my learned friend , Sir
Frederick Pollock , that the parish extends beyond the borough .
FROST-1840-1,179.784

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> The parish extends beyond the
boundary of the borough . FROST-1840-1,179.785

Does not that answer your purpose ? FROST-1840-1,179.786

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Not exactly , my Lord , because there is a
difference between its extending beyond the boundary and its being of
considerable extent , and forming a great proportion of the parish .
FROST-1840-1,179.787

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Does it signify whether it is an
acre or 20 miles ? FROST-1840-1,179.788

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> I think your Lordship will find that makes
a difference . FROST-1840-1,179.789

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> There is another fact ;
FROST-1840-1,179.790

the place where the witness describes his house to have been is 90 yards
from the Salutation , and in the direction towards Cardiff .
FROST-1840-1,179.791

Mr. <font> Attorney_general . <$$font> He says just the contrary .
FROST-1840-1,179.792

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> He says not towards Cardiff .
FROST-1840-1,179.793

- <bracket> <font> To the witness . <$$font> <$$bracket> Is it towards
Pillgwenlly ? FROST-1840-1,179.794

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,179.795

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> It is the same thing ,
FROST-1840-1,179.796

and I am told that the Salutation Inn , or at all events , a point
within 90 yards , is the boundary of the borough ; so that where he
lives is not within the borough . FROST-1840-1,179.797

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Perhaps it will be more convenient , as
the witness does not appear to know it of his own knowledge , to prove
the fact ? FROST-1840-1,179.798

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I presume , my Lord , that I am at
liberty to call a witness to prove the boundary of the borough ?
FROST-1840-1,179.799

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> You are raising an
objection , on the ground of mis-description ; FROST-1840-1,179.800

I think you have a right to do that when the witness does not know it
himself . FROST-1840-1,179.801

<P_180>

<heading>

<font> Thomas Prothero , Esq. , sworn on the <$$font> Voir_dire .
FROST-1840-1,180.804

<$$heading>

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> You have been long acquainted with
the boundaries of the borough of Newport , the old borough ?
FROST-1840-1,180.806

- I can@ @not speak to the boundary of the old borough very distinctly ,
FROST-1840-1,180.807

but I believe that the boundary of the old borough is somewhere about
the Salutation Inn ; FROST-1840-1,180.808

my reason for saying that is , that the Salutation was always licensed
by the magistrates of the borough before the Corporation Act .
FROST-1840-1,180.809

Have you held some situation connected with the borough ?
FROST-1840-1,180.810

- Yes ; I held the situation of town clerk for a great many years .
FROST-1840-1,180.811

Did they walk the boundaries ? FROST-1840-1,180.812

- They never did for a great many years , that I remember ;
FROST-1840-1,180.813

I never perambulated the borough . FROST-1840-1,180.814

You say that the Salutation Inn is within the boundary ?
FROST-1840-1,180.815

- I think the Salutation Inn is within the boundary of the old borough ;
FROST-1840-1,180.816

and my reason for thinking so is , that the magistrates of the old
borough licensed it . FROST-1840-1,180.817

But had you not your attention once directed to the situation of some
property there , by the question coming before the court here , the
other court ? FROST-1840-1,180.818

- I do not recollect ; FROST-1840-1,180.819

if you will remind me of any circumstance , perhaps I may recollect it ;
FROST-1840-1,180.820

but at present , I do not . FROST-1840-1,180.821

Do you remember an action conducted by a solicitor of the name of Evans
, where the plaintiff was nonsuited , where the cause in part turned , I
am told , upon the fact of the Salutation Inn being within the borough ?
FROST-1840-1,180.822

- I really do not ; FROST-1840-1,180.823

perhaps you can mention some other circumstances ; FROST-1840-1,180.824

but I have scarcely a doubt in my own mind that the Salutation was
within the limits of the old borough . FROST-1840-1,180.825

Is it at the extremity of the limits ? FROST-1840-1,180.826

- I think it must be very near the extremity of the old , and the
commencement of the new borough . FROST-1840-1,180.827

How many years were you town clerk ? FROST-1840-1,180.828

- I think about five or six_and_twenty years . FROST-1840-1,180.829

Do you know where this man lives ? FROST-1840-1,180.830

- Now that I hear the man give his evidence , from his description I do
know . FROST-1840-1,180.831

Is not that without the boundary of the old borough ?
FROST-1840-1,180.832

- I believe there is an old road near the barn that he speaks of ,
called Mountjoy Farm , that was the boundary of the old borough ;
FROST-1840-1,180.833

but I can only say that from belief . FROST-1840-1,180.834

I ask you , having been 25 years the town clerk , whether , to the best
of your knowledge and acquaintance with the borough , the place that he
has described is not without the borough ? FROST-1840-1,180.835

- I really can@ @not say . FROST-1840-1,180.836

I ask you your belief ? FROST-1840-1,180.837

- I can@ @not say ; FROST-1840-1,180.838

it must be very near <P_181> the limits of the old borough , and very
near the commencement of that part of the parish that was comprised in
the borough . FROST-1840-1,181.839

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> That was added to the borough ?
FROST-1840-1,181.840

- That was added to the borough . FROST-1840-1,181.841

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Were you the town clerk at the time
that the Reform Bill passed ? FROST-1840-1,181.842

- Yes , I was . FROST-1840-1,181.843

Did you not yourself , personally , give instructions with regard to the
boundary of the borough , before it was enlarged ? FROST-1840-1,181.844

- I did not ; FROST-1840-1,181.845

I did not act as town clerk for several years before I ceased to hold
the office . FROST-1840-1,181.846

Who did ? FROST-1840-1,181.847

- Sir Thomas Phillips , my partner . FROST-1840-1,181.848

Perhaps you will be able to tell me whether the parish of St. Woollos
does not extend many miles round the borough ? FROST-1840-1,181.849

- Yes , it does . FROST-1840-1,181.850

The old borough , I believe , was entirely within it ?
FROST-1840-1,181.851

- The old borough was entirely within it . FROST-1840-1,181.852

And formed a very small part of it ? FROST-1840-1,181.853

- Not a small part . FROST-1840-1,181.854

Is it a half , or a third , or a tenth ? FROST-1840-1,181.855

- It is certainly very much more than a tenth ; FROST-1840-1,181.856

but I should not think that the extent of surface was half .
FROST-1840-1,181.857

Perhaps not a quarter ? FROST-1840-1,181.858

- I can@ @not say . FROST-1840-1,181.859

<heading>

<font> Cross-examined on the <$$font> Voir-dire . FROST-1840-1,181.861

<$$heading>

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> The new borough , I understand
, extends beyond the place where this man lives ? FROST-1840-1,181.863

- Yes ; in one direction it extends , perhaps , half a mile beyond .
FROST-1840-1,181.864

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Now , my Lord , I will just call your
Lordship's attention to the other point , for which I think one of your
Lordships desired to see the Boundary Act ; FROST-1840-1,181.865

that is an Act " to settle and describe the divisions of counties , and
the limits of boroughs , in so far as respects the election of Members
to serve in Parliament ; " FROST-1840-1,181.866

therefore , that Act , I presume , does not extend to the borough of
Newport for any other purposes . FROST-1840-1,181.867

The question then is , whether the description , " Samuel Simmons , of
the parish of St. Woollos , in the borough of Newport , in the county
of Monmouth , labourer , " is a good description . FROST-1840-1,181.868

Now , we are entitled , my Lord , to have the name -
FROST-1840-1,181.869

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> " The name , profession ,
and place of abode , " are the words of the statute .
FROST-1840-1,181.870

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Yes , my Lord ; FROST-1840-1,181.871

and to say that he resides in the parish of St. Woollos , in the
borough of Newport , appears to me to be a mis-description :
FROST-1840-1,181.872

it should be , " in the borough of Newport , in the parish of St.
Woollos ; " because the borough of Newport is a part of the parish , and
is in the parish ; FROST-1840-1,181.873

but the parish of St. Woollos is not in the borough of Newport ,
FROST-1840-1,181.874

there is only a part of it in the borough ; FROST-1840-1,181.875

and if the borough of Newport <P_182> is only a part of the parish of
St. Woollos , and no part of the borough of Newport is in any other
parish , it does seem very absurd - FROST-1840-1,182.876

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> If it be material , there is
part of the borough of Newport in another parish . FROST-1840-1,182.877

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> No , not of the old borough ;
FROST-1840-1,182.878

and I submit that this must be taken to be not the new , but the old
borough . FROST-1840-1,182.879

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> He is living in the borough
of Newport ; that is , every man who was acquainted with his place of
abode would say it was in the borough . FROST-1840-1,182.880

If it had been out of the new borough of Newport , and only in the old
borough , then your objection would have been the other way , that it
was not what was popularly known as the borough of Newport .
FROST-1840-1,182.881

Every information is given by this description . FROST-1840-1,182.882

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Now , my Lord , allow me to ask ,
whether in a parish like the parish of Lambeth , it would be sufficient
to say that a person was residing in that parish , or that he was
residing in the parish of Marylebone . FROST-1840-1,182.883

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Here are two descriptions
given : FROST-1840-1,182.884

he is residing in the borough , FROST-1840-1,182.885

and he is residing in that part of the parish which is also in the
borough . FROST-1840-1,182.886

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> It is perfectly true that he lives
in the parish of St. Woollos , FROST-1840-1,182.887

and he also lives in the borough of Newport ; at all events according to
the common boundaries . FROST-1840-1,182.888

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> The moment your Lordship decides that
the new borough is sufficient , I , of course , abandon the objection ,
that this description must have reference to the old borough .
FROST-1840-1,182.889

But I would ask your Lordship this : FROST-1840-1,182.890

I believe there is a part of the parish of Lambeth in the borough of
Southwark , FROST-1840-1,182.891

would it do to say , " of the parish of Lambeth , in the borough of
Southwark , " because a party lived in a portion of the borough of
Southwark , that was also in the parish of Lambeth ?
FROST-1840-1,182.892

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> That would be the same case
, would it not ? FROST-1840-1,182.893

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Yes , my Lord , it would .
FROST-1840-1,182.894

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Now you are upon the point
that there is no street named ? FROST-1840-1,182.895

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I am , my Lord , upon that point ,
that there is no information given beyond the parish , so as to enable
any person to find where the witness is to be met with .
FROST-1840-1,182.896

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> The man says there is no
name to the street where he lives , FROST-1840-1,182.897

but it is by the side of a tram-road that leads up to the hills ; so
that upon inquiry you would find him out . FROST-1840-1,182.898

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Does your Lordship call upon us
to answer this objection ? FROST-1840-1,187.906

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Is there not a case upon this
subject where the description was applied to Lambeth ?
FROST-1840-1,187.907

<P_188>

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> I am not aware of that ;
FROST-1840-1,188.909

the practice has been to describe the witnesses by the parish , as I am
informed by Mr. Maule . FROST-1840-1,188.910

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Your Lordships will not take my learned
friend's statement of the practice . FROST-1840-1,188.911

I can@ @not believe that there is any such practice .
FROST-1840-1,188.912

Before the Attorney-general begins , your Lordships will pardon me for
referring to a case in which an attorney , whose address must be given
under the statute of George II. , called himself of " New Inn , London
. " FROST-1840-1,188.913

That was a mere technical mistake , which could mislead no one ;
FROST-1840-1,188.914

but we all know that New Inn is in the city of Westminster .
FROST-1840-1,188.915

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> That was not a want of
certainty . FROST-1840-1,188.916

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> No , my Lord ; FROST-1840-1,188.917

I have referred to that as bearing upon the first part of the argument .
FROST-1840-1,188.918

Mr. <font> Wightman . <$$font> In Stone's case , my Lord , in 6th Term
Reports , an objection was made on the ground of the uncertainty of the
description of one of the jurymen ; FROST-1840-1,188.919

his place of abode was stated to be Grafton-street ;
FROST-1840-1,188.920

and it was contended , that as there are several streets of that name ,
there should have been something to distinguish which Grafton-street was
meant ; FROST-1840-1,188.921

but the objection was overruled . FROST-1840-1,188.922

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> There the street was named .
FROST-1840-1,188.923

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Under the statute to which my
learned friend has referred , requiring the place of abode of the
attorney to be stated , your Lordship is aware that it has been held
that it is enough to state the town in which he resides , and that too
in the case of the town of Birmingham , consisting of 30,000 inhabitants
. FROST-1840-1,188.924

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> The objection in this case
shapes itself in a double form ; first , that this is a mis-description
; and secondly , that there is a want of certainty in it .
FROST-1840-1,188.925

Now the description given in this list is , that Samuel Simmons , to
whom the objection applies , is " of the parish of St. Woollos , in the
borough of Newport , in the county of Monmouth . " FROST-1840-1,188.926

It appears to me , that this is true in every part and particular which
is set down in this list . FROST-1840-1,188.927

He is a resident in the parish of St. Woollos , in the borough of
Newport , in the county of Monmouth . FROST-1840-1,188.928

There was no intention to enter into any detail as to how much of the
parish of St. Woollos is in the borough of Newport , or how much out of
it , but merely to give such a description as should be true in matter
of fact , the statute saying , that there shall be given to the prisoner
" the name , profession and place of abode of the jurors and witnesses "
in the case . FROST-1840-1,188.929

The second objection is , that this is a bad description , on the ground
of its being too general . FROST-1840-1,188.930

In the first place it is to be observed , if the parish of St. Woollos
is larger than the borough of Newport , inasmuch as it is shown that he
lives in that part of the parish of St. Woollos which is in the borough
of Newport , you may reject altogether that part of the parish that is
out of the <P_189> borough ; FROST-1840-1,189.931

and , therefore , the only question is whether the description of a man
living in the borough of Newport is sufficient or not .
FROST-1840-1,189.932

It is observable , that the statute which first gives to the prisoner
the advantage of having the names of the witnesses , and their
professions and places of abode , couples in the same words the name ,
profession and place of abode of the witnesses and jurors .
FROST-1840-1,189.933

Now , upon looking at the panel of the jury , I find that every juror is
returned , not as of a particular street , but generally , of the town
or parish where his abode is . FROST-1840-1,189.934

For instance , " Avery , of Monmouth , gentleman ; Andrews , of
Abergavenny , ironmonger ; Ball , of Chepstow , victualler ; " and so on
throughout ; none , indeed , being from Newport , because the sheriff ,
for a very obvious reason , thought it better not to summon any from
that place ; FROST-1840-1,189.935

and it seems to me , that if we should say that this was a void
description of the witness on the ground of uncertainty , we must
equally say so with respect to every juryman summoned .
FROST-1840-1,189.936

They stand in the same predicament . FROST-1840-1,189.937

On these grounds , I think , that both the objections which have been
raised must be overruled . FROST-1840-1,189.938

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> I am of the same opinion with my
Lord_Chief_Justice upon both these points . FROST-1840-1,189.939

With respect to misdescription , that appears to me to be entirely out
of the question . FROST-1840-1,189.940

The description of the place of abode of the witness is perfectly
accurate ; FROST-1840-1,189.941

he does live in the parish of St. Woollos , FROST-1840-1,189.942

and he does live in the borough of Newport , FROST-1840-1,189.943

and there is nothing like an allegation that the whole of the parish is
in the borough . FROST-1840-1,189.944

And as to the sufficiency of the description , it appears to me to be
enough , especially in analogy to the case cited by the Attorney-general
, where the town is described as the place of abode .
FROST-1840-1,189.945

Mr. Justice <font> Williams . <$$font> I should have thought that this
was a more favourable description of the witness than if the parish were
given generally . FROST-1840-1,189.946

If it were " the parish of St. Woollos , " that would comprehend a
larger surface ; FROST-1840-1,189.947

but it is merely that part of the parish which is in the borough of
Newport ; FROST-1840-1,189.948

and , consequently , that limits and confines the inquiry to a smaller
space than if the parish had been given generally .
FROST-1840-1,189.949

With regard to the other point , the sufficiency of the description , I
observed that much inquiry was made of the witness as to whether the lot
of houses there had any definite name . FROST-1840-1,189.950

If it had appeared that that lot of 10 or 12 houses had acquired a
definite and definitive name , by possibility there might be some ground
for contending that this was too general a description , because more
might have been given ; FROST-1840-1,189.951

but nothing of that sort is applicable to this case .
FROST-1840-1,189.952

It appears that this is the course constantly pursued with regard to
those returned by the sheriff to serve upon the jury ,
FROST-1840-1,189.953

and I am of opinion , that it is a sufficient description ;
FROST-1840-1,189.954

certainly it is no mis-description . FROST-1840-1,189.955

Describe it ? FROST-1840-1,191.1053

- It appeared to be a sort of loose wrapper , a red handkerchief .
FROST-1840-1,191.1054

Have you ever heard that description of handkerchief called by any name
? FROST-1840-1,191.1055

- Yes ; I have heard them called by several names ,
FROST-1840-1,191.1056

a weather handkerchief , they call them ; one that would be likely to be
worn over another . FROST-1840-1,191.1057

- Almost instantaneously after I had seen Mr. Frost , I heard the
firing . FROST-1840-1,191.1063

were you on duty as a special constable that morning ?
FROST-1840-1,191.1065

- Not on any specific duty , further than that I had to keep watch .

Were you there to keep the peace as a special constable ?
FROST-1840-1,191.1067

- Certainly . FROST-1840-1,191.1068

<P_192>

And a centre ? FROST-1840-1,192.1076

- And a centre . FROST-1840-1,192.1077

What part of the room were you in ? FROST-1840-1,192.1078

- I should imagine it is the west end ; FROST-1840-1,192.1079

it is the end immediately fronting the portico of the mayor's house .
FROST-1840-1,192.1080

Is that the corner of the Westgate Inn , as you come down Stowe-hill ?
FROST-1840-1,192.1081

- It is . FROST-1840-1,192.1082

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> The commercial room is a bow-window
room ? FROST-1840-1,192.1083

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> The bow-window near the

Were you alone in that room , FROST-1840-1,192.1087

- I can@ @not speak to my own knowledge of more than one being in the
room ; FROST-1840-1,192.1089

but I believe there were one or two besides . FROST-1840-1,192.1090

At what time had you gone out with a view of keeping the peace , in this
place , as special constable ? FROST-1840-1,192.1091

- I had returned to Newport about 11 o'clock the previous night ,
FROST-1840-1,192.1092

and on my arrival there I heard - FROST-1840-1,192.1093

Never mind what you heard . FROST-1840-1,192.1094

- The special constables were being sworn in , FROST-1840-1,192.1095

and I went up to the Westgate , to offer my service .
FROST-1840-1,192.1096

Did you remain out all night ? FROST-1840-1,192.1097

- I did ; that is , I remained from home all night .
FROST-1840-1,192.1098

Did you remain out , with a view to keep the peace of the town , all
night ? FROST-1840-1,192.1099

- I did . FROST-1840-1,192.1100

Were you during the night at one place , or at different parts of the
town ? FROST-1840-1,192.1101

- At different parts of the town . FROST-1840-1,192.1102

How early in the morning had you first gone to the Westgate Inn ?
FROST-1840-1,192.1103

- I had visited the Westgate in the middle of the night .
FROST-1840-1,192.1104

How long had you been at the Westgate Inn that morning , before you saw
Mr. Frost , as you have stated ? FROST-1840-1,192.1105

- I should imagine about 20 minutes ; FROST-1840-1,192.1106

I have no particular data . FROST-1840-1,192.1107

That is near enough . FROST-1840-1,192.1108

Had you seen this company of persons , as you describe them , before you
saw them in front of the Westgate ? FROST-1840-1,192.1109

- Decidedly not . FROST-1840-1,192.1110

You did not see , then , from what direction they came ?
FROST-1840-1,192.1111

- Down Stowe-hill . FROST-1840-1,192.1112

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Did you see that ?
FROST-1840-1,192.1113

- I saw that . FROST-1840-1,192.1114

Through the bow-window ? FROST-1840-1,192.1115

- Through the bow-window . FROST-1840-1,192.1116

It should be stated , that the shutters of the window when I went
<P_193> into the room were closed , FROST-1840-1,193.1117

and it was mere curiosity , in fact , that induced me to go to the
commercial-room ; FROST-1840-1,193.1118

and I opened one of the ledges of the window , when , upon doing so , I
saw this immense multitude of people coming down the hill .
FROST-1840-1,193.1119

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> And when they came down the
hill , in what direction did they go to the front ?
FROST-1840-1,193.1120

- They immediately wheeled round . FROST-1840-1,193.1121

How long did you remain in the commercial-room after you saw them
through the window ? FROST-1840-1,193.1122

- A very few seconds . FROST-1840-1,193.1123

Where did you go then ? FROST-1840-1,193.1124

- I remained in the room as long as I considered it was safe remaining
there ; FROST-1840-1,193.1125

and on leaving the room and going into the passage , where I might have
got into the back-yard , I found that the only door through which I
could have gone was blockaded . FROST-1840-1,193.1126

Blockaded by whom ? FROST-1840-1,193.1127

- By the same men . FROST-1840-1,193.1128

You found the back door blockaded by a part of these men ?
FROST-1840-1,193.1129

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,193.1130

What did you do , FROST-1840-1,193.1131

or where did you go , when you found that door blockaded ?
FROST-1840-1,193.1132

- I had but one place to go to , FROST-1840-1,193.1133

and that was up stairs . FROST-1840-1,193.1134

Did you go up stairs ? FROST-1840-1,193.1135

- I did . FROST-1840-1,193.1136

Where were you when you saw Mr. Frost on the pavement as you have
described ? FROST-1840-1,193.1137

- In the commercial-room , previous to my leaving it .
FROST-1840-1,193.1138

Does any part of the window look across the front of the Westgate Inn ?
FROST-1840-1,193.1139

- It does , a portion of the bow-window . FROST-1840-1,193.1140

There is a window that looks across the front , FROST-1840-1,193.1141

is that towards Commercial-street ? FROST-1840-1,193.1142

- I rather think they term it Westgate-street ; FROST-1840-1,193.1143

if I had the plan I could explain . FROST-1840-1,193.1144

<bracket> <font> The plan was handed to the witness . <$$font>
<$$bracket> FROST-1840-1,193.1145

It is Westgate-street . FROST-1840-1,193.1146

Is the street immediately in front of the Westgate called
Westgate-street ? FROST-1840-1,193.1147

- I believe it is . FROST-1840-1,193.1148

Is that a continuation of the lane , part of which is called
Commercial-street ? FROST-1840-1,193.1149

- It is . FROST-1840-1,193.1150

And does that lane continue to the High-street ? FROST-1840-1,193.1151

- It does . FROST-1840-1,193.1152

Inclining to the right ? FROST-1840-1,193.1153

- Inclining to the right . FROST-1840-1,193.1154

How soon after you saw this company of persons coming down Stowe-hill ,
you being in the commercial-room , did you hear the firing , as near as
you can speak ? FROST-1840-1,193.1155

- The time was very short - FROST-1840-1,193.1156

it is hardly calculable FROST-1840-1,193.1157

- I should say immediately ; FROST-1840-1,193.1158

when I say firing , really the noise and din of breaking in the windows
in the room where I was was so great , that although firing actually
occurred , I could not distinctly swear that I heard any firing at all .
FROST-1840-1,193.1159

Did you see any smoke ? FROST-1840-1,193.1160

- I did not . FROST-1840-1,193.1161

You say there was a noise of breaking in the windows of the
commercial-room ? FROST-1840-1,193.1162

- I do . FROST-1840-1,193.1163

<P_194>

Did that take place before or after you left the commercial-room ?
FROST-1840-1,194.1165

- Before . FROST-1840-1,194.1166

Who were the persons that were breaking in those windows ?
FROST-1840-1,194.1167

- The men that I had immediately before seen coming down the hill .
FROST-1840-1,194.1168

In what manner were they breaking in the windows ?
FROST-1840-1,194.1169

- With various sorts of weapons . FROST-1840-1,194.1170

Just describe them - FROST-1840-1,194.1171

pikes ? FROST-1840-1,194.1172

- Pikes and mandrils . FROST-1840-1,194.1173

Is a mandril an instrument something like a pick-axe ?
FROST-1840-1,194.1174

- It is . FROST-1840-1,194.1175

Are the points like those of ordinary pick-axes ? FROST-1840-1,194.1176

- Yes ; a point and a broad edge ; FROST-1840-1,194.1177

there were various sorts of weapons , FROST-1840-1,194.1178

I can hardly describe them , they were so varied .
FROST-1840-1,194.1179

You said that you remained in the commercial-room as long as you thought
it safe , FROST-1840-1,194.1180

did you quit it before those persons began to break in the windows , or
after ? FROST-1840-1,194.1181

- After . FROST-1840-1,194.1182

Then you went up stairs ; FROST-1840-1,194.1183

how long did you remain up stairs ? FROST-1840-1,194.1184

- During the whole of the firing . FROST-1840-1,194.1185

How many minutes , or what portion of time do you give to that ?
FROST-1840-1,194.1186

- I have always supposed that it lasted about six or seven minutes ;
FROST-1840-1,194.1187

I calculate that . FROST-1840-1,194.1188

I think you said you could not distinctly swear that you heard firing ?
FROST-1840-1,194.1189

- I should be sorry to say positively . FROST-1840-1,194.1190

Does that apply to the whole time , or to any part of the time ?
FROST-1840-1,194.1191

- During the time of breaking in the windows . FROST-1840-1,194.1192

When you got up stairs , are you enabled to say whether there was firing
or not ? FROST-1840-1,194.1193

- Oh dear , yes , some hundred volleys , I should think .
FROST-1840-1,194.1194

Are you enabled to say , from your own observation , whether the firing
came from the persons you saw coming round in the manner you have
described ? FROST-1840-1,194.1195

- I have no doubt that the firing came from them , FROST-1840-1,194.1196

but I can@ @not say so of my own personal observation .
FROST-1840-1,194.1197

Did you see any guns ? FROST-1840-1,194.1198

- I did , in the crowd . FROST-1840-1,194.1199

Were you enabled to see , in going up stairs , whether those guns were
discharged , or any of them ? FROST-1840-1,194.1200

- I was not in front of the house , FROST-1840-1,194.1201

and therefore could not see them . FROST-1840-1,194.1202

While up stairs did you hear firing ? FROST-1840-1,194.1203

- I did . FROST-1840-1,194.1204

For about seven minutes ? FROST-1840-1,194.1205

- I should imagine about seven minutes . FROST-1840-1,194.1206

I think you say while up stairs you were not in front of the house ?
FROST-1840-1,194.1207

- I was in one of the back bed-rooms . FROST-1840-1,194.1208

What number of persons did you find in the passage when the door was
blockaded as you have described ? FROST-1840-1,194.1209

- That portion of the passage was quite full between the door and the
room in which the soldiers were , and between that and the entrance to
the house . FROST-1840-1,194.1210

Is the entrance to the house in the middle of the house ?
FROST-1840-1,194.1211

- It is . FROST-1840-1,194.1212

<P_195>

Suppose you enter from the front of the house , FROST-1840-1,195.1214

if you turn to the right , does that lead to the commercial-room ?
FROST-1840-1,195.1215

- It does . FROST-1840-1,195.1216

If you turn to the left , where does that lead to ?
FROST-1840-1,195.1217

- It leads into the room where the soldiers were .
FROST-1840-1,195.1218

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Down stairs ?
FROST-1840-1,195.1219

- Down stairs , my Lord . FROST-1840-1,195.1220

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> The house has two bows ?
FROST-1840-1,195.1221

- It has . FROST-1840-1,195.1222

That room is one of the bow-windowed rooms , FROST-1840-1,195.1223

and is the room in which the soldiers were ? FROST-1840-1,195.1224

- It is . FROST-1840-1,195.1225

Is that the corresponding end of the house to the commercial-room at the
other end ? FROST-1840-1,195.1226

- It is . FROST-1840-1,195.1227

And , you say , the space from the door to the room where the soldiers
were was full of men ? FROST-1840-1,195.1228

- From the entrance-hall to the room where the soldiers were , as far as
I could see of the passage , it appeared to be quite full of men .
FROST-1840-1,195.1229

Did you see whether those men had arms of any description ?
FROST-1840-1,195.1230

- They had . FROST-1840-1,195.1231

What had they ? FROST-1840-1,195.1232

- I distinctly saw one person with a weapon something like a pike I
should imagine , deliberately breaking the windows of the bar ,
FROST-1840-1,195.1233

he was the nearest to me ; FROST-1840-1,195.1234

as to the weapons of the others , the time was so short , that I should
be sorry to say what they were . FROST-1840-1,195.1235

You say you stood in the commercial-room as long as you thought it safe
; FROST-1840-1,195.1236

did you go immediately from that room up stairs ? FROST-1840-1,195.1237

- I did , inasmuch as there was no egress to the back_yard , the door
being blockaded , as I have described . FROST-1840-1,195.1238

How soon did you quit that back room into which you went up stairs ?
FROST-1840-1,195.1239

- After I heard the firing cease . FROST-1840-1,195.1240

Did you come down stairs ? FROST-1840-1,195.1241

- - I did . FROST-1840-1,195.1242

Did you find any dead bodies ? FROST-1840-1,195.1243

- I saw several in the house , dead and dying . FROST-1840-1,195.1244

Had you seen any of those persons before you went up , dead or alive ?
FROST-1840-1,195.1245

- Not an individual , that I am aware of . FROST-1840-1,195.1246

Then , they met their death while you were up stairs ?
FROST-1840-1,195.1247

- Exactly . FROST-1840-1,195.1248

Had you an opportunity of seeing whether there were any dead or dying
persons outside the door ? FROST-1840-1,195.1249

- I had . FROST-1840-1,195.1250

Were there any ? FROST-1840-1,195.1251

- There were . FROST-1840-1,195.1252

How many ? FROST-1840-1,195.1253

- Four ; three dead and one dying . FROST-1840-1,195.1254

When you came out , what was the state of that company of persons that
you had seen in front ; FROST-1840-1,195.1255

were they there in the same number , or less , FROST-1840-1,195.1256

or were they all gone ? FROST-1840-1,195.1257

- They were dispersed . FROST-1840-1,195.1258

Entirely ? FROST-1840-1,195.1259

- No , I should say not entirely : FROST-1840-1,195.1260

they were hanging on the skirts and corners of the streets .
FROST-1840-1,195.1261

At the time you saw Mr. Frost where you have described , was there any
person near you , that you spoke to - FROST-1840-1,195.1262

I do not ask what you said ? FROST-1840-1,195.1263

- There was . FROST-1840-1,195.1264

<P_196>

What was his name ? FROST-1840-1,196.1266

- Thomas Latch . FROST-1840-1,196.1267

How soon was the assemblage entirely dispersed - FROST-1840-1,196.1268

I do not ask to minutes - FROST-1840-1,196.1269

was it half an hour , or an hour ? FROST-1840-1,196.1270

- When I came from up stairs to the front of the house the parties had
dispersed , FROST-1840-1,196.1271

and the square , the immediate front of the Westgate , was vacant ;
FROST-1840-1,196.1272

it was completely empty . FROST-1840-1,196.1273

Had you seen the soldiers go into the room where you have described them
as being ? FROST-1840-1,196.1274

- I came from the barracks with them . FROST-1840-1,196.1275

Can you tell me the number of soldiers ? FROST-1840-1,196.1276

- About 30 . FROST-1840-1,196.1277

And they had gone into that room ? FROST-1840-1,196.1278

- They had . FROST-1840-1,196.1279

How long had they been there before this transaction occurred that you
have spoken of ? FROST-1840-1,196.1280

- About the same time that I had been ; FROST-1840-1,196.1281

I came down with them . FROST-1840-1,196.1282

Did you say what time - FROST-1840-1,196.1283

about what time had you been with the soldiers before this assemblage
arrived ? FROST-1840-1,196.1284

- Well , I should imagine about 20 minutes . FROST-1840-1,196.1285

Can you tell me whether the shutters of that room were open , so that
the soldiers could be seen in the room , or whether they were closed ?
FROST-1840-1,196.1286

- I believe they were closed . FROST-1840-1,196.1287

Did you look ? FROST-1840-1,196.1288

- I can@ @not swear to that , of my own knowledge .
FROST-1840-1,196.1289

<heading>

<font> Cross-examined by Sir F. Pollock . <$$font>
FROST-1840-1,196.1291

<$$heading>

You say you have known Mr. Frost all your life-time , from your infancy
? FROST-1840-1,196.1293

- From my infancy , I have . FROST-1840-1,196.1294

Of course , then , I presume , you have yourself lived at Newport all
your life ? FROST-1840-1,196.1295

- No , I have not . FROST-1840-1,196.1296

More or less ? FROST-1840-1,196.1297

- More or less , I have lived in Newport and its immediate neighbourhood
. FROST-1840-1,196.1298

You have known the place ever since you were born ?
FROST-1840-1,196.1299

- I have been in the constant habit of visiting the place .
FROST-1840-1,196.1300

How long have you been in practice as an attorney ?
FROST-1840-1,196.1301

- Three years . FROST-1840-1,196.1302

I dare say you know that Mr. Frost was mayor of Newport ?
FROST-1840-1,196.1303

- I do . FROST-1840-1,196.1304

Perhaps more than once ? FROST-1840-1,196.1305

- I am not aware that he was mayor more than once .
FROST-1840-1,196.1306

In what year was he mayor ? FROST-1840-1,196.1307

- I should think it must have been in 1836 ; FROST-1840-1,196.1308

I fancy so . FROST-1840-1,196.1309

I dare say you personally know that he was a magistrate ?
FROST-1840-1,196.1310

- I know it personally . FROST-1840-1,196.1311

Do you know how long he was a magistrate - several years ?
FROST-1840-1,196.1312

- He was a magistrate , I believe , for three or four years .
FROST-1840-1,196.1313

That would be several ? FROST-1840-1,196.1314

- Exactly . FROST-1840-1,196.1315

A very active magistrate , was he not ? FROST-1840-1,196.1316

- I believe so . FROST-1840-1,196.1317

If you do know it , I would ask you whether he was not a <P_197> very
active and conscientious magistrate ? FROST-1840-1,197.1318

- For any thing that I know to the contrary . FROST-1840-1,197.1319

You say you went to the room up stairs ? FROST-1840-1,197.1320

- I did . FROST-1840-1,197.1321

That was at the back of the house ? FROST-1840-1,197.1322

- It was . FROST-1840-1,197.1323

You did not see any thing of what took place after you got there ?
FROST-1840-1,197.1324

- Certainly not . FROST-1840-1,197.1325

Now , you say that you came down with some soldiers about 20 minutes
before ? FROST-1840-1,197.1326

- I came down with them ; FROST-1840-1,197.1327

I really can@ @not tell the exact time , FROST-1840-1,197.1328

I have no means of calculating it ; FROST-1840-1,197.1329

it might have been 20 minutes , FROST-1840-1,197.1330

or it might have been half an hour . FROST-1840-1,197.1331

Do not understand me as pressing you upon the subject ;
FROST-1840-1,197.1332

I ask you whether it was 20 minutes or half an hour ?
FROST-1840-1,197.1333

- A very short time had elapsed . FROST-1840-1,197.1334

Where did you go to fetch them ? FROST-1840-1,197.1335

- I did not go to fetch them ; FROST-1840-1,197.1336

I happened to be there at the time when information came that they were
to go down . FROST-1840-1,197.1337

You say you had come down with the soldiers ; FROST-1840-1,197.1338

where did you meet them ? FROST-1840-1,197.1339

- At the barracks ; FROST-1840-1,197.1340

I happened to be at the barracks when they were ordered to go down .
FROST-1840-1,197.1341

That is an answer ; FROST-1840-1,197.1342

do you see at that distance enough to tell me whether that is the
barracks , the union poor-house ? FROST-1840-1,197.1343

- <bracket> <font> Pointing out the same upon the plan . <$$font>
<$$bracket> FROST-1840-1,197.1344

- It is . FROST-1840-1,197.1345

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> Just mark a small dot at that
spot . FROST-1840-1,197.1346

<bracket> <font> The witness marked the plan . <$$font> <$$bracket>
FROST-1840-1,197.1347

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> This is the union poor-house ,
which was used as barracks ? FROST-1840-1,197.1348

- A portion of which was used as barracks . FROST-1840-1,197.1349

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> Were there any persons that Sunday
night in custody at the Westgate Inn ? FROST-1840-1,197.1350

- There were , though I did not see them in custody myself .
FROST-1840-1,197.1351

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Which night ? FROST-1840-1,197.1352

- The Sunday night , my Lord . FROST-1840-1,197.1353

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Between the Sunday and
Monday ? FROST-1840-1,197.1354

- Between the Sunday and Monday , my Lord . FROST-1840-1,197.1355

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> You say you did not see them ?
FROST-1840-1,197.1356

- I did not see them . FROST-1840-1,197.1357

You mean , you did not see them in custody ? FROST-1840-1,197.1358

- I did not . FROST-1840-1,197.1359

Did you see any of them come there ? FROST-1840-1,197.1360

- No . FROST-1840-1,197.1361

How do you know they were there ? FROST-1840-1,197.1362

- I merely tell you , from hearing it at the time , that parties had
been taken to the Westgate ; FROST-1840-1,197.1363

I had no curiosity to see them myself . FROST-1840-1,197.1364

Was there any part of the Westgate Inn that was appropriated to the
reception of persons in custody ? FROST-1840-1,197.1365

- There was . FROST-1840-1,197.1366

Whereabouts was that ? FROST-1840-1,197.1367

- Between the entrance-hall and the room where the soldiers were
stationed , on the left-hand side as you enter . FROST-1840-1,197.1368

A small room , between the bow window and the door ?
FROST-1840-1,197.1369

- Exactly . FROST-1840-1,197.1370

<P_198>

And in front ? FROST-1840-1,198.1372

- In front ; FROST-1840-1,198.1373

that is the answer to the question as to whether a certain portion of
the house was allotted to prisoners ; FROST-1840-1,198.1374

I do not mean to say that it was on Sunday night , because that I can@
@not speak to ; FROST-1840-1,198.1375

but on Monday night it was . FROST-1840-1,198.1376

You say there were persons in custody on Sunday night ;
FROST-1840-1,198.1377

where were they ? FROST-1840-1,198.1378

- I say , that I do not of my own knowledge know that they were in
custody , FROST-1840-1,198.1379

but I know it to be so , inasmuch as it was the current report of the
town . FROST-1840-1,198.1380

How early in the evening did you hear it ? FROST-1840-1,198.1381

- I should imagine about 12 o'clock . FROST-1840-1,198.1382

In the day ? FROST-1840-1,198.1383

- No , in the night . FROST-1840-1,198.1384

Did you yourself assist in taking any body there ?
FROST-1840-1,198.1385

- I did not . FROST-1840-1,198.1386

Nor see any body else assist ? FROST-1840-1,198.1387

- I did not . FROST-1840-1,198.1388

Do you know on that Sunday night in what part of the house those persons
were ? FROST-1840-1,198.1389

- No , I can@ @not say , except that that room was allotted for the
purpose on the Monday . FROST-1840-1,198.1390

Did you then know it ? FROST-1840-1,198.1391

- I did know it . FROST-1840-1,198.1392

Though you did not see any person in custody on Sunday night , you might
know that there was a room appropriated for persons in custody ?
FROST-1840-1,198.1393

- I believe there were persons in custody on that Sunday night .
FROST-1840-1,198.1394

You heard it about 12 o'clock ? FROST-1840-1,198.1395

- It was the middle of the night . FROST-1840-1,198.1396

It was the current report all night , long before the main body came to
the town , that they were taking them up one by one .
FROST-1840-1,198.1397

Had you not instructions to take persons up , as a special constable ?
FROST-1840-1,198.1398

- My general instructions were such ; FROST-1840-1,198.1399

but I had no instructions that night . FROST-1840-1,198.1400

What were your general instructions ? FROST-1840-1,198.1401

- Merely to perform the duties of special constable ; nothing more than
that . FROST-1840-1,198.1402

Had you any directions to arrest any persons ? FROST-1840-1,198.1403

- I had not . FROST-1840-1,198.1404

Were there no directions to you , that if any persons were found
straggling , they should be arrested ? FROST-1840-1,198.1405

- No , I did not come into the town till 12 o'clock that night , when
most of the special constables had received their orders .
FROST-1840-1,198.1406

Do you know a person of the name of Vincent , of Newport ?
FROST-1840-1,198.1407

- I know him by common report , and from having seen him latterly ;
FROST-1840-1,198.1408

I know him , also , personally . FROST-1840-1,198.1409

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> He had no personal
acquaintance , FROST-1840-1,198.1410

but he knows him by sight . FROST-1840-1,198.1411

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> He was a shopkeeper in the town ?
FROST-1840-1,198.1412

- Not that I am aware of . FROST-1840-1,198.1413

Do you know any thing about him ? FROST-1840-1,198.1414

- Nothing more than that he made several public speeches in Newport ;
and also purported to be an author and publisher .
FROST-1840-1,198.1415

Were they public speeches made at public meetings ?
FROST-1840-1,198.1416

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,198.1417

<P_199>

Do you know that he was in custody at that time in Monmouth ?
FROST-1840-1,199.1419

- I do . FROST-1840-1,199.1420

On the Sunday night did you know that Vincent was in custody ?
FROST-1840-1,199.1421

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,199.1422

I believe here , at Monmouth ? FROST-1840-1,199.1423

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,199.1424

Do you know , yourself , whether there had been any applications made to
the magistrates upon the subject of Vincent , and his mode of being
treated in the gaol ? FROST-1840-1,199.1425

- Of my own knowledge , I do not ; FROST-1840-1,199.1426

further than that I have seen letters , I believe , signed by Mr. Frost
himself , in which he states - FROST-1840-1,199.1427

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> No , stop .
FROST-1840-1,199.1428

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I do not ask the contents of the
letters written by Mr. Frost ; FROST-1840-1,199.1429

but I want to know whether there had not been a general talk in Newport
of Vincent being in custody , and the mode in which he was treated ?
FROST-1840-1,199.1430

- No , I can@ @not say that I then knew any thing of that .
FROST-1840-1,199.1431

You say that you did not know that that was the subject of any general
conversation ? FROST-1840-1,199.1432

- I had learned that men of the same political opinions as himself were
- FROST-1840-1,199.1433

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> My Lord , I must object ;
FROST-1840-1,199.1434

we shall get very wide of the question by asking the witness what he
heard . FROST-1840-1,199.1435

He is now going to state something about political opinions , which will
lead to a very distracted inquiry . FROST-1840-1,199.1436

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> My Lord , I apprehend I have a
perfect right to ascertain whether such a report existed .
FROST-1840-1,199.1437

I am not proposing to prove the fact , that that report was well founded
; FROST-1840-1,199.1438

but I am proposing to prove that there were , as a matter of notoriety ,
general complaints , no matter by whom , of the treatment of a person of
the name of Vincent . FROST-1840-1,199.1439

Surely , my Lord , I have a right to do that . FROST-1840-1,199.1440

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> To what period are you
referring ? FROST-1840-1,199.1441

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> My Lord , I am referring to the time
previous to the period in question . FROST-1840-1,199.1442

I will not disguise from your Lordship my object - FROST-1840-1,199.1443

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> No , we do not want you to
tell your object . FROST-1840-1,199.1444

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I doubt , my Lord , whether I am
under any obligation to do that ; FROST-1840-1,199.1445

but your Lordship knows that the state of the country , the prevailing
public reports , and the general feeling of the public mind , are taken
to be evidence . FROST-1840-1,199.1446

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> I did not object to the

FROST-1840-1,199.1447

him . " FROST-1840-1,199.1450

<font> Witness . <$$font> That is the answer I would give .

up roughly , and others tolerably . FROST-1840-1,214.2255

About how many a-breast did they appear to you to come ?
FROST-1840-1,214.2256

- They appeared to come five a-breast . FROST-1840-1,214.2257

Could you observe whether there was any order in the weapons ?
FROST-1840-1,214.2258

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,214.2259

Could you observe that the parties who had particular weapons occupied
particular places in that body ? FROST-1840-1,214.2260

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,214.2261

What was it you observed in that respect ? FROST-1840-1,214.2262

- They seemed to be five a-breast , FROST-1840-1,214.2263

and one man of every other rank had a gun ; FROST-1840-1,214.2264

at least a person with a gun marched on the right-hand side of them ;
FROST-1840-1,214.2265

that was the near side to the Westgate ; FROST-1840-1,214.2266

the others were armed with pikes and those different instruments .
FROST-1840-1,214.2267

So that on the outside of each front rank was a man armed with a gun ?
FROST-1840-1,214.2268

- On the inside . FROST-1840-1,214.2269

On the right-hand leading to the corner ? FROST-1840-1,214.2270

- Yes ; FROST-1840-1,214.2271

I can@ @not say for certain that none of those fives in the middle had
guns , because I could not exactly see . FROST-1840-1,214.2272

But you could observe that , as far as you saw , those who were on the
right-hand side of every other rank had a gun ? FROST-1840-1,214.2273

- Yes ; FROST-1840-1,214.2274

so that there were ten , FROST-1840-1,214.2275

and then there was one man had a gun . FROST-1840-1,214.2276

Were you at that time standing by the door-post ? FROST-1840-1,214.2277

- I was . FROST-1840-1,214.2278

In what direction did this body which you have described <P_215> go ,
when they first wheeled round the corner ? FROST-1840-1,215.2279

- They went toward the yard gates . FROST-1840-1,215.2280

Were those gates at that time open or shut ? FROST-1840-1,215.2281

- I can@ @not tell . FROST-1840-1,215.2282

Did you yourself see any attempt made to get in there ?
FROST-1840-1,215.2283

- They seemed to go towards it ; FROST-1840-1,215.2284

I can@ @not say that they went to the gates then , because the angle of
the house would prevent me from seeing the gates .
FROST-1840-1,215.2285

All that you know is , that they seemed to go there in the first
instance ? FROST-1840-1,215.2286

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,215.2287

Do those gates lead into the court at the back part of the house ?
FROST-1840-1,215.2288

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,215.2289

Did you see a man named Walters there ? FROST-1840-1,215.2290

- I did . FROST-1840-1,215.2291

Did you observe what weapon Walters had ? FROST-1840-1,215.2292

- I did observe it . FROST-1840-1,215.2293

What weapon had he ? FROST-1840-1,215.2294

- A gun . FROST-1840-1,215.2295

Did you observe him as he passed the window do any thing ; make any
motion with the gun ? FROST-1840-1,215.2296

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,215.2297

What did you observe him do ? FROST-1840-1,215.2298

- He held it up in a threatening attitude with one hand , seemingly
pointing to some person in the window , FROST-1840-1,215.2299

but I can@ @not say whether there was any person there .
FROST-1840-1,215.2300

Now after you had seen the crowd go first toward those gates , did you
observe them change their direction ? FROST-1840-1,215.2301

- Yes ; at least they stopped ; FROST-1840-1,215.2302

they halted in front of the house . FROST-1840-1,215.2303

Did any of them come to the front door where you were stationed ?
FROST-1840-1,215.2304

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,215.2305

Can you at all tell what number it was that came up to the door ?
FROST-1840-1,215.2306

- No . FROST-1840-1,215.2307

How were those armed that came up to the door ? FROST-1840-1,215.2308

- The first was armed with a gun , who came to the door ;
FROST-1840-1,215.2309

there were some others who came armed with pikes ; FROST-1840-1,215.2310

they did not march up to the door , that is , not in order ;
FROST-1840-1,215.2311

they marched there , FROST-1840-1,215.2312

and then they came up to the door , not in order .
FROST-1840-1,215.2313

The door was not wide enough for them to march up to it ?
FROST-1840-1,215.2314

- About four feet wide . FROST-1840-1,215.2315

They marched up in order FROST-1840-1,215.2316

and halted , FROST-1840-1,215.2317

and then a party came not in order to the door , FROST-1840-1,215.2318

and halted ? FROST-1840-1,215.2319

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,215.2320

Did you hear either of the persons who so came up in that manner towards
the passage address any thing to the special constables ?
FROST-1840-1,215.2321

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,215.2322

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Was that the man with the
gun ? FROST-1840-1,215.2323

- Yes , my Lord . FROST-1840-1,215.2324

Mr. Serjeant <font> Talfourd . <$$font> What was it he said to the
special constables ? FROST-1840-1,215.2325

- He said , " Surrender yourselves our prisoners . "
FROST-1840-1,215.2326

Did you hear any answer made to that request ? FROST-1840-1,215.2327

- I did . FROST-1840-1,215.2328

From some one in the passage ? FROST-1840-1,215.2329

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,215.2330

What was it ? FROST-1840-1,215.2331

- " No , never ! " FROST-1840-1,215.2332

Upon that did the man with the gun do any thing with it ?
FROST-1840-1,215.2333

- He did . FROST-1840-1,215.2334

<P_216>

What did the man with the gun do ? FROST-1840-1,216.2336

- He levelled it at my head . FROST-1840-1,216.2337

What did you do upon that ? FROST-1840-1,216.2338

- I caught hold of the door FROST-1840-1,216.2339

and it struck the gun on one side , FROST-1840-1,216.2340

and the gun went off about three inches from my head ;
FROST-1840-1,216.2341

it stunned me . FROST-1840-1,216.2342

Did you hear any firing immediately after that ? FROST-1840-1,216.2343

- I did . FROST-1840-1,216.2344

Are you enabled to tell from whom that firing proceeded ?
FROST-1840-1,216.2345

- It came from the outside the first that I know of .
FROST-1840-1,216.2346

That you are sure of ? FROST-1840-1,216.2347

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,216.2348

After the firing , which you are sure came from the outside , did you
hear any other firing ? FROST-1840-1,216.2349

- I heard firing afterwards ; FROST-1840-1,216.2350

it lasted several minutes . FROST-1840-1,216.2351

What became of you during that firing ? FROST-1840-1,216.2352

- The men , when they rushed into the passage , pushed past me ,
FROST-1840-1,216.2353

and the smoke became so great that I could not tell one party from the
other in the passage . FROST-1840-1,216.2354

The smoke from what ? FROST-1840-1,216.2355

- From the firing ; FROST-1840-1,216.2356

I made my way through them ; FROST-1840-1,216.2357

I could not tell who they were ; FROST-1840-1,216.2358

and went out at the back door of the Westgate into the yard .
FROST-1840-1,216.2359

You say there was a good deal of smoke from the firing in the passage ;
FROST-1840-1,216.2360

could you at all form a judgment about how many persons there were
struggling in the passage ? FROST-1840-1,216.2361

- No ; it was crowded . FROST-1840-1,216.2362

Could you tell whether the persons in the passage were armed , generally

With what sort of weapons ? FROST-1840-1,216.2365

I went through the yard , and through the back way of some houses ,
FROST-1840-1,216.2373

and went home . FROST-1840-1,216.2374

You avoided the crowd in front altogether ? FROST-1840-1,216.2375

Did you return again to the Westgate that morning ?
FROST-1840-1,216.2377

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,216.2378

What was the reason you , as a special constable , went away from the
Westgate , and went home ? FROST-1840-1,216.2379

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> If it be a fact , my learned friend can
inquire into the fact , FROST-1840-1,216.2380

but I do not conceive the reason can be evidence .
FROST-1840-1,216.2381

Mr. Serjeant <font> Talfourd . <$$font> What induced you to go home ?
FROST-1840-1,216.2382

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Stay one moment ; FROST-1840-1,216.2383

I must take your Lordships' opinion whether the question can be put in
that form . FROST-1840-1,216.2384

If the object be to obtain the statement of a fact in answer , I submit
my learned friend is not entitled to put that question .
FROST-1840-1,216.2385

Mr. Serjeant <font> Talfourd . <$$font> I will not argue about it , if
there is any doubt . FROST-1840-1,216.2386

How long was it before you visited the Westgate Inn again on that
morning ? FROST-1840-1,217.2392

Do you mean to swear that ? FROST-1840-1,217.2413

Do you not know that your father has been on bad terms with him ?
FROST-1840-1,217.2415

- I do not . FROST-1840-1,217.2416

You never knew that at all ? FROST-1840-1,217.2417

Is your father here ? FROST-1840-1,217.2419

I have not seen him in Monmouth ; FROST-1840-1,217.2421

I left him on Monday morning . FROST-1840-1,217.2422

When was it that you were first made a special constable ?
FROST-1840-1,217.2423

- I think it was the 11th of May ; the 11th or 12th .
FROST-1840-1,217.2424

And have you constantly acted in that character since ?
FROST-1840-1,217.2425

- No , not until the riot ; FROST-1840-1,217.2426

I was called out on the Sunday night ; FROST-1840-1,217.2427

I was first called out then . FROST-1840-1,217.2428

You were called out on the Sunday night ? FROST-1840-1,217.2429

persons had been endeavouring to preserve the peace ?
FROST-1840-1,217.2435

- No , not of my own knowledge , FROST-1840-1,217.2436

Did you continue to act during the night ? FROST-1840-1,217.2438

- I did . FROST-1840-1,217.2439

The whole of the night ? FROST-1840-1,217.2440

Perhaps , then , you can tell me whether any persons had been taken into

- On Monday morning - at least it was after twelve on <P_218> Sunday
night - there had . FROST-1840-1,218.2443

I do not know of any being taken before twelve on Sunday night .

Only tell me of what you know yourself of your own knowledge .

At what time on Monday morning , that is , the night of Sunday , or the
Monday morning , did you know of any person having been taken into

- I believe the first to have been the first that I saw , about two or

In the course of the night , or before this riot took place on the
Monday morning , did you see any more that were taken into custody ?
FROST-1840-1,218.2448

- Oh , yes . FROST-1840-1,218.2449

They were , I believe , chartists , or what you call chartists ?
FROST-1840-1,218.2457

- They were taken as such . FROST-1840-1,218.2458

From various parts of the town , I suppose ? FROST-1840-1,218.2459

- I do not know of any but from one part . FROST-1840-1,218.2460

Or , as my learned friend suggests , the country , perhaps ?
FROST-1840-1,218.2461

- I did not see them taken . FROST-1840-1,218.2462

Then do not tell me any thing but what you know ; FROST-1840-1,218.2463

were they brought to the Westgate Inn ? FROST-1840-1,218.2465

Whereabouts is that room ? FROST-1840-1,218.2469

Can you tell me by what letter it is described on that groundplan ?

The one to the east ? FROST-1840-1,218.2476

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> The same room where the soldiers
were afterwards ? FROST-1840-1,218.2478

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,218.2479

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Were those persons kept somewhere or other
in the Westgate Inn in custody until the attack upon the house by the
mob ? FROST-1840-1,218.2480

- I saw them a little while before the attack upon the house by the mob
. FROST-1840-1,218.2481

I do not suppose you had your eye upon them the whole time .
FROST-1840-1,218.2482

- I believe them to have been in the house then . FROST-1840-1,218.2483

How long before the mob appeared before the house was it that you last
saw any of them ? FROST-1840-1,218.2484

- In the morning . FROST-1840-1,218.2487

What room were they in then ? FROST-1840-1,218.2488

- They were then in the room next to the long room .
FROST-1840-1,218.2489

Is that the small room which is marked G , between the passage and that
room ? FROST-1840-1,218.2490

- It is between the passage and the long room . FROST-1840-1,218.2491

<P_219>

Between the entrance and the soldier's room , as we call it ?
FROST-1840-1,219.2493

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,219.2494

You saw some of them in that room about six , FROST-1840-1,219.2495

and you have no reason to suppose that they afterwards left ?
FROST-1840-1,219.2496

- No ; FROST-1840-1,219.2497

it may have been between five and six . FROST-1840-1,219.2498

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Not in the great room ?
FROST-1840-1,219.2499

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> No , my Lord , but about six he saw them
in the room marked G , between the soldier's room and the entrance .
FROST-1840-1,219.2500

<bracket> <font> To the witness . <$$font> <$$bracket> You had been
there from six ; FROST-1840-1,219.2501

what were you doing with yourself from six , or whatever the time was ,

FROST-1840-1,219.2502

- About six I went out as far as the church . FROST-1840-1,219.2503

I do not want to know precisely where you went ; FROST-1840-1,219.2504

were you about the town ? FROST-1840-1,219.2505

- Yes ; and I went home FROST-1840-1,219.2506

and had my breakfast , FROST-1840-1,219.2507

and washed myself ; FROST-1840-1,219.2508

I felt tired , FROST-1840-1,219.2509

but I did not stay at home . FROST-1840-1,219.2510

Then you went back FROST-1840-1,219.2511

and placed yourself with other special constables in the entrance ?
FROST-1840-1,219.2512

- Yes , I was placed there . FROST-1840-1,219.2513

Now tell me as exactly as you can , to the best of your recollection ,
how soon after you returned there the soldiers came ?
FROST-1840-1,219.2514

- They were going into the house as I returned . FROST-1840-1,219.2515

I think you said that was about nine o'clock ? FROST-1840-1,219.2516

- I returned about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes before the firing
took place , before the row ; FROST-1840-1,219.2517

it must have been about nine ; FROST-1840-1,219.2518

but I can@ @not say the time . FROST-1840-1,219.2519

You went into the inn at the same time with the soldiers ,
FROST-1840-1,219.2520

and you had been in a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes before the firing
commenced ? FROST-1840-1,219.2521

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,219.2522

I thought I understood you to say it was 10 minutes or a quarter of an
hour , FROST-1840-1,219.2523

which would be the nearest ? FROST-1840-1,219.2524

- I should say it might be a quarter of an hour ; FROST-1840-1,219.2525

it may@ @be two or three minutes more or two or three minutes less .
FROST-1840-1,219.2526

As near as you can say , it would be about a quarter of an hour before
the firing commenced ? FROST-1840-1,219.2527

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,219.2528

During that quarter of an hour did you remain all the time in the
entrance ? FROST-1840-1,219.2529

- I did . FROST-1840-1,219.2530

Looking at the door ? FROST-1840-1,219.2531

- Looking at the outside of the door . I mean that , looking , in fact
, through the door-way ? FROST-1840-1,219.2532

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,219.2533

Were there several other persons besides yourself in the passage ?
FROST-1840-1,219.2534

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,219.2535

The door all the time remained open ? FROST-1840-1,219.2536

- It did . FROST-1840-1,219.2537

Never closed at all ? FROST-1840-1,219.2538

- Never closed at all after I got back . FROST-1840-1,219.2539

Just tell me what was the first thing you saw of the riot which
afterwards ensued ? FROST-1840-1,219.2540

- I saw the persons coming down the hill ; FROST-1840-1,219.2541

the first thing I heard previous to my seeing was the hurrahing .
FROST-1840-1,219.2542

Did that induce you to look out ? FROST-1840-1,219.2543

- No . FROST-1840-1,219.2544

Then how and when was it that you saw the persons coming down the hill ?
FROST-1840-1,219.2545

- I was standing at the door , FROST-1840-1,219.2546

and as they came <P_220> down the hill , when we heard the hurrahing ,
the constables who were in the passage were pushing over my shoulder to
look towards the window to see them , FROST-1840-1,220.2547

and I kept pushing back , being an outside one , FROST-1840-1,220.2548

and as soon as ever they came round the corner I saw them .
FROST-1840-1,220.2549

Then did they immediately form , FROST-1840-1,220.2550

or were they in ranks in the way you have described ?
FROST-1840-1,220.2551

- They were in ranks at the time they came down the hill .
FROST-1840-1,220.2552

At the time they came down the hill ? FROST-1840-1,220.2553

- Or round the corner , FROST-1840-1,220.2554

I can@ @not say down the hill . FROST-1840-1,220.2555

You have spoken of some person or other of the name of Walters ,
FROST-1840-1,220.2556

and you have spoken of some one carrying a gun , FROST-1840-1,220.2557

do you mean the same person ? FROST-1840-1,220.2558

- Walters carried a gun , FROST-1840-1,220.2559

and another man carried a gun who came up to the door ;
FROST-1840-1,220.2560

I have spoken of two carrying a gun , I believe . FROST-1840-1,220.2561

Was there any one in particular who appeared to you to be the leader ?
FROST-1840-1,220.2562

- I did not see any person in particular who appeared to be the leader .
FROST-1840-1,220.2563

Now just look at that - FROST-1840-1,220.2564

<bracket> <font> A paper being shown to the witness <$$font> <$$bracket>

by reading the whole of this deposition , unless my learned friend
wishes it . FROST-1840-1,220.2571

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> I wish to have the whole read .
FROST-1840-1,220.2572

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> I see there is one person mentioned under
the title of " leader , " FROST-1840-1,220.2573

whom do you mean ? FROST-1840-1,220.2574

- The first thing that catches my eye is , " when the leader said , '
Surrender yourselves as our prisoners ; ' " FROST-1840-1,220.2575

that is the leader who came up to the door ; FROST-1840-1,220.2576

I do not speak of the leader of the crowd . FROST-1840-1,220.2577

There is the expression " leader " frequently used there ;
FROST-1840-1,220.2578

is it the person whom you have named as Walters , or the other person
who had a gun ? FROST-1840-1,220.2579

- The other person ; FROST-1840-1,220.2580

I meant when I said leader , the person who came up to the door ;
FROST-1840-1,220.2581

it says , " when the leader said , ' Surrender yourselves as our
prisoners ' " - FROST-1840-1,220.2582

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> You had better confine yourself to
answering the question . FROST-1840-1,220.2583

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Now , I will just repeat my question .
FROST-1840-1,221.2588

You observe , you call somebody or other " the leader , " and the "
first of the mob , " and so on . FROST-1840-1,221.2589

I want to know who was that person ? FROST-1840-1,221.2590

- I believe it to be one that is dead . FROST-1840-1,221.2591

" The leader ; " FROST-1840-1,221.2592

there is the leader of those that came up to the door .
FROST-1840-1,221.2593

You need not go into further explanations . FROST-1840-1,221.2594

If you can answer the question , do ; FROST-1840-1,221.2595

if not , do not give me something that I do not ask for .
FROST-1840-1,221.2596

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> He believes him to be one
of the persons that was killed . FROST-1840-1,221.2598

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> How long after was it that the mob had
assembled before the door , that the question was asked about prisoners
which you have stated ? FROST-1840-1,221.2599

- I do not know that a minute elapsed . FROST-1840-1,221.2600

Was it not one of the first things said or done ? FROST-1840-1,221.2601

- It was ; FROST-1840-1,221.2602

that was after they had been hurrahing . FROST-1840-1,221.2603

When they came to the front of the house where there was an <P_222> open
door , was not that one of the first things said or done by any of that
body of men ? FROST-1840-1,222.2604

- It was . FROST-1840-1,222.2605

Was there a good deal of noise and confusion at that time ?

You yourself , I understood you to say , were quite in the front ?

and seeing the persons before you ? FROST-1840-1,222.2611

- I was alarmed ; FROST-1840-1,222.2612

I presume you will not undertake to swear positively to the precise
words used by the person who said what you have mentioned concerning the
prisoners ? FROST-1840-1,222.2614

- Those , I believe , to have been the words . FROST-1840-1,222.2615

I have no doubt you do , FROST-1840-1,222.2616

or you would not have sworn it . FROST-1840-1,222.2617

I only ask you whether , considering the noise that prevailed at the
time , and your situation , and the alarm , be it small or great , that
you felt , you can undertake to swear positively to the words ,
FROST-1840-1,222.2618

or do you only believe that that was the substance and effect ?
FROST-1840-1,222.2619

- There may be , perhaps , a single word ; FROST-1840-1,222.2620

but I am sure I can@ @not say . FROST-1840-1,222.2621

I believe them to have been the words that were said .

to him . FROST-1840-1,222.2627

FROST-1840-1,222.2628

Do you know who it was that cried out " never ? " FROST-1840-1,222.2630

great complaints were made by the chartists <P_223> concerning the way
in which Vincent and the others were supposed to be treated in prison ?

- No , I did not . FROST-1840-1,225.2771

What was the next thing you saw done by either side ?
FROST-1840-1,225.2772

- I heard several guns firing , FROST-1840-1,225.2773

and I saw the windows opened , FROST-1840-1,225.2774

and I went into my house FROST-1840-1,225.2775

and shut the door . FROST-1840-1,225.2776

You saw the windows of that room opened , FROST-1840-1,225.2777

and then you went into your house FROST-1840-1,225.2778

and shut your door ? FROST-1840-1,225.2779

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,225.2780

Your house , I believe , is on the east side of Westgate-street ?
FROST-1840-1,225.2786

- It is . FROST-1840-1,225.2787

Is it nearly opposite the gates that you speak of , where somebody went
up ? FROST-1840-1,225.2788

- Nearly opposite . FROST-1840-1,225.2789

How many persons went up to those gates ? FROST-1840-1,225.2790

Where were the soldiers ? FROST-1840-1,225.2794

- In the long-room . FROST-1840-1,225.2795

Which do you call the long-room ? FROST-1840-1,225.2796

- The nearest room to my house ; FROST-1840-1,225.2797

there are three windows in it . FROST-1840-1,225.2798

I think your attention had never been called to these occurrences till
you heard the noise of persons coming round the corner ?
FROST-1840-1,225.2799

- Yes ; it was , because I shut my shop about half-@ @past seven o'clock
. FROST-1840-1,225.2800

You were asked what time you observed any thing ; FROST-1840-1,225.2801

you said about nine o'clock ; FROST-1840-1,225.2802

you shut your shop between seven and eight ? FROST-1840-1,225.2803

- Between seven and eight . FROST-1840-1,225.2804

And about nine o'clock you heard this noise of people coming round the
corner ? FROST-1840-1,225.2805

- Yes , I did . FROST-1840-1,225.2806

You say your shutters were shut ? FROST-1840-1,225.2807

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,225.2808

How were the shutters of the inn at the time that the people turned
round the corner ? FROST-1840-1,225.2809

- The shutters are divided in half , FROST-1840-1,225.2810

and the lower part of them , which is about six feet from the <P_226>
ground , were shut , FROST-1840-1,226.2811

and the top shutters were open of the longroom . FROST-1840-1,226.2812

Do you know the room ? FROST-1840-1,226.2813

- Yes , perfectly well . FROST-1840-1,226.2814

When the shutters are shut , are they not six feet from the ground ?
FROST-1840-1,226.2815

- Yes , they are . FROST-1840-1,226.2816

So that persons standing on the floor of the room could not look over
them ? FROST-1840-1,226.2817

- No , they can@ @not . FROST-1840-1,226.2818

Does the ground slope away from the inn ? FROST-1840-1,226.2819

Were you at home on the morning of the 4th of November ?
FROST-1840-1,226.2839

- I was . FROST-1840-1,226.2840

Do you remember standing at your door about nine o'clock in the morning
? FROST-1840-1,226.2841

- I do . FROST-1840-1,226.2842

Was your shop open or shut at that time ? FROST-1840-1,226.2843

- It was shut ; FROST-1840-1,226.2844

I had drawn the shutters down . FROST-1840-1,226.2845

Were you standing on the outside of your door or in your door-way ?
FROST-1840-1,226.2846

- I stood with the knob of the door in my hand shut , and I on the
outside . FROST-1840-1,226.2847

About the time you have mentioned , about nine o'clock in the morning ,
did you see any body of persons coming round the corner from Stowe-hill
? FROST-1840-1,226.2848

- I did . FROST-1840-1,226.2849

What number of persons appeared to you to come round the corner at that
time ? FROST-1840-1,226.2850

they came , I suppose , within ten yards of where I stood ;
FROST-1840-1,226.2852

they came round FROST-1840-1,226.2853

and stopped opposite the large doors that go into the Westgate yard ;
FROST-1840-1,226.2854

they halted , FROST-1840-1,226.2855

and when they saw those doors shut , they wheeled round towards the
Westgate door in front . FROST-1840-1,226.2856

Do you mean the front centre door of the house ? FROST-1840-1,226.2857

- The front , the entrance into the house . FROST-1840-1,226.2858

You say , they went first to the great gates , and then they returned
from thence . FROST-1840-1,226.2859

What did they do then ? FROST-1840-1,226.2860

- When they saw those doors shut , they wheeled round ,
FROST-1840-1,226.2861

and turned towards the Westgate steps . FROST-1840-1,226.2862

They turned towards the centre of the house ? FROST-1840-1,226.2863

- They did . FROST-1840-1,226.2864

<P_227>

Is that the porch ? FROST-1840-1,227.2866

- That is the porch . FROST-1840-1,227.2867

There would then be a part of them between the Westgate and your house ?
FROST-1840-1,227.2868

- There were a great number , hundreds ; FROST-1840-1,227.2869

I should say that there may have been from 400 to 500 at the time ;
FROST-1840-1,227.2870

for I could see them still at the other side , like as if they were
still coming . FROST-1840-1,227.2871

Were they still coming in the direction of Stowe-hill ?
FROST-1840-1,227.2872

Yes , I saw none coming up Commercial-street . FROST-1840-1,227.2873

All that you saw came from Stowe-hill , FROST-1840-1,227.2874

and they appeared coming on to fill the space in front ?
FROST-1840-1,227.2875

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,227.2876

Had they any arms ? FROST-1840-1,227.2877

- They had . FROST-1840-1,227.2878

Of what description ? FROST-1840-1,227.2879

- The first man held a sword in his hand , FROST-1840-1,227.2880

and then there were various persons with guns and spikes and pikes .
FROST-1840-1,227.2881

When I say " pikes , " I mean a long stick , with an iron fixed in the
end of it . FROST-1840-1,227.2882

Spiked with iron ? FROST-1840-1,227.2883

- Yes ; FROST-1840-1,227.2884

and others with some pitch-forks , that is , hay-forks with two prongs .
FROST-1840-1,227.2885

As they stood there , did you hear any exclamation from any one of the
party ? FROST-1840-1,227.2886

- I did . FROST-1840-1,227.2887

Was that after they were formed ? FROST-1840-1,227.2888

- After they had wheeled round , and were going up the steps , I heard
the word given by one person . FROST-1840-1,227.2889

What was it he said ? FROST-1840-1,227.2890

- I do not know what he said ; FROST-1840-1,227.2891

I think it was , " In , my men ; " or , " In , my boys , "
FROST-1840-1,227.2892

and at that time I lost sight of them . FROST-1840-1,227.2893

Did you distinctly hear those words ? FROST-1840-1,227.2894

- Quite distinctly . FROST-1840-1,227.2895

Had there been any firing before you heard those words from one of the
party ? FROST-1840-1,227.2896

- Not that I am aware of . FROST-1840-1,227.2897

You say at the time those words were uttered , the party were in fact
going up the steps ? FROST-1840-1,227.2898

- The party were going up the steps , FROST-1840-1,227.2899

and I could see guns and pikes going up the steps .
FROST-1840-1,227.2900

Did you see any firing at that time ? FROST-1840-1,227.2901

- I could hear firing at the time in the passage ; FROST-1840-1,227.2902

at the time they were beating the windows . FROST-1840-1,227.2903

At the time that part of the party were breaking the windows , you heard
firing in the passage ? FROST-1840-1,227.2904

- In the passage . FROST-1840-1,227.2905

Do you know the room where the soldiers were ? FROST-1840-1,227.2906

- Perfectly well . FROST-1840-1,227.2907

Did you observe any person in the Westgate open the shutters ?
FROST-1840-1,227.2908

- I stood at my own door , FROST-1840-1,227.2909

and the moment that I saw and heard the firing commence in the room
before the shutters were opened , I went in FROST-1840-1,227.2910

and locked the door . FROST-1840-1,227.2911

You say , " in the room , " FROST-1840-1,227.2912

do you mean in the passage ? FROST-1840-1,227.2913

- The firing commenced from the mob on the front door ;
FROST-1840-1,227.2914

I was standing at my own door . FROST-1840-1,227.2915

<P_228>

Was that before any one opened the window-shutters ?
FROST-1840-1,228.2917

- Yes . FROST-1840-1,228.2918

Were those lower window-shutters closed at the time when the mob came up
? FROST-1840-1,228.2919

- They were . FROST-1840-1,228.2920

Did you see any firing into the room from the party ?
FROST-1840-1,228.2921

- I did . FROST-1840-1,228.2922

Was that before the shutters were opened ? FROST-1840-1,228.2923

- After the shutters were opened ; FROST-1840-1,228.2924

they were opening the shutters at the time the firing was at the windows
. FROST-1840-1,228.2925

Upon that , did you remain there , FROST-1840-1,228.2926

or did you go into your house ? FROST-1840-1,228.2927

- Before the soldiers began to fire , I was not aware that they were in
that room ; FROST-1840-1,228.2928

the moment I found that they were in there , I saw it was full time for
me to go ; FROST-1840-1,228.2929

I went in FROST-1840-1,228.2930

and locked the door , FROST-1840-1,228.2931

and ran up stairs to the window at the top of my own house ,
FROST-1840-1,228.2932

and there I could see them quite plain . FROST-1840-1,228.2933

Then there was no firing at all from the Westgate before the
window-shutters were opened ? FROST-1840-1,228.2934

- There may have been firing in the passage . FROST-1840-1,228.2935

Had there been any firing from the Westgate into the street before the
window-shutters were open ? FROST-1840-1,228.2936

- The soldiers , I believe , fired before the shutters were opened ,
FROST-1840-1,228.2937

but I think they fired up ; FROST-1840-1,228.2938

they could not fire upon the mob ; FROST-1840-1,228.2939

they could not see them . FROST-1840-1,228.2940

They could not possibly fire upon the mob till the shutters were open ?
FROST-1840-1,228.2941

- They could not . FROST-1840-1,228.2942

Did the upper window , that you went to , command a view of the front of
the Westgate ? FROST-1840-1,228.2943

- Entirely . FROST-1840-1,228.2944

What did you observe from thence ? FROST-1840-1,228.2945

- I was there about half a minute before the first man was shot ;
FROST-1840-1,228.2946

I saw him falling after the soldiers' window was opened ;
FROST-1840-1,228.2947

he fell nearly by the corner ; FROST-1840-1,228.2948

the next fell upon the steps ; FROST-1840-1,228.2949

he was in the act of going in when he was shot ; FROST-1840-1,228.2950

one arm was in the door when he fell , FROST-1840-1,228.2951

and the other man was shot from the nearest window to the porch ;
FROST-1840-1,228.2952

he was nearly an hour and a quarter before he died .
FROST-1840-1,228.2953

The next man jumped out of the window next the corner ;
FROST-1840-1,228.2954

he went upon his hands and knees . FROST-1840-1,228.2955

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> It is not necessary to go into these
details . FROST-1840-1,228.2956

Mr. Serjeant <font> Talfourd . <$$font> Not at all .
FROST-1840-1,228.2957

Did you see what effect the firing of the soldiers had upon the crowd
without ? FROST-1840-1,228.2958

- I did . FROST-1840-1,228.2959

What was it ? FROST-1840-1,228.2960

- The moment they saw the first man falling they all began to disperse ;
FROST-1840-1,228.2961

they were running in all directions . FROST-1840-1,228.2962

When you got up to the window at the top of the house , I suppose the
windows of the Westgate were open ? FROST-1840-1,228.2963

- They were open . FROST-1840-1,228.2964

<heading>

<font> Cross-examined by Mr. Kelly . <$$font> FROST-1840-1,228.2966

<$$heading>

I think you said you saw them come up when the mob first assembled
before the door ? FROST-1840-1,228.2968

- I saw them first coming round from the direction of Stowe-hill .
FROST-1840-1,228.2969

You say the first man held a sword in his hand ; FROST-1840-1,228.2970

who was the first man ? FROST-1840-1,228.2971

- I believe that the first man that came in was Rees the Fifer , as they
call him . FROST-1840-1,228.2972

<P_229>

Whom was it that you next saw that had a gun ? FROST-1840-1,229.2974

- John Lovett . FROST-1840-1,229.2975

Where did he come from ? FROST-1840-1,229.2976

- He came along with the mob . FROST-1840-1,229.2977

Was he outside , or in the middle , or where ? FROST-1840-1,229.2978

- He was not in the middle ; FROST-1840-1,229.2979

he walked alongside . FROST-1840-1,229.2980

How many men did you see with guns ? FROST-1840-1,229.2981

- I can@ @not say that . FROST-1840-1,229.2982

Were there several ? FROST-1840-1,229.2983

- A great number . FROST-1840-1,229.2984

Were they in front of the Westgate Inn together ? FROST-1840-1,229.2985

- I can@ @not say that they were together , because when they came to
the front of the big doors they appeared to be rather confused , because
they found no entrance in , and then they turned back again .
FROST-1840-1,229.2986

I want to know whether those persons who had guns when they first
appeared in front of the Westgate Inn were all together ,
FROST-1840-1,229.2987

or was there now and then a man with a gun , and now and then a man
without one ; FROST-1840-1,229.2988

how was it ? FROST-1840-1,229.2989

- I can@ @not answer for that ; FROST-1840-1,229.2990

I can only tell you that I saw a great number with guns .
FROST-1840-1,229.2991

In different places ? FROST-1840-1,229.2992

- They were mingled together before they came round ;
FROST-1840-1,229.2993

and when they came back again , of course I could not say .
FROST-1840-1,229.2994

Did any one more than another appear to you to be the leader ?
FROST-1840-1,229.2995

- I did not notice any thing of that , more than I heard the word
distinctly from the one man . FROST-1840-1,229.2996

Was there no one who appeared to you to be the leader ?
FROST-1840-1,229.2997

- Only this Rees the Fifer had a sword in his hand ,
FROST-1840-1,229.2998

and he seemed to wave the sword . FROST-1840-1,229.2999

Is he the one you would call the leader ? FROST-1840-1,229.3000

- I do not call him the leader more than the others , because they all
appeared to be voluntarily coming up . FROST-1840-1,229.3001

Then I am to understand you to swear , that there was no one more than
another that you would call the leader ? FROST-1840-1,229.3002

- I can@ @not name one more than another . FROST-1840-1,229.3003

Was there in fact any one more than another that you would call the
leader ; yes or no ? FROST-1840-1,229.3004

- I can@ @not answer the question in that respect , because I saw them
all voluntarily going one with another . FROST-1840-1,229.3005

Then do you think there was no leader ? FROST-1840-1,229.3006

- No , I will not say that ; FROST-1840-1,229.3007

certainly there must have been a leader in bringing them to the place .
FROST-1840-1,229.3008

I am asking you not about what must have been , but what you saw ;
FROST-1840-1,229.3009

from what you saw was there any one , or was there not , who appeared to
you to be the leader ? FROST-1840-1,229.3010

- I did not observe any one , not to swear to him ;
FROST-1840-1,229.3011

but they all appeared to me in full action in coming along .
FROST-1840-1,229.3012

Then you did not observe any one who appeared to be a leader ?
FROST-1840-1,229.3013

- - I did not observe any one alone but that one , and the man that I
heard give the command . FROST-1840-1,229.3014

When the soldiers fired out upon the mob , when the shutters were open
and they could fire freely , did not the mob disperse almost instantly
afterwards ? FROST-1840-1,229.3015

- As soon as they saw the first man shot they did , but not before .
FROST-1840-1,229.3016

<P_230>

Was not that as soon as the soldiers began to fire ?
FROST-1840-1,230.3018

- Yes , FROST-1840-1,230.3019

but the passage was full , FROST-1840-1,230.3020

and they were getting in through the windows ; FROST-1840-1,230.3021

but when they saw the first man fall , then they began to disperse .
FROST-1840-1,230.3022

I want to know whether that was when the soldiers first began to fire
out in the front ? FROST-1840-1,230.3023

- They were nearly full in front when they saw men falling ,
FROST-1840-1,230.3024

and then they began to disperse . FROST-1840-1,230.3025

I want to know whether the men did not fall the moment the soldiers
began to fire out in front ? FROST-1840-1,230.3026

- No . FROST-1840-1,230.3027

Then how long afterwards ? FROST-1840-1,230.3028

- They fired , I dare say , about a minute , or nearly thereabouts ,
because they were firing while I was going up stairs .
FROST-1840-1,230.3029

Did you see them firing out in front ? FROST-1840-1,230.3030

- I did . FROST-1840-1,230.3031
