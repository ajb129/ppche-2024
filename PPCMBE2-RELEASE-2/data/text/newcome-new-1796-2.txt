<P_12,1J>

Six days then before the passover , Jesus came to Bethany , where
Lazarus was , that had been dead , whom he had raised from the dead .
Upon which a supper was made for him there ; and Martha served : and
Lazarus was one of those that were at the table with him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.3

Then Mary took a pound of very precious ointment of liquid nard ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.4

and anointed the feet of Jesus , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.5

and wiped his feet with her hair : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.6

and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.7

Then saith one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , <bracket> <font> the
son <$$font> of Simon , <$$bracket> who was about to deliver him up ; "
Why was not this ointment sold for three_hundred denarii , and given to
the poor ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.8

Now he said this , not that he cared for the poor : but because he was a
thief , and had the purse , and carried what was put in it .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.9

Then said Jesus , " Suffer her : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.10

against the day of my embalming she hath kept this .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.11

For ye have the poor with you always : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.12

but Me ye have not always . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.13

Now a great multitude of the Jews knew that he was there :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.14

and they came , not because of Jesus only , but that they might see
Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.15

So the chief-priests consulted that they might kill Lazarus also ;
because by reason of him many of the Jews withdrew <font> from them ,
<$$font> and believed in Jesus . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.16

On the next day , a great multitude who were come to the feast , when
they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem , took branches of
palm-trees , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.17

and went forth to meet him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.18

and cried out ; " Save now ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.19

blessed <font> be <$$font> the King of Israel who cometh in the name of
the Lord . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.20

Now when Jesus had procured a young ass , he sat on it ; as it is
written ; " Fear not , daughter of Sion : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.21

behold , thy King cometh , sitting on the foal of an ass . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.22

Now these things his disciples understood not at first :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.23

but when Jesus had been glorified , then they remembered that these
things were written of him , and <font> that <$$font> they had done
these things unto him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.24

The multitude then who were with him , bare witness that he had called
Lazarus out of <font> his <$$font> sepulchre , and raised him from the
dead . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.25

For this reason also the multitude met him ; because they heard that he
had done this miracle . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.26

The Pharisees therefore said among themselves ; " Perceive ye that ye
prevail nothing ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.27

behold , the world is gone after him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.28

<P_12,20J>

Now certain Greeks were among those who came up to worship at the feast
. NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.30

So these came to Philip , that <font> was <$$font> of Bethsaida in
Galilee , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.31

and besought him , saying : " Sir , we desire to see Jesus . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.32

Philip cometh NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.33

and telleth Andrew : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.34

and again , Andrew and Philip tell Jesus . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.35

And Jesus answered them , saying ; " The hour is come that the Son of
man should be glorified . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.36

Verily verily I say unto you , Unless a grain of wheat fall into the
ground , and die , it remaineth by itself : but if it die , it bringeth
forth much produce . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.37

He that loveth his life , shall lose it ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.38

and he that hateth his life in this world , shall keep it to everlasting
life . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.39

If any man serve me , let him follow me ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.40

and , where I am , there shall my servant also be :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.41

if any man serve me , him <font> my <$$font> Father will honour .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.42

Now is my soul troubled : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.43

and what shall I say ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.44

' Father , save me from this hour . ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.45

But for this cause I came to this hour . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.46

" Father , glorify thy name . ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.47

Then a voice came from heaven , <font> saying <$$font> ; " I have both
glorified <font> it , <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.48

and will glorify <font> it <$$font> again . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.49

The multitude therefore who stood by , and heard <font> it , <$$font>
said that it thundered . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.50

Others said ; " An angel spake to him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.51

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.52

and said ; " This voice came not for my sake , but for your sakes .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.53

Now is the judgement of this world : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.54

now the prince of this world will be cast out .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.55

And although I shall be lifted up from the earth , I will draw all
<font> men <$$font> unto me . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.56

<paren> This he said , signifying what death he was about to die .
<$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.57

The multitude answered him ; " We have heard out of the law that Christ
continueth for ever : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.58

and how sayest thou , ' The Son of man must be lifted up ? '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.59

" Who is this Son of man ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.60

Then Jesus said unto them ; " <font> But <$$font> a little time <font>
longer , <$$font> the light will be among you .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.61

Walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.62

for he that walketh in darkness , knoweth not whither he goeth .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.63

While ye have the light , believe in the light , that ye may be sons of
light . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.64

These things Jesus spake , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.65

and departed , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.66

and concealed himself from them . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.67

But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed
not in him : so that the words of the prophet Isaiah were fulfilled ,
which he spake , saying ; " Lord , who hath believed our report ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.68

and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been made manifest ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.69

Therefore they could not believe , because Isaiah hath said again ;
<P_12,40J> " He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; so
that they see not with <font> their <$$font> eyes , nor understand with
<font> their <$$font> heart , and turn , that I should heal them . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.70

These things Isaiah said , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.71

Nevertheless many even among the rulers believed in him ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.72

but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <font> him , <$$font>
lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.73

for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.74

But Jesus had cried out , and said ; " He who believeth in me ,
believeth not in me , but in him who sent me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.75

And he who seeth me , seeth him who sent me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.76

I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth in me may
not remain in darkness . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.77

And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I condemn him not :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.78

<paren> for I came not to condemn the world , but to save the world :
<$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.79

he who rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath that which
condemneth him : the doctrine which I have spoken , that will condemn
him in the last day . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.80

For I have not spoken of myself ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.81

but the Father who sent me , he hath given me commandment , what I
should enjoin , and what I should speak . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.82

And I know that his commandment is everlasting life :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.83

what therefore I speak , I so speak as the Father hath enjoined me . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.84

<P_13,1J>

Now , before the feast of the passover , though Jesus knew that his hour
was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father , yet ,
having loved his own that were in the world , he loved them to the end :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.86

and supper being come , <paren> the devil having already put into the
heart of Judas Iscariot , <font> the son <$$font> of Simon , to deliver
him up ; <$$paren> though he knew , <font> I say , <$$font> that the
Father gave all things into his hands , and that he came from God , and
was going to God ; <font> yet <$$font> he riseth from supper ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.87

and layeth aside his <font> upper <$$font> garments ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.88

and took a napkin , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.89

and girt himself . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.90

Then he poureth water into a vessel , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.91

and began to wash the feet of the disciples , and to wipe <font> them
<$$font> with the napkin with which he was girded .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.92

So he cometh to Simon Peter : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.93

<bracket> and <$$bracket> <font> Peter <$$font> saith unto him ; "
Master , dost Thou wash my feet ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.94

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.95

and said unto him ; " What I do , thou knowest not now ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.96

but thou wilt know presently . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.97

Peter saith unto him ; " Thou shalt never wash my feet . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.98

Jesus answered him ; " If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
" NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.99

Simon Peter saith unto him ; " Master , not my feet only , but <font>
mine <$$font> hands and head also . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.100

Jesus saith unto him ; " He that hath bathed , needeth to wash <font>
his <$$font> feet only ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.101

and he is altogether clean : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.102

and ye are clean , but not all . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.103

For he knew who was to deliver him up : wherefore he said ; " Ye are not
all clean . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.104

So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his <font> upper
<$$font> garments , and had again placed himself at table , he said unto
them ; " Know ye what I have done to you ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.105

Ye call me , Teacher , and Master : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.106

and ye say well : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.107

for <font> so <$$font> I am . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.108

If I then , <font> your <$$font> Master and Teacher , have washed your
feet ; Ye also ought to wash one another's feet .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.109

For I have given you an example , that Ye also may do as I have done to
you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.110

<P_13,20J>

Verily verily I say unto you ; The servant is not greater than his
master ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.112

nor <font> is <$$font> the messenger greater than he who sent him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.113

Since ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.114

" I speak not of you all : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.115

I know whom I have chosen : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.116

but so the scripture is fulfilled , ' He that eateth bread with me ,
hath lifted up his heel against me . ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.117

Now I tell you before it come to pass , that , when it shall come to
pass , ye may believe that I am <font> he . <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.118

Verily verily I say unto you ; He that receiveth whom I shall send ,
receiveth me ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.119

and he that receiveth me , receiveth him that sent me . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.120

When Jesus had said thus , he was troubled in <font> his <$$font> spirit
, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.121

and testified , and said ; " Verily verily I say unto you , that one of
you will deliver me up . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.122

Then the disciples looked on one another , doubting of whom he spake .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.123

Now there was placed on the bosom of Jesus one of his disciples , whom
Jesus loved . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.124

Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him , that he should ask who it might
be of whom <font> Jesus <$$font> spake . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.125

He then who leaned on the breast of Jesus , saith unto him ; " Master ,
who is it ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.126

Jesus answereth ; " It is He to whom I shall give a sop , when I have
dipped it . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.127

And when he had dipped the sop , he giveth it to Judas Iscariot , <font>
the son <$$font> of Simon . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.128

And , after the sop , Satan entered into him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.129

Then saith Jesus unto him ; " What thou doest , do quickly . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.130

Now no man at the table knew why <font> Jesus <$$font> spake this unto
him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.131

For some thought , because Judas had the purse , that Jesus had said
unto him ; " Buy <font> those things <$$font> which we have need of for
the feast ; " or , that he should give something to the poor .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.132

He then who had received the sop , went out immediately :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.133

now it was night . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.134

When he was gone out Jesus saith ; " Now is the Son of man glorified ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.135

and God is glorified by him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.136

Since God is glorified by him , God also will glorify him in himself ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.137

and will immediately glorify him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.138

<font> My <$$font> children , <font> but <$$font> a little <font> time
<$$font> longer I shall be with you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.139

Ye will seek me : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.140

and , as I said to the Jews , ' Whither I go , ye can@ @not come , ' so
I now say to you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.141

A new commandment I give unto you , that ye love one another ; that , as
I have loved you , Ye also love one another .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.142

By this all <font> men <$$font> will know that ye are my disciples , if
ye have love to one another . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.143

Simon Peter saith unto him ; " Master , whither goest thou ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.144

Jesus answered him ; " Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.145

but thou wilt follow <bracket> me <$$bracket> hereafter . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.146

Peter saith unto him ; " Master , why can@ @not I follow thee <bracket>
now ? <$$bracket> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.147

I will lay down my life for thy sake . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.148

Jesus answered him ; " Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.149

Verily verily I say unto thee , The cock will not crow , till thou have
denied me thrice . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.150

<P_14,1J>

Let not your heart be troubled : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.152

believe in God ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.153

believe in Me also . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.154

In my Father's house are many mansions ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.155

if <font> it were <$$font> not <font> so , <$$font> I would have told
you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.156

I go to prepare a place for you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.157

And although I go and prepare a place for you , <font> yet <$$font> I
will come again , and receive you to myself ; that , where I am , Ye
also may be . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.158

And whither I go , ye know ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.159

and the way ye know . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.160

Thomas saith unto him ; " Master , we know not whither thou goest ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.161

and how can we know the way ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.162

Jesus saith unto him ; " I am the way , and the truth , and the life :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.163

no man cometh to the Father but by me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.164

If ye knew me , you would know my Father also :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.165

and henceforth ye know him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.166

and see him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.167

Philip saith unto him ; " Master , shew us the Father ; and it sufficeth
us . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.168

Jesus saith unto him ; " Have I been so long with you ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.169

and dost thou not know me , Philip ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.170

he that seeth me , seeth the Father : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.171

how then sayest thou , ' Shew us the Father ? '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.172

Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.173

the words which I speak unto you , I speak not from myself ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.174

and the Father , who abideth in me , he doeth the works .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.175

Believe me , that I <font> am <$$font> in the Father , and the Father in
me : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.176

but if not , believe <bracket> me <$$bracket> for the works themselves .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.177

Verily verily I say unto you , He who believeth in me , the works which
I do he also shall do : and greater <font> works <$$font> than these he
shall do , because I go to <bracket> my <$$bracket> Father ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.178

and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , I will do ; that the Father may
be glorified in the Son . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.179

If ye shall ask any thing in my name , I will do <font> it . <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.180

If ye love me , keep my commandments . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.181

And I will ask the Father ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.182

and he will give you another Comforter ; that he may abide with you for
ever ; <font> even <$$font> the Spirit of truth , whom the world can@
@not receive , because it discerneth him not , nor knoweth him ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.183

but ye shall know him ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.184

for he shall abide with you , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.185

and shall be in you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.186

I will not leave you destitute : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.187

I will come unto you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.188

<font> But <$$font> a little time longer , and the world shall see me no
more : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.189

but Ye shall see me : because I live , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.190

Ye also shall live . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.191

<P_14,20J>

In that day ye shall know that I <font> am <$$font> in my Father , and
you in me , and I in you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.193

He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is who loveth me
: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.194

and he who loveth me , shall be loved by my Father ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.195

and I will love him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.196

and will manifest myself to him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.197

Judas <paren> not <font> Judas <$$font> Iscariot <$$paren> saith unto
him ; " Master , how is it that thou wilt soon manifest thyself to us ,
and not to the world ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.198

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.199

and said unto him ; " If any man love me , he will keep my words :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.200

and my Father will love him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.201

and we will come to him , and make <font> our <$$font> abode with him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.202

He who loveth me not , keepeth not my words :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.203

and yet the word which ye hear , is not mine , but the Father's who sent
me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.204

These things I speak unto you , while I abide with you .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.205

But the Comforter , <font> even <$$font> the Holy Spirit which the
Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.206

and shall bring all things to your remembrance that I have said unto you
. NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.207

Peace I leave with you , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.208

my peace I give unto you ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.209

not as the world giveth , do I give unto you .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.210

Let not your heart be troubled , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.211

nor let it be dismayed . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.212

Ye have heard that I said unto you , ' I go away ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.213

and will come <font> again <$$font> unto you . '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.214

If ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because I go to the Father :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.215

for <bracket> my <$$bracket> Father is greater than I .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.216

And now I tell <font> it <$$font> you before it come to pass , that ,
when it cometh to pass , ye may believe . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.217

Hereafter I shall not talk much with you ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.218

for the prince of the world cometh , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.219

and hath nothing in me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.220

But <font> I lay down my life <$$font> that the world may know that I
love the Father ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.221

and as the Father hath commanded me , so I do .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.222

" Rise , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.223

let us go hence . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.224

<P_15,1J>

" I am the true vine ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.226

and my Father is the husbandman . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.227

Every branch in me which beareth not fruit , he taketh away :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.228

and every <font> branch <$$font> which beareth fruit , he pruneth , that
it may bear more fruit . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.229

Ye are now clean , through the words which I have spoken unto you .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.230

Abide in me ; and I <font> will abide <$$font> in you .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.231

As the branch can@ @not bear fruit of itself , unless it abide in the
vine ; so neither can ye , unless ye abide in me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.232

I am the vine ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.233

ye <font> are <$$font> the branches . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.234

He that abideth in me , and I in him , he beareth much fruit :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.235

for , severed from me , ye can do nothing .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.236

If a man abide not in me , he shall be cast out as a <font> severed
<$$font> branch , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.237

and shall wither : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.238

and men shall gather together <font> such branches , <$$font> and cast
<font> them <$$font> into the fire , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.239

and they shall be burned . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.240

If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye
will , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.241

and it shall be done for you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.242

Herein is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.243

so ye will be my disciples . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.244

As the Father hath loved me , so I have loved you :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.245

abide ye in my love . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.246

If ye keep my commandments , ye will abide in my love ; as I have kept
my Father's commandments , and abide in his love .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.247

These things I speak unto you , that my joy in you may abide , and
<font> that <$$font> your joy may be full .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.248

This is my commandment ; that ye love one another , as I have loved you
. NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.249

Greater love than this hath no man , that a man lay down his life for
his friends . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.250

Ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoever things I command you .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.251

Henceforth I call you not servants ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.252

for the servant knoweth not what his master doeth :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.253

but I call you friends ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.254

for all things which I have heard from my Father , I have made known
unto you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.255

Ye have not chosen Me ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.256

but I have chosen You , and appointed you , that ye may go and bear
fruit , and <font> that <$$font> your fruit may remain : that whatever
ye shall ask the Father in my name , he may give <font> it <$$font> you
. NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.257

" These things I command you , that ye may love one another .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.258

If the world hate you , ye know that it hated Me before <font> it hated
<$$font> You . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.259

If ye were of the world , the world would love its own :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.260

but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the
world , therefore the world hateth you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.261

<P_15,20J>

Remember the words which I said unto you ; ' The servant is not greater
than his master . ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.263

If they have persecuted Me , they will persecute You also :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.264

if they have kept My words , they will keep Your's also .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.265

But all these things they will do unto you on account of my name ;
because they know not him who sent me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.266

If I had not come , and spoken unto them , they would not have had sin :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.267

but now they have no excuse for their sin .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.268

He that hateth me , hateth my Father also .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.269

If I had not done among them the works which none other man did , they
would not have had sin : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.270

but now they have both seen , and have hated , both me and my Father .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.271

But <font> this cometh to pass , <$$font> so that the words are
fulfilled which are written in their law ; ' They hated me without a
cause . ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.272

" But when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the
Father , <font> even <$$font> the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from
the Father , he will testify of me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.273

And ye also shall testify , because ye have been with me from the
beginning . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.274

<P_16,1J>

" These things I have spoken unto you , that ye may not offend .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.276

They will put you out of the synagogues : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.277

yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he
offereth God service . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.278

And these things they will do , because they have not known the Father ,
or me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.279

But these things I have spoken unto you , that , when the time shall
come , ye may remember that I told you of them .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.280

And these things I said not unto you from the beginning , because I was
with you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.281

But now I depart to him who sent me ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.282

and none of you asketh me , ' Whither goest thou ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.283

but because I have spoken these things unto you , sorrow hath filled
your heart . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.284

" Nevertheless , I tell you the truth : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.285

It is expedient for you that I go away : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.286

for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.287

but if I go , I will send him unto you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.288

And when he is come , he will convince the world of sin , and of
righteousness , and of judgement : of sin , because they believe not in
me ; of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no
longer ; of judgement , because the prince of this world is judged .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.289

I have still many things to say unto you ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.290

but ye can@ @not bear <font> them <$$font> now .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.291

However , when he cometh , <font> even <$$font> the Spirit of truth , he
will guide you into all the truth : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.292

for he will not speak of himself ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.293

but whatsoever he shall hear , <font> that <$$font> he will speak :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.294

and he will shew you things to come . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.295

He will glorify me : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.296

for he will receive of mine , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.297

and will declare it unto you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.298

All things which the Father hath are mine : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.299

therefore I have said , that he will receive of mine , and will declare
it unto you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.300

A little time , and ye will not see me : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.301

and again a little time , and ye will see me ; because I go to the
Father . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.302

Then said <font> some <$$font> of his disciples among themselves ; "
What is this which he saith unto us ; ' A little time , and ye will not
see me : ' and again , a little time , and ye will see me : ' and , '
Because I go to the Father ? ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.303

They said therefore ; " What is this which he saith ; ' A little time ?
' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.304

we know not what he speaketh . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.305

<font> Now <$$font> Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.306

and said unto them ; " Do ye enquire among yourselves concerning this ,
that I said ; ' A little time , and ye will not see me :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.307

and again , a little time , and ye will see me ? '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.308

<P_16,20J>

" Verily verily I say unto you , that Ye will weep and lament , but the
world will rejoice : and Ye will be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be
turned into joy . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.310

A woman , when she is in travail , hath sorrow , because her hour is
come : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.311

but when she hath brought forth the child , she remembereth no more the
affliction , for joy that a man is born into the world .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.312

And thus ye have sorrow now : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.313

but I will see you again , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.314

and your heart shall rejoice , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.315

and your joy no man shall take from you . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.316

And in that day ye shall request nothing of me :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.317

Verily verily I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my
name , he will give <font> it <$$font> you .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.318

Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.319

ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.320

These things I have spoken to you in dark speeches :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.321

the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in dark speeches ,
but I shall shew you plainly of the Father .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.322

In that day , ye shall ask in my name : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.323

and I say not unto you that I will request the Father for you :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.324

for the Father himself loveth you , because ye love me , and believe
that I came forth from God . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.325

I came forth from the Father , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.326

and am come into the world : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.327

again , I leave the world , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.328

and go to the Father . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.329

His disciples say unto him ; " Lo , now thou speakest plainly ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.330

and speakest no dark speech . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.331

Now we know that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any one
should ask thee : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.332

by this we believe that thou camest forth from God . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.333

Jesus answered them ; " Do ye now believe ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.334

Behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye will be scattered
every man to his own <font> home , <$$font> and will leave me alone :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.335

and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.336

These things I have spoken unto you , that in me ye may have peace .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.337

In the world ye will have affliction : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.338

but be of good courage ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.339

I have overcome the world . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.340

<P_17,1J>

Jesus spake these words , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.342

and lifted up his eyes to heaven , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.343

and said ; " Father , the hour is come ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.344

glorify thy Son , that thy Son also may glorify thee : as thou hast
given him power over all men , that he may give everlasting life to all
whom thou hast given him . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.345

And this is everlasting life , that they may know thee the only true God
, and him whom thou hast sent , <font> even <$$font> Jesus Christ .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.346

I have glorified thee on the earth : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.347

I have finished the work which thou hast given me to do .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.348

And now , O Father , glorify thou me with thyself with the glory which I
had with thee before the world was . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.349

I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the
world : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.350

they were thine , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.351

and thou gavest them to me ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.352

and they have kept thy word . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.353

Now they know that all things , whatsoever thou hast given me , are from
thee . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.354

For I have given them the words which thou gavest me ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.355

and they have received them , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.356

and have surely known that I came forth from thee ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.357

and have believed that thou hast sent me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.358

I request for them : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.359

I request not for the world , but for those whom thou hast given me ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.360

for they are thine . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.361

And all mine are thine , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.362

and thine <font> are <$$font> mine ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.363

and I am glorified through them . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.364

And now I shall be no longer in the world ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.365

but these will be in the world , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.366

and I shall go to thee . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.367

Holy Father , keep them in that name of thine which thou hast given me ;
that they may be one , as we <font> are . <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.368

While I was with them in the world , I kept them in thy name :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.369

those whom thou gavest me , I have preserved ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.370

and none of them is destroyed , but the son of destruction ; so that the
scripture is fulfilled . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.371

But now I go to thee , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.372

and I speak these things in the world , that they may have my joy <font>
on their account <$$font> completed in them .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.373

I have given them thy words ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.374

and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , as I
am not of the world . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.375

I request not that thou wouldest take them out {TEXT:out_out} of the
world , but that thou wouldest keep them from evil .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.376

They are not of the world ; as I am not of the world .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.377

Sanctify them through thy truth : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.378

thy word is truth . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.379

As thou hast sent me into the world , I also have sent them into the
world . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.380

And for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they also may be sanctified
through the truth . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.381

<P_17,20J>

" Nor do I request for these only , but for those also who <font> shall

And the glory which thou gavest me , I have given them ; that they may
be one , as we are one ; I in them , and thou in me ; that they may be

and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,20J.384

Father , I desire that those also , whom thou hast given me , may be

NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,20J.391

When Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples
over the brook Kidron , where was a garden , into which he and his
disciples entered . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.393

And Judas also , who delivered him up , knew the place :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.394

for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.395

Judas then , having received a band <font> of soldiers , <$$font> and
officers from the chief-priests and Pharisees , cometh thither with
lanterns , and lamps , and weapons . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.396

Upon this Jesus , knowing all things which were to befal him , went
forth , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.397

and said unto them ; " Whom seek ye ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.398

They answered him ; " Jesus of Nazareth . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.399

Jesus saith unto them ; " I am <font> he . <$$font> "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.400

And Judas also , who delivered him up , stood with them .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.401

As soon then as he had said unto them , ' I am <font> he , <$$font> '
they went backward , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.402

and fell on the ground . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.403

Then he asked them again ; " Whom seek ye ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.404

And they said ; " Jesus of Nazareth . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.405

Jesus answered ; " I have told you that I am <font> he : <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.406

if therefore ye seek me , let these depart . " <paren> That the words
might be fulfilled , which he spake ; " Of those whom thou gavest me , I
have lost none . " <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.407

Then Simon Peter , having a sword , drew it ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.408

and struck a servant of the high-priest , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.409

and cut off his right ear . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.410

Now the servant's name was Malchus . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.411

Then said Jesus to Peter ; " Put up the sword into the sheath :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.412

the cup which my Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.413

Then the band , and the commander , and the officers of the Jews , took
Jesus , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.414

and bound him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.415

and led him away to Annas first ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.416

for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas , who was high-priest that year .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.417

Now Caiaphas was he who had given counsel to the Jews , that it was
expedient that one man should die for the people .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.418

And Simon Peter followed Jesus , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.419

and <font> so did <$$font> another disciple :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.420

and that disciple was known to the high-priest ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.421

and entered with Jesus into the palace of the high-priest .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.422

But Peter stood at the door without . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.423

Then that other disciple , who was known to the high-priest , went out ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.424

and spake to her who kept the door , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.425

and brought in Peter . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.426

Then the maid-servant who kept the door saith to Peter ; " Art not Thou
also <font> one <$$font> of this man's disciples ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.427

He saith ; " I am not . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.428

And the servants and officers stood NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.429

and warmed themselves , having made a fire of coals ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.430

for it was cold . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.431

And Peter stood with them , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.432

and warmed himself . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.433

Now the high-priest asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.434

<P_18,20J>

Jesus answered him ; " I have spoken openly to the world ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.436

I have always taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither all
the Jews resort ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.437

and in secret I have spoken nothing . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.438

Why askest thou Me ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.439

ask those that heard me , what I have spoken to them :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.440

behold , they know what I have said . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.441

And when he had said these words , one of the officers who stood by
struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.442

and said ; " Answerest thou the high-priest thus ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.443

Jesus answered him ; " If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil
: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.444

but if well , why dost thou smite me ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.445

<paren> <font> Now <$$font> Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the
high-priest . <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.446

And Simon Peter stood NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.447

and warmed himself . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.448

Then they said to him ; " Art not Thou also one of his disciples ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.449

He denied <font> it , <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.450

and said ; " I am not . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.451

One of the servants of the high-priest , being the kinsman of him whose
ear Peter cut off , saith ; " Did not I see thee in the garden with him
? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.452

Peter then denied it again ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.453

and immediately the cock crew . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.454

<bracket> Then <$$bracket> <font> the Jews <$$font> bring Jesus from
Caiaphas , to the judgement-hall ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.455

and it was early : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.456

and they themselves went not into the judgement-hall , lest they should
be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.457

Pilate therefore went out unto them , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.458

and said ; " What accusation bring ye against this man ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.459

They answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.460

and said unto him ; " If he were not a malefactor , we would not have
delivered him up unto thee . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.461

Then Pilate said unto them ; " Take Ye him ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.462

and judge him according to your law . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.463

The Jews therefore said unto him ; " We are not allowed to put any man
to death . " <paren> So that the words of Jesus were fulfilled , which
he spake , signifying what death he was to die . <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.464

Then Pilate entered again into the judgement-hall ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.465

and called Jesus , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.466

and said unto him ; " Art thou the king of the Jews ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.467

Jesus answered <bracket> him ; <$$bracket> " Sayest thou this of thyself
; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.468

or have others told it thee of me ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.469

Pilate answered ; " Am I a Jew ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.470

Thine own nation , and the chief-priests , have delivered thee up unto
me . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.471

What hast thou done ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.472

Jesus answered ; " My kingdom is not of this world .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.473

If my kingdom had been of this world , then my servants would have
contended , that I might not be delivered up to the Jews :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.474

but indeed my kingdom is not hence . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.475

Pilate therefore said unto him ; " Art thou a king then ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.476

Jesus answered ; " Thou sayest <font> truly <$$font> that I am a king .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.477

For this cause I was born , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.478

and for this cause I came into the world , that I might bear witness to
the truth . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.479

Every one that is of the truth , hearkeneth to my voice . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.480

Pilate saith unto him ; " What is truth ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.481

And when he had said this , he went out again to the Jews ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.482

and saith unto them ; " I find no fault in him .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.483

But ye have a custom that I should release to you one at the passover :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.484

will ye therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.485

<P_18,40J>

Then all cried out <bracket> in their turn , <$$bracket> saying ; " Not
this man , but Barabbas . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,40J.487

Now Barabbas was a robber . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,40J.488

<P_19,1J>

Then Pilate upon this took Jesus , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.490

and scourged <font> him . <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.491

And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.492

and put it on his head ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.493

and they clothed him with a purple garment ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.494

and said ; " Hail , King of the Jews . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.495

And they struck him with the palms of their hands .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.496

<font> Then <$$font> Pilate went out again ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.497

and saith unto them ; " See , I bring him out to you , that ye may know
that I find no fault in him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.498

Then Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple
garment . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.499

And <font> Pilate <$$font> saith unto them ; " See , the man . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.500

When therefore the chief-priests and the officers saw him , they cried
out , saying ; " Crucify <font> him , <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.501

crucify him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.502

Pilate saith unto them ; " Take Ye him , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.503

and crucify <font> him : <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.504

for I find no fault in him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.505

The Jews answered him ; " We have a law , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.506

and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself <font> the
<$$font> son of God . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.507

When Pilate therefore heard these words , he was the more afraid ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.508

and went again into the judgement-hall , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.509

and saith to Jesus ; " Whence art thou ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.510

But Jesus gave him no answer . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.511

Pilate saith to him ; " Speakest thou not to Me ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.512

knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to
release thee ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.513

Jesus answered ; " Thou couldest have no power against me , unless it
had been given thee from above : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.514

concerning this matter , he that delivered me up unto thee hath greater
sin . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.515

Thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.516

but the Jews cried out , saying ; " If thou release this man , thou art
not Cesar's friend . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.517

Whosoever maketh himself a king , speaketh against Cesar . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.518

When Pilate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.519

and sat down on the judgement-seat , in a place which is called the
Pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.520

<paren> now it was the Preparation-day {COM:font_change_around_"day"} of
the passover , and about the third hour : <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.521

and he saith unto the Jews ; " See , your King . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.522

But they cried out ; " Destroy <font> him , <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.523

destroy <font> him , <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.524

crucify him . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.525

Pilate saith unto them ; " Shall I crucify your King ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.526

The chief-priests answered ; " We have no king but Cesar . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.527

Then upon this <font> Pilate <$$font> delivered him up unto them to be
crucified . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.528

And they took Jesus , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.529

and led him away . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.530

And he , carrying his cross , went out to a place called , <font> The
place <$$font> of skulls ; which is called in the Hebrew , Golgotha ;
where they crucified him , and two others with him , on each side one ,
and Jesus in the midst . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.531

And Pilate wrote a title also , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.532

and put it on the cross : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.533

and the writing was , Jesus of Nazareth , the King of the Jews .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.534

<P_19,20J>

And many of the Jews read this title : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.536

for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.537

and it was written in Hebrew , <font> and <$$font> Greek , <font> and
<$$font> Latin . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.538

Upon this the chief-priests of the Jews said to Pilate ; " Write not , '
The King of the Jews ; ' but that he said , ' I am King of the Jews . '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.539

Pilate answered ; " What I have written , I have written "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.540

Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his <font>
outer <$$font> garments , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.541

and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and <font> his <$$font>
vest also : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.542

now the vest was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.543

They said therefore among themselves ; " Let us not rend it , but cast
lots for it , whose it shall be . " So that the scripture was fulfilled
, which saith ; " They divided my garments among them ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.544

and for my vesture they cast lots . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.545

These things therefore the soldiers did . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.546

Now his mother stood by the cross of Jesus , and his mother's sister ,
Mary <font> the wife <$$font> of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.547

When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple
{COM:low_attachment;_cf._Greek_original} standing by whom he loved , he
saith to his mother ; " Woman , behold , thy son . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.548

Then he saith to the disciple ; " Behold , thy mother . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.549

And from that hour the disciple took her to his own <font> home .
<$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.550

After this Jesus , knowing that all things were now finished , that the
scripture might be fulfilled , saith ; " I thirst . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.551

Now a vessel was set , full of vinegar . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.552

And some filled a spunge with vinegar , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.553

and put it upon hyssop , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.554

and raised it to his mouth . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.555

When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said ; " It is
finished : " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.556

and he bowed his head , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.557

and yielded up <font> his <$$font> spirit .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.558

The Jews therefore , because it was the <font> day of <$$font>
Preparation , that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the
sabbath , <paren> for that sabbath was a great day , <$$paren> besought
Pilate that their legs might be broken , and <font> that <$$font> they
might be taken away . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.559

Then the soldiers came , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.560

and brake the legs of the first , and of the other that was crucified
with <font> Jesus : <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.561

but when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they
brake not his legs : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.562

but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.563

and immediately there came out blood and water .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.564

And he who saw <font> these things <$$font> beareth witness ; <paren>
and his witness is true , and he knoweth that he saith truly ; <$$paren>
that ye also may believe . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.565

For these things were done , so that the scripture was fulfilled ; " A
bone of it shall not be broken . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.566

And again another <font> part of <$$font> scripture saith ; " They shall
look on him whom they pierced . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.567

<bracket> Now <$$bracket> after this , Joseph of Arimathea , <paren>
being a disciple of Jesus , but a concealed one for fear of the Jews ,
<$$paren> besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.568

and Pilate gave <font> him <$$font> leave .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.569

He came therefore , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.570

and took the body of Jesus . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.571

And Nicodemus also came , <paren> he that at first had come to Jesus by
night , <$$paren> bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about <font>
the weight of <$$font> an_hundred pounds .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.572

<P_19,40J>

Then they took the body of Jesus , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,40J.574

and wound it in linen bands with the spices , as the manner of the Jews
is to embalm . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,40J.575

Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the
garden a new sepulchre , in which no man had ever been laid ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,40J.576

There they laid Jesus therefore , because of the Preparation <font> day
<$$font> of the Jews ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,40J.577

for the sepulchre was near . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,40J.578

<P_20,1J>

But <font> on <$$font> the first <font> day <$$font> of the week Mary
Magdalene cometh to the sepulchre in the morning , when it was yet dark
, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.580

and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.581

She runneth therefore , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.582

and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.583

and saith unto them ; " They have taken away the Lord out of the
sepulchre ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.584

and we know not where they have laid him . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.585

Peter therefore went out , and that other disciple ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.586

and they came to the sepulchre . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.587

Now they both ran together : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.588

but the other disciple outran Peter , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.589

and came first to the sepulchre . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.590

And when he had stooped down to look in , he seeth the linen bands lying
; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.591

but he went not in . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.592

Then cometh Simon Peter , following him ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.593

and he went into the sepulchre , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.594

and seeth the linen bands lying ; and the napkin , which had been about
<font> Jesus's <$$font> head , not lying with the linen bands , but
wrapped up apart in another place . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.595

Then went in that other disciple also , who came first to the sepulchre
; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.596

and he saw NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.597

and believed not . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.598

For as yet they knew not the scripture , that <font> Jesus <$$font> must
rise again from the dead . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.599

Then the disciples went again to their own home .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.600

But Mary stood without at the sepulchre , weeping ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.601

and , as she wept , she stooped down to look into the sepulchre ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.602

and seeth two angels in white , sitting , one at the head and the other
at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.603

And they say unto her ; " Woman , why weepest thou ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.604

She saith unto them ; " Because they have taken away my Lord ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.605

and I know not where they have laid him . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.606

When she had said thus , she turned <font> herself <$$font> back ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.607

and seeth Jesus standing ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.608

but knew not that it was Jesus . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.609

Jesus saith unto her ; " Woman , why weepest thou ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.610

whom seekest thou ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.611

She , supposing him to be the keeper of the garden , saith unto him ; "
Sir , if thou have carried him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him
, and I will take him away . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.612

Jesus saith unto her ; " Mary . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.613

She turned , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.614

and saith unto him in the Hebrew tongue ; " Rabboni . " Which
signifieth , Master . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.615

Jesus saith unto her ; " Embrace me not : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.616

for I do not yet ascend to my Father : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.617

but go to my brethren , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.618

and say unto them ; ' I <font> shall <$$font> ascend to my Father and
your Father , and <font> to <$$font> my God and your God . '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.619

Mary Magdalene cometh NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.620

and telleth the disciples that she had seen the Lord , and that he had
said these things unto her . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.621

Then in the evening of that day , being the first <font> day <$$font> of
the week , the doors having been shut , for fear of the Jews , where the
disciples were assembled , Jesus came NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.622

and stood in the midst , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.623

and saith unto them ; " Peace <font> be <$$font> unto you . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.624

<P_20,20J>

And when he had said this , he shewed them <font> his <$$font> hands and
his side . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.626

Then the disciples were glad , when they saw the Lord .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.627

Then Jesus said to them again ; " Peace <font> be <$$font> unto you :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.628

as the Father sent me , so I send you . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.629

And when he had said this , he breathed on <font> them , <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.630

and saith unto them ; " Receive ye the Holy Spirit .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.631

If ye remit the sins of any , they are remitted unto them
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.632

if ye retain <font> them , <$$font> they are retained . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.633

But Thomas , called Didymus , one of the Twelve , was not with them when
Jesus came . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.634

Then the other disciples said unto him ; " We have seen the Lord . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.635

But he said unto them ; " Unless I shall see in his hands the print of
the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and put mine
hand into his side , I shall not believe . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.636

And , within eight days , his disciples were again within , and Thomas
with them : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.637

<font> then <$$font> Jesus cometh , the doors having been shut ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.638

and stood in the midst , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.639

and said ; " Peace <font> be <$$font> unto you . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.640

Then he saith to Thomas ; " Reach hither thy finger ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.641

and behold my hands ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.642

and reach hither thine hand , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.643

and put it into my side ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.644

and be not unbelieving , but believing . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.645

Thomas answered , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.646

and said unto him ; " My Lord , and my God . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.647

Jesus saith unto him ; " Because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed
; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.648

happy <font> are <$$font> they that have not seen , and <font> yet
<$$font> have believed . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.649

Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples , which
are not written in this book : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.650

but these are written , that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ ,
the Son of God ; and that , believing , ye may have life through his
name . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.651

<P_21,1J>

After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the
lake of Tiberias : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.653

and in this manner he shewed <font> himself . <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.654

There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and
Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and <font> the sons <$$font> of Zebedee ,
and two others of his disciples . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.655

Simon Peter saith unto them ; " I am going to fish . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.656

They say unto him ; " We also <font> will <$$font> go with thee . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.657

They departed , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.658

and went into a ship immediately ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.659

and on that night they caught nothing . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.660

But when morning was now come , Jesus stood on the shore :
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.661

the disciples however knew not that it was Jesus .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.662

Then Jesus saith unto them ; " <font> My <$$font> children , have ye any
food ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.663

They answered him , " No . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.664

And he said unto them ; Cast the net on the right side of the ship , and
ye will get <font> some . <$$font> " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.665

They cast <font> it <$$font> therefore : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.666

and now they were not able to draw it , for the multitude of fishes .
Wherefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter : " It is the
Lord . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.667

Now , when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt on <font>
his <$$font> upper garment , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.668

<paren> for he was naked , <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.669

and cast himself into the lake . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.670

And the other disciples came in the vessel , <paren> for they were not
far from land , but as it were two_hundred cubits , <$$paren> dragging
the net <font> full <$$font> of fishes . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.671

As soon then as they landed , they see a fire of coals lying , and fish
laid thereon ; and bread . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.672

Jesus saith unto them ; " Bring of the fishes which ye have now caught .
" NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.673

Simon Peter went <font> into the vessel , <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.674

and drew the net to land full of great fishes ,
an_hundred_and_fifty_three : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.675

and although there were so many , yet the net was not broken .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.676

Jesus saith unto them ; " Come <font> and <$$font> dine . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.677

Now none of the disciples durst enquire of him , " Who art thou ? "
knowing that it was the Lord . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.678

Jesus <bracket> then <$$bracket> cometh , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.679

and taketh bread , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.680

and giveth to them , and fish in like manner .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.681

Jesus shewed himself to his disciples now this third time , after he had
risen from the dead . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.682

So when they had dined , Jesus saith to Simon Peter ; " Simon , <font>
son <$$font> of Jonah , lovest thou me more than these <font> love me ?
" <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.683

He saith unto <font> Jesus ; <$$font> " Yes , Lord : thou knowest that I
love thee . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.684

<font> Jesus <$$font> saith unto him ; " Feed my lambs . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.685

<font> Jesus <$$font> saith to him again a second time ; " Simon ,
<font> son <$$font> of Jonah , lovest thou me ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.686

He saith unto <font> Jesus ; <$$font> " Yes , Lord : thou knowest that I
love thee . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.687

<font> Jesus <$$font> saith unto him ; " Tend my sheep . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.688

<font> Jesus <$$font> saith unto him the third time ; Simon , <font> son
<$$font> of Jonah , lovest thou me ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.689

Peter was grieved that <font> Jesus <$$font> said unto him the third
time , " Lovest thou me ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.690

and he said unto <font> Jesus <$$font> ; " Lord , thou knowest all
things ; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.691

thou knowest that I love thee . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.692

Jesus saith unto him ; " Feed my sheep . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.693

Verily verily I say unto thee ; When thou wast young , thou didst gird
thyself and walk whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old ,
thou wilt stretch forth thine hands , and another will gird thee , and
carry <font> thee <$$font> whither thou wouldest not . "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.694

Now he spake this , signifying by what death <font> Peter <$$font> would
glorify God . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.695

And when he had spoken this , he saith to <font> Peter <$$font> ; "
Follow me . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.696

<P_21,20J>

Then Peter turned about , NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.698

and seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following ; who had leaned on
his breast also at supper , and had said ; " Lord , which is he who
delivereth thee up ? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.699

When Peter saw him , he saith to Jesus ; " Lord , and what <font> shall
<$$font> this man <font> do ? <$$font> " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.700

Jesus saith unto him ; " If I will that he remain till I come , what
<font> is that <$$font> to thee ? NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.701

Follow Thou me . " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.702

This report therefore went abroad among the brethren , that this
disciple should not die : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.703

yet Jesus said not to him ; " He shall not die ; " but , " If I will
that he remain till I come , what <font> is that <$$font> to thee ? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.704

This is the disciple who testified of these things , and wrote these
things : NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.705

and we know that his testimony is true . NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.706

And there are many other things also that Jesus did , which , if they
were written every one , I think that even the world itself could not
contain the books <font> which would be <$$font> written .
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.707
