The Guardian . GARRICK-1759-2,1.4

Act I . GARRICK-1759-2,1.5

Scene I . GARRICK-1759-2,1.6

A Hall in Mr. Heartly's House . GARRICK-1759-2,1.7

<$$heading>

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Charles Clackit , <font> his <$$font> Nephew ,
<font> and <$$font> Servant . GARRICK-1759-2,1.9

Servant . Please to walk this Way , Sir . GARRICK-1759-2,1.10

Sir Charles . Where is your Master , Friend ? GARRICK-1759-2,1.11

Servant . In his Dressing-Room , Sir . GARRICK-1759-2,1.12

Y. Clackit . Let him know then - GARRICK-1759-2,1.13

<P_2>

Sir Charles . Pri@ @thee be quiet , <font> Jack <$$font> ;
GARRICK-1759-2,2.15

when I am in Company let me direct . GARRICK-1759-2,2.16

'T@ @is proper and decent . GARRICK-1759-2,2.17

Y. Clackit . I am dumb , Sir . GARRICK-1759-2,2.18

Sir Charles . Tell Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font> , his Friend and
Neighbour , Sir <font> Charles Clackit <$$font> , would say three words
to him . GARRICK-1759-2,2.19

Servant . I shall , Sir - GARRICK-1759-2,2.20

<bracket> <font> Exit . <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,2.21

Sir Charles . Now Nephew , consider once again , before I open the
Matter to my Neighbour <font> Heartly <$$font> , what I am going to
undertake for you . GARRICK-1759-2,2.22

- Why do@ @n't you speak ? GARRICK-1759-2,2.23

Y. Clackit . Is it proper and decent , Uncle ? GARRICK-1759-2,2.24

Sir Charles . Pshaw ! do@ @n't be a Fool - GARRICK-1759-2,2.25

but answer me - GARRICK-1759-2,2.26

do@ @n't you flatter yourself . GARRICK-1759-2,2.27

- What Assurance have you that this young Lady , my Friend's Ward , has
a liking to you ? GARRICK-1759-2,2.28

The young Fellows of this Age are all Coxcombs , GARRICK-1759-2,2.29

and I am afraid , you are no Exception to the general Rule .
GARRICK-1759-2,2.30

Y. Clackit . Thank you Uncle - GARRICK-1759-2,2.31

But may I this Instant be struck old and peevish , if I would put you
upon <P_3> a false Scent to expose you for all the fine Women in
Christendom . GARRICK-1759-2,3.32

- I assure you again and again , and you may take my Word , Uncle , that
Miss <font> Harriet <$$font> has no kind of Aversion to your Nephew and
most humble Servant . GARRICK-1759-2,3.33

Sir Charles . Ay , ay , - Vanity ! - Vanity ! GARRICK-1759-2,3.34

- but I never take a young Fellow's Word about Women ;
GARRICK-1759-2,3.35

they@ @'ll lye as fast , and with as little Conscience , as the <font>
Brussels Gazette . <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,3.36

- Produce your Proofs . GARRICK-1759-2,3.37

Y. Clackit . Ca@ @n't your Eyes see 'em , Uncle , without urging me to
the Indelicacy of repeating 'em . GARRICK-1759-2,3.38

Sir Charles . Why I see nothing but a Fool's Head and a Fool's Coat ,
supported by a pair of most unpromising Legs . GARRICK-1759-2,3.39

Have you no better Proofs ? GARRICK-1759-2,3.40

Y. Clackit . Yes , I have , my good Infidel Uncle , half a_hundred .
GARRICK-1759-2,3.41

Sir Charles . Out with them then . GARRICK-1759-2,3.42

Y. Clackit . First then - Whenever I see her , she never looks at me .
GARRICK-1759-2,3.43

- That@ @'s a Sign of Love . GARRICK-1759-2,3.44

- Whenever I speak to her , she never answers me . GARRICK-1759-2,3.45

- Another Sign of Love . GARRICK-1759-2,3.46

- And whenever I speak to any Body else , she seems to be perfectly easy
. GARRICK-1759-2,3.47

- That@ @'s a certain Sign of Love . GARRICK-1759-2,3.48

<P_4>

Sir Charles . The Devil it is ! GARRICK-1759-2,4.50

Y. Clackit . When I am with her , she@ @'s always grave ;
GARRICK-1759-2,4.51

and the Moment I get up to leave her , then the poor Thing begins - "
Why will you leave me , " Mr. <font> Clackit <$$font> ;
GARRICK-1759-2,4.52

ca@ @n't you sacrifice a few Moments to my Bashfulness ?
GARRICK-1759-2,4.53

- Stay , you agreeable Runaway , GARRICK-1759-2,4.54

stay , GARRICK-1759-2,4.55

I shall soon overcome the Fears your Presence gives me . "
GARRICK-1759-2,4.56

- I cou'd say more , GARRICK-1759-2,4.57

- But a Man of Honour , Uncle - GARRICK-1759-2,4.58

Sir Charles What , and has she said all these Things to you ?
GARRICK-1759-2,4.59

Y. Clackit . O yes , and ten times more - with her Eyes .
GARRICK-1759-2,4.60

Sir Charles With her Eyes ! GARRICK-1759-2,4.61

- Eyes are very equivocal , <font> Jack <$$font> - GARRICK-1759-2,4.62

However , if the young Lady has any Liking to you , Mr. <font> Heartly
<$$font> is too much a Man of the World , and too much my Friend , to
oppose the Match ; GARRICK-1759-2,4.63

so do you walk into the Garden , GARRICK-1759-2,4.64

and I will open the Matter to him . GARRICK-1759-2,4.65

Y. Clackit Is there any Objection to my staying , Uncle ?
GARRICK-1759-2,4.66

The Business will be soon ended . GARRICK-1759-2,4.67

- You will propose the Match , GARRICK-1759-2,4.68

he will give his Consent , GARRICK-1759-2,4.69

I shall give mine , GARRICK-1759-2,4.70

Miss is sent for , GARRICK-1759-2,4.71

and <font> l'affair est fait . <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,4.72

<bracket> <font> Snapping his Finger . <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,4.73

<P_5>

Sir Charles . And so you think that a young beautiful Heiress , with
Forty_Thousand Pounds , is to be had with a Scrap of <font> French
<$$font> , and a Snap of your Finger . GARRICK-1759-2,5.75

- Pri@ @thee get away , GARRICK-1759-2,5.76

and do@ @n't provoke me . GARRICK-1759-2,5.77

Y. Clackit . Nay , but , my dear Uncle - GARRICK-1759-2,5.78

Sir Charles Nay , but my impertinent Nephew , either retire , or I@ @'ll
throw up the Game . GARRICK-1759-2,5.79

<bracket> <font> Putting him out . <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,5.80

Y. Clackit . Well , well , I am gone , Uncle . GARRICK-1759-2,5.81

- When you come to the Point , I shall be ready to make my Appearance .
GARRICK-1759-2,5.82

- <font> Bon Voyage ! <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,5.83

<bracket> <font> Exit . <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,5.84

Sir Charles . The Devil@ @'s in these young Fellows , I think -
GARRICK-1759-2,5.85

We send 'em abroad to cure their Sheepishness , GARRICK-1759-2,5.86

and they get above Proof the other way . GARRICK-1759-2,5.87

- <font> <paren> Enter Mr. <$$font> Heartly . <$$paren> -
GARRICK-1759-2,5.88

Good Morrow to you , Neighbour . GARRICK-1759-2,5.89

Heartly . And to you , Sir <font> Charles <$$font> ,
GARRICK-1759-2,5.90

I am glad to see you so strong and healthy . GARRICK-1759-2,5.91

<P_6>

Sir Charles . I can return you the Compliment , my Friend , - Without
Flattery GARRICK-1759-2,6.93

you do@ @n't look more than Thirty-five ; GARRICK-1759-2,6.94

and between ourselves , you are on the wrong Side of Forty -
GARRICK-1759-2,6.95

But Mum for that . GARRICK-1759-2,6.96

Heartly . Ease and Tranquility keep me as you see .
GARRICK-1759-2,6.97

Sir Charles . Why do@ @n't you marry Neighbour ? GARRICK-1759-2,6.98

A good Wife would do well for you . GARRICK-1759-2,6.99

Heartly . For me ? GARRICK-1759-2,6.100

you are pleased to be merry Sir <font> Charles . <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,6.101

Sir Charles . No faith , I am serious , GARRICK-1759-2,6.102

and had I a Daughter to recommend to you , you should say me nay more
than once , I assure you , Neighbour <font> Heartly <$$font> , before I
would quit you . GARRICK-1759-2,6.103

Heartly . I am much obliged to you . GARRICK-1759-2,6.104

Sir Charles . But indeed , you are a little too much of the Philosopher
, to think of being troubled with Women and their Concerns .
GARRICK-1759-2,6.105

Heartly . I beg your Pardon {COM:missing_comma} Sir <font> Charles
<$$font> - GARRICK-1759-2,6.106

Tho' there are many , who call themselves Philosophers , that live
single , and perhaps are in the right of it , yet I can@ @not think that
Marriage is at all inconsistent <P_7> with true Philosophy .
GARRICK-1759-2,7.107

- A wise Man will resolve to live like the rest of the World , with this
only Difference , that he is neither a Slave to Passions nor Events .
GARRICK-1759-2,7.108

- It is not because I have a little Philosophy , but because I am on the
wrong Side of Forty {COM:missing_comma} Sir <font> Charles <$$font> ,
that I desire to be excused <font> <paren> smiling <$$paren> . <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,7.109

Sir Charles . As you please , Sir , - GARRICK-1759-2,7.110

and now to my Business - GARRICK-1759-2,7.111

You have no Objection I suppose to tie up your Ward , Miss <font>
Harriet <$$font> , though you have slipped the Collar yourself - Ha !
ha ! ha ! GARRICK-1759-2,7.112

Heartly . Quite the contrary , Sir ; GARRICK-1759-2,7.113

I have taken her some time from the Boarding School , and brought her
home , in order to dispose of her worthily , with her own Inclination .
GARRICK-1759-2,7.114

Sir Charles . Her Father , I have heard you say , recommended that
particular Care to you , when she had reached a certain Age .
GARRICK-1759-2,7.115

Heartly . He did so - GARRICK-1759-2,7.116

and I am the more desirous to obey him scrupulously in this Circumstance
, as she will be a most valuable Acquisition to the Person who shall
gain her - GARRICK-1759-2,7.117

for , not to mention her Fortune , which is the least Consideration ,
her Sentiments are worthy her Birth ; GARRICK-1759-2,7.118

she is gentle , modest , and obliging . GARRICK-1759-2,7.119

- In a Word , my Friend , I never saw Youth more amiable or discreet ,
GARRICK-1759-2,7.120

- but perhaps I am a little partial to her . GARRICK-1759-2,7.121

<P_8>

Sir Charles . No , no , she is a delicious Creature ,
GARRICK-1759-2,8.123

every body says so . GARRICK-1759-2,8.124

- But I believe , Neighbour , something has happened that you little
think of {TEXT:off} . GARRICK-1759-2,8.125

Heartly . What , pray Sir <font> Charles ? <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,8.126

Sir Charles . My Nephew , Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font> -
GARRICK-1759-2,8.127

<font> Enter <$$font> Young Clackit , GARRICK-1759-2,8.128

Y. Clackit . Here I am at your Service , Sir , - GARRICK-1759-2,8.129

My Uncle is a little unhappy in his Manner ; GARRICK-1759-2,8.130

but I@ @'ll clear the Matter in a Moment - GARRICK-1759-2,8.131

Miss <font> Harriet <$$font> , Sir , - Your Ward . GARRICK-1759-2,8.132

- Sir Charles . Get away , you Puppy ! GARRICK-1759-2,8.133

Y. Clackit , Miss <font> Harriet <$$font> , Sir , your Ward , - a most
accomplish'd young Lady , to be sure - GARRICK-1759-2,8.134

Sir Charles . Thou art a most accomplish'd Coxcomb , to be sure .
GARRICK-1759-2,8.135

Heartly . Pray , Sir <font> Charles <$$font> , let the young Gentleman
speak . GARRICK-1759-2,8.136

<P_9>

Y. Clackit . You@ @'ll excuse me , Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font> -
GARRICK-1759-2,9.138

My Uncle does not set up for an Orator , - a little confused , or so ,
Sir , GARRICK-1759-2,9.139

- You - see me what I am , GARRICK-1759-2,9.140

- But I ought to ask Pardon for the young Lady and myself .
GARRICK-1759-2,9.141

- We are young Sir , GARRICK-1759-2,9.142

must confess we were wrong to conceal it from you , GARRICK-1759-2,9.143

- but my Uncle I see is pleased to be angry , GARRICK-1759-2,9.144

and therefore , I shall say no more at present . GARRICK-1759-2,9.145

Sir Charles . If you do@ @n't leave the Room this Moment , and stay in
the Garden , till I call you - GARRICK-1759-2,9.146

Y. Clackit . I am sorry I have displeased you - GARRICK-1759-2,9.147

I did not think it was <font> mal-a-propos <$$font> ;
GARRICK-1759-2,9.148

but you must have your way Uncle - GARRICK-1759-2,9.149

You command - GARRICK-1759-2,9.150

I submit - GARRICK-1759-2,9.151

Mr. <font> Heartly , <$$font> your's . GARRICK-1759-2,9.152

<bracket> <font> Exit Young <$$font> Clackit . GARRICK-1759-2,9.153

Sir Charles . Puppy ! <font> <paren> aside <$$paren> <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,9.154

My Nephew@ @'s a little unthinking , Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font> , as
you see , GARRICK-1759-2,9.155

and therefore I have been a little cautious how I have proceeded in this
Affair : GARRICK-1759-2,9.156

But indeed , he has perswaded me in a Manner , that your Ward and he are
not ill together . GARRICK-1759-2,9.157

Heartly . Indeed ! This is the first Notice I have had of it ,
GARRICK-1759-2,9.158

and I can@ @not conceive why Miss <font> Harriet <$$font> should conceal
it from me ; GARRICK-1759-2,9.159

for I have often assured her , <P_10> that I would never oppose her
Inclination , though I might endeavour to direct it .
GARRICK-1759-2,10.160

Sir Charles . 'T@ @is human Nature , Neighbour , -
GARRICK-1759-2,10.161

We are so ashamed of our first Passion , that we would willingly hide it
from ourselves - GARRICK-1759-2,10.162

But will you mention my Nephew to her . GARRICK-1759-2,10.163

Heartly . I must beg your Pardon , Sir <font> Charles <$$font> ,
GARRICK-1759-2,10.164

- The Name of the Gentleman whom she chuses , must first come from
herself , - GARRICK-1759-2,10.165

My Advice or Importunity shall never influence her :
GARRICK-1759-2,10.166

If Guardians would be less rigorous , young People would be more
reasonable ; GARRICK-1759-2,10.167

and I am so unfashionable to think , that Happiness in Marriage ca@ @n't
be bought too dear . GARRICK-1759-2,10.168

I am still on the wrong Side of Forty , Sir <font> Charles . <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,10.169

Sir Charles . No , no , - You are right Neighbour ,
GARRICK-1759-2,10.170

- But here she is , GARRICK-1759-2,10.171

- Do@ @n't alarm her young Heart too much , I beg of you ,
GARRICK-1759-2,10.172

- Upon my Word , she is a sweet Morsel . GARRICK-1759-2,10.173

I shall not reproach you with any thing , but keeping your Wishes a

Miss Harriet . - Upon my Word , Sir , GARRICK-1759-2,11.189

I@ @'ll lay my Life 't@ @is a Treaty of Marriage .
GARRICK-1759-2,11.192

- Is that such a dreadful Thing ? GARRICK-1759-2,11.193

Oh , for shame , Madam ! Young Ladies of Fashion are not frightened at
such Things now a days . GARRICK-1759-2,11.194

Heartly <font> to Sir <$$font> Charles . We have gone too far , Sir
<font> Charles <$$font> , GARRICK-1759-2,11.195

- We must excuse her Delicacy , and give her Time to recover ,
GARRICK-1759-2,11.196

- I had better talk with her alone ; GARRICK-1759-2,11.197

we will leave her now ; GARRICK-1759-2,11.198

- Be perswaded that no Endeavours shall be wanting on my Part , to bring
this Affair to a happy and a speedy Conclusion . GARRICK-1759-2,11.199

Sir Charles I shall be obliged to you , Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font> -

<bracket> <font> Exeunt Sir <$$font> Charles <font> and <$$font> Heartly

Lucy . Indeed , Miss <font> Harriet <$$font> , you are very particular
; GARRICK-1759-2,12.208

you was tired of the Boarding School , GARRICK-1759-2,12.209

and yet seem to have no Inclination to be married -
GARRICK-1759-2,12.210

What can be the Meaning of all this ? GARRICK-1759-2,12.211

- That smirking old Gentleman is Uncle to Mr. <font> Clackit <$$font> ;
GARRICK-1759-2,12.212

and , my Life for it , he has made some Proposals to your Guardian .
GARRICK-1759-2,12.213

Miss Harriet . Pri@ @thee do@ @n't plague me about Mr. <font> Clackit
. <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,12.214

Lucy . But why not , Miss ? GARRICK-1759-2,12.215

Tho' he is a little fantastical , loves to hear himself talk , and is
somewhat self-sufficient ; you must consider he is young , has been
abroad , and keeps good Company : GARRICK-1759-2,12.216

- The trade will soon be at an end , if young Ladies and Gentlemen grow
over nice and exceptious . GARRICK-1759-2,12.217

Miss Harriet . But if I can find one without these Faults , I may
surely please myself . GARRICK-1759-2,12.218

Lucy . Without these Faults ! GARRICK-1759-2,12.219

and is he young , Miss ? GARRICK-1759-2,12.220

Miss Harriet . He is sensible , modest , polite , affable , and
generous ; GARRICK-1759-2,12.221

and charms from the natural Impulses of his <P_13> own Heart , as much
as others disgust by their senseless Airs , and insolent Affectation .
GARRICK-1759-2,13.222

Lucy . Upon my word ! GARRICK-1759-2,13.223

- But why have you kept this Secret so long ? GARRICK-1759-2,13.224

- Your Guardian is kind to you beyond Conception .
GARRICK-1759-2,13.225

- What Difficulties can you have to overcome ? GARRICK-1759-2,13.226

Miss Harriet . Why the Difficulty of declaring my Sentiments .
GARRICK-1759-2,13.227

Lucy . Leave that to me , Miss . GARRICK-1759-2,13.228

- But your Spark , with all his Accomplishments , must have very little
Penetration not to have discovered his good Fortune in your Eyes .
GARRICK-1759-2,13.229

Miss Harriet . I take care that my Eyes do@ @n't tell too much ;
GARRICK-1759-2,13.230

and he has too much Delicacy to interpret Looks to his Advantage .
GARRICK-1759-2,13.231

Besides , he would certainly disapprove my Passion ;
GARRICK-1759-2,13.232

and if I should ever make the Declaration , and meet with a Denial , I
should absolutely die with Shame . GARRICK-1759-2,13.233

Lucy . I@ @'ll ensure your Life for a Silver Thimble .
GARRICK-1759-2,13.234

- But what can possibly hinder your coming together ?
GARRICK-1759-2,13.235

Miss Harriet . His Excess of Merit . GARRICK-1759-2,13.236

Lucy . His Excess of a Fiddlestick ; GARRICK-1759-2,13.237

- But come , GARRICK-1759-2,13.238

I@ @'ll put you in the way ; GARRICK-1759-2,13.239

- You shall trust me with the Secret ; GARRICK-1759-2,13.240

- I@ @'ll entrust it again to half_a_dozen Friends ,
GARRICK-1759-2,13.241

they <P_14> Shall entrust it to half_a_dozen more , by which Means it

Sir Charles . I@ @'ll tell you what , <font> Jack <$$font> ,
GARRICK-1759-2,26.475

- There is a certain Kind of Impudence about you , that I do@ @n't
approve of ; GARRICK-1759-2,26.476

and were I a young Girl , those Coxcomical Airs of your's would surfeit
me . GARRICK-1759-2,26.477

Y. Clackit . But as the young Ladies are not quite so squeamish , as
you Uncle , I fancy they will chuse me as I am . Ha ! ha !
GARRICK-1759-2,26.478

- But what can the Lady object to ? GARRICK-1759-2,26.479

I have offered to marry her , GARRICK-1759-2,26.480

is not that a Proof sufficient that I like her ? GARRICK-1759-2,26.481

A young Fellow <P_27> must have some Affection that will go such lengths
to indulge it . Ha ! ha ! GARRICK-1759-2,27.482

Sir Charles . Why really , Friend <font> Heartly <$$font> , I do@ @n't
see how a young Man can well do more , or a Lady desire more ,
GARRICK-1759-2,27.483

- - What say you , Neighbour ? GARRICK-1759-2,27.484

Heartly . Upon my Word , I am puzzled about it , GARRICK-1759-2,27.485

- My Thoughts upon the Matter are so various , and so confused .
GARRICK-1759-2,27.486

- Every thing I see and hear is so contradictory - GARRICK-1759-2,27.487

Is so - GARRICK-1759-2,27.488

She certainly , can@ @not like any Body else ? GARRICK-1759-2,27.489

Y. Clackit . No , no , I@ @'ll answer for that - GARRICK-1759-2,27.490

Heartly . Or she may be fearful then , that your Passion for her is not
sincere , or like other young Men of the Times , you may grow careless
upon Marriage and neglect her . GARRICK-1759-2,27.491

Y. Clackit . Ha ! Egad , you have hit it ; GARRICK-1759-2,27.492

Y. Clackit . <font> Je vous demande pardon <$$font> -
GARRICK-1759-2,27.496

I have sworn to her a_hundred and a_hundred Times , that she should be
the happiest of her Sex ; GARRICK-1759-2,27.497

- But there is nothing surprizing in all this , GARRICK-1759-2,27.498

it is the Misery of an overfond <P_28> Heart , to be always doubtful of
its Happiness . GARRICK-1759-2,28.499

Heartly <font> <paren> Speaking to a Servant . <$$paren> <$$font> Tell
Miss <font> Harriet <$$font> , that I am here . GARRICK-1759-2,32.574

<bracket> <font> Exit Servant . <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,32.576

However mysterious her Conduct appears to me , yet still it is to be
decyphered - GARRICK-1759-2,32.577

This young Gentleman has certainly touch'd her - GARRICK-1759-2,32.578

There are some Objections to him , GARRICK-1759-2,32.579

and among so many young Men of Fashion that fall in her way , she
certainly might have made a better Choice : GARRICK-1759-2,32.580

She has an Understanding to be sensible of this ; GARRICK-1759-2,32.581

and , if I am not mistaken , it is a Struggle between her Reason and her
Passion , that occasions all this Confusion . GARRICK-1759-2,32.582

- But here she is . GARRICK-1759-2,32.583

<font> Enter Miss <$$font> Harriet . GARRICK-1759-2,32.584

Miss Harriet . I hope you are not angry , Sir , that I left you so
abruptly , without making any Apology ? GARRICK-1759-2,32.585

- Heartly . I am angry that you think any Apology necessary .
GARRICK-1759-2,32.586

- The Matter we were upon was of such a delicate <P_33> Nature , that I
was more pleased with your Confusion , than I should have been with your
Excuses . GARRICK-1759-2,33.587

- You@ @'ll pardon me , my Dear . GARRICK-1759-2,33.588

- Miss Harriet . I have reflected , that the Person for whom I have
conceiv'd most tender Regard , may , from the wisest Motives , doubt of
my Passion ; GARRICK-1759-2,33.589

and therefore I would endeavour to answer all his Objections , and
convince him how deserving he is of my highest Esteem .
GARRICK-1759-2,33.590

Heartly . I have not yet apprehended what kind of Dispute could arise
between you and Mr. <font> Clackit : <$$font> - GARRICK-1759-2,33.591

I would advise you both to come to a Reconciliation as soon as possible
. GARRICK-1759-2,33.592

- The Law of Nature is an imperious one , GARRICK-1759-2,33.593

and can@ @not , like those of our Country , be easily evaded ;
GARRICK-1759-2,33.594

and though Reason may suggest some disagreeable Reflections , yet when
the Stroke is to be given , we must submit to it .
GARRICK-1759-2,33.595

Miss Harriet . Nothing , Sir . GARRICK-1759-2,33.601

- Pray go on . GARRICK-1759-2,33.602

- Heartly . I guess whence proceeds all your Uneasiness .
GARRICK-1759-2,33.603

- You fear that the World will not be so readily convinced of this young
Gentleman's Merit as you are : GARRICK-1759-2,33.604

<P_34>

And , indeed , I could wish him more deserving of you ;
GARRICK-1759-2,34.606

but your Regard for him gives him a Merit he otherwise would have wanted
, GARRICK-1759-2,34.607

and almost makes me blind to his Failings . GARRICK-1759-2,34.608

Miss Harriet . And would you advise me , Sir , to make choice of this
Gentleman ? GARRICK-1759-2,34.609

Heartly . I would advise you , as I always have done , to consult your
own Heart upon such an Occasion . GARRICK-1759-2,34.610

Miss Harriet . If that is your Advice , I will most religiously follow
it ; GARRICK-1759-2,34.611

and , for the last time , I am resolved to discover my real Sentiments ;
GARRICK-1759-2,34.612

but as a Confession of this kind will not become me , I have been
thinking of some innocent Stratagem to spare my Blushes , and in part to
relieve me from the Shame of a Declaration . GARRICK-1759-2,34.613

- Might I be permitted to write to him ? GARRICK-1759-2,34.614

- Heartly . I think you may , my Dear , without the least Offence to
your Delicacy : GARRICK-1759-2,34.615

And indeed you ought to explain yourself ; GARRICK-1759-2,34.616

your late Misunderstanding makes it absolutely necessary .
GARRICK-1759-2,34.617

Miss Harriet . Will you be kind enough to assist me ;
GARRICK-1759-2,34.618

GARRICK-1759-2,39.713

- Sir <font> Charles <$$font> is without , Sir , GARRICK-1759-2,39.714

and is impatient to know your Determination ; GARRICK-1759-2,39.715

- May he be permitted to see you ? GARRICK-1759-2,39.716

Lucy . Upon my Word this is very whimsical . GARRICK-1759-2,39.719

- What is the Reason , Miss , that your Guardian is gone away without
giving me an Answer ? GARRICK-1759-2,39.720

<P_40>

Miss Harriet . <font> <paren> Aside . <$$paren> <$$font> What a

Lucy . Extremely well , this , and equally Foolish on both Sides !
GARRICK-1759-2,40.724

But what can be the Meaning of it ? GARRICK-1759-2,40.725

- Ho , ho , - I think I have a Glimmering at last .
GARRICK-1759-2,40.726

- Suppose she shou'd not like young Shatter-brains after all ;
GARRICK-1759-2,40.727

and indeed she has never absolutely said she did ; GARRICK-1759-2,40.728

who knows but she has at last opened her Mind to my good Master ,
GARRICK-1759-2,40.729

and he , finding her Taste <paren> like that of other Girls at her Age
<$$paren> most particularly ridiculous , has not been so Complaisant as
he used to be . GARRICK-1759-2,40.730

- What a Shame it is that I do@ @n't know more of this Matter , a Wench
of Spirit , as I am , a Favourite of my Mistress , and as inquisitive as
I ought to be ? GARRICK-1759-2,40.731

It is an Affront to my Character , GARRICK-1759-2,40.732

and I must have Satisfaction immediately . GARRICK-1759-2,40.733

- <font> <paren> Going . <$$paren> <$$font> I will go directly to my
young Mistress , teize her to death , till I am at the Bottom of this ;
GARRICK-1759-2,40.734

and if Threatning , Soothing , Scolding , Whispering , Crying , and
Lying will not prevail , I will e'en give her Warning , - And go upon
the Stage . GARRICK-1759-2,40.735

Heartly . The more I reflect upon what has pass'd , the more I am
convinc'd that she did not intend writing to this young Fellow .
GARRICK-1759-2,40.738

- What am I to {TEXT:missing_"to"} think of it then ?
GARRICK-1759-2,40.739

- Let a Man be ever so much upon his Guard against the Approaches of
Vanity , yet he will find himself weak in that Quarter .
GARRICK-1759-2,40.740

- Had not my Reason made a little Stand against my Presumption , I might
have interpreted some of <font> Harriet's <$$font> Words in my own
Favour ; GARRICK-1759-2,40.741

but - <P_41> I may well blush , tho' alone , at my extravagant Folly !
GARRICK-1759-2,41.742

- Can it be possible that so young a Creature shou'd even cast a Thought
of that kind upon me ? - Upon me ! GARRICK-1759-2,41.743

Presumptuous Vanity ! GARRICK-1759-2,41.744

- No , no , - I will do her and myself the Justice to acknowledge that ,
for a very few slight Appearances , there are a_thousand Reasons that
destroy so ridiculous a Supposition . GARRICK-1759-2,41.745

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Charles . GARRICK-1759-2,41.746

Sir Charles . Well , Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font> , what are we to hope
for ? GARRICK-1759-2,41.747

Heartly . Upon my Word , Sir , I am still in the Dark ;
GARRICK-1759-2,41.748

we puzzle about , indeed , GARRICK-1759-2,41.749

but we do@ @n't get forward . GARRICK-1759-2,41.750

Sir Charles . What the Devil is the Meaning of all this ?
GARRICK-1759-2,41.751

There never sure were Lovers so difficult to bring together .
GARRICK-1759-2,41.752

But have you not been a little too rough with the Lady ?
GARRICK-1759-2,41.753

For as I pass'd by her but now , she seem'd a little out of Humour , -
And , upon my Faith , not the less beautiful for a little pouting .
GARRICK-1759-2,41.754

Heartly . Upon my Word , Sir <font> Charles <$$font> , what I can
collect from her Behaviour is , that your Nephew is not so much in her
good Graces , as he made you believe . GARRICK-1759-2,41.755

Sir Charles . ' Egad , like enough ; GARRICK-1759-2,41.756

- But hold , hold , GARRICK-1759-2,41.757

- this must be look'd a little into ; GARRICK-1759-2,41.758

- if it is so , I wou'd be glad to know , why , and wherefore , I have
been made so ridiculous . GARRICK-1759-2,41.759

- Eh , Master <P_42> <font> Heartly <$$font> , does he take me for his
Fool , his Beast , his Merry Andrew ? GARRICK-1759-2,42.760

By the Lord <font> Harry <$$font> - GARRICK-1759-2,42.761

Heartly . In him a little Vanity is excusable . GARRICK-1759-2,42.762

Sir Charles . I am his Vanity's humble Servant for that tho' .
GARRICK-1759-2,42.763

- Heartly . He is of an Age , Sir <font> Charles <$$font> -
GARRICK-1759-2,42.764

Sir Charles . Ay , of an Age to be very impertinent ;
GARRICK-1759-2,42.765

but I shall desire him to be less free with his Uncle for the future , I
assure him . GARRICK-1759-2,42.766

<font> Enter <$$font> Lucy . GARRICK-1759-2,42.767

Lucy . I have it , I have it , Gentlemen ! GARRICK-1759-2,42.768

You need not puzzle any more about the Matter . GARRICK-1759-2,42.769

- I have got the Secret . GARRICK-1759-2,42.770

- I know the Knight-Errant that has wounded our distress'd Lady .
GARRICK-1759-2,42.771

Sir Charles . Well , and who ? And what , Child ?
GARRICK-1759-2,42.772

Lucy . What , has not she told you , Sir ? <font> <paren> To <$$font>
Heartly . <$$paren> GARRICK-1759-2,42.773

Heartly . Not directly . GARRICK-1759-2,42.774

Lucy . So much the better . GARRICK-1759-2,42.775

- What Pleasure it is to discover a Secret , and then tell it to all the
World ! GARRICK-1759-2,42.776

I press'd her so much , that she at last confess'd .
GARRICK-1759-2,42.777

<P_43>

Sir Charles . Well , what ? GARRICK-1759-2,43.779

Lucy . That , in the first place , she did not like your Nephew .
GARRICK-1759-2,43.780

Sir Charles . And I told the Puppy so . GARRICK-1759-2,43.781

Lucy . That she had a most mortal Antipathy for the young Men of this
Age ; and that she had settled her Affections upon one of riper Years ,
and riper Understanding . GARRICK-1759-2,43.782

Sir Charles . Indeed ? GARRICK-1759-2,43.783

Lucy . And that she expected from a Lover in his Autumn more Affection
, more Complaisance , more Constancy , and more Discretion of Course .
GARRICK-1759-2,43.784

Heartly . That is very particular . GARRICK-1759-2,43.785

Sir Charles . Ay , but it is very prudent for all that .
GARRICK-1759-2,43.786

Lucy . In short , as she had openly declared against the Nephew , I
took upon me to speak of his Uncle . GARRICK-1759-2,43.787

Sir Charles . Of me , Child ? GARRICK-1759-2,43.788

<P_44>

Lucy . Yes , of you , Sir ; GARRICK-1759-2,44.790

- And she did not say me Nay , GARRICK-1759-2,44.791

- But cast such a Look , and fetch'd such a Sigh , - That if ever I
look'd and sigh'd in my Life , I know how it is with her .
GARRICK-1759-2,44.792

Sir Charles . What the Devil ! GARRICK-1759-2,44.793

- Why surely , - Eh , <font> Lucy ! <$$font> You joke for certain ,
GARRICK-1759-2,44.794

- Mr. <font> Heartly ! <$$font> - Eh ! GARRICK-1759-2,44.795

- Lucy Indeed I do not , Sir , GARRICK-1759-2,44.796

- 'T@ @was in vain for me to say that nothing cou'd be so ridiculous as
such a Choice . GARRICK-1759-2,44.797

- Nay , Sir , I went a little further , <paren> You@ @'ll excuse me
<$$paren> GARRICK-1759-2,44.798

and told her - Good God Madam , said I , why he is Old and Gouty ,
Astmatic , Rheumatic , Sciatic , Spleen-atic . GARRICK-1759-2,44.799

- It signified nothing , GARRICK-1759-2,44.800

she had determined . GARRICK-1759-2,44.801

- Sir Charles . But you need not have told her all that .
GARRICK-1759-2,44.802

Heartly . I am persuaded , Sir <font> Charles <$$font> , that a good
Heart , and a good Mind will prevail more with that young Lady , than
the more fashionable Accomplishments . GARRICK-1759-2,44.803

Sir Charles . I@ @'ll tell you what , Neighbour , GARRICK-1759-2,44.804

I have had my Days , GARRICK-1759-2,44.805

and have been well receiv'd among the Ladies , I have -
GARRICK-1759-2,44.806

But in Truth , I am rather in my Winter than my Autumn ;
GARRICK-1759-2,44.807

she must mean somebody else . GARRICK-1759-2,44.808

Now I think again - GARRICK-1759-2,44.809

It ca@ @n't be me - GARRICK-1759-2,44.810

No , no , it ca@ @n't be me . GARRICK-1759-2,44.811

Lucy . But I tell you it is , Sir . GARRICK-1759-2,44.812

- You are the Man , - GARRICK-1759-2,44.813

<P_45>

Her Stars have decreed it ; GARRICK-1759-2,45.815

and what they decree , tho' ever so ridiculous , must come to pass .
GARRICK-1759-2,45.816

- Sir Charles . Say you so ? GARRICK-1759-2,45.817

- Why then , Monsieur Nephew , I shall have a little Laugh with you , -
Ha , ha , ha ! GARRICK-1759-2,45.818

The Tit-bit is not for you , my nice Sir . GARRICK-1759-2,45.819

Miss Harriet . It is a most terrible Task ; GARRICK-1759-2,49.890

but I am compel'd to it , GARRICK-1759-2,49.891

and to hesitate any longer wou'd be injurious to my Guardian , his

GARRICK-1759-2,49.892

Y. Clackit . Most judicious , upon my Soul . GARRICK-1759-2,49.893

Sir Charles . Hold your Tongue , <font> Jack . <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,49.894

Y. Clackit . I am Dumb . GARRICK-1759-2,49.895

- I can@ @not be deceived in his Conduct . GARRICK-1759-2,50.905

- Modesty may tye the Tongue of our Sex , GARRICK-1759-2,50.906

but Silence in him could proceed only from Contempt .
GARRICK-1759-2,50.907

Sir Charles . How prettily she reproaches me ! GARRICK-1759-2,50.908

- But I@ @'ll soon make it up with her . GARRICK-1759-2,50.909

Miss Harriet . As to that Letter , Sir ; your Error there , is

GARRICK-1759-2,50.911

- Now is my Time to begin . GARRICK-1759-2,51.916

- Hem ! - hem ! - Sweet young Lady , - hem ! - whose Charms are so
mighty , so far transcending every thing we read of , in History or
Fable , how could you possibly think that my Silence proceeded from
Contempt ? GARRICK-1759-2,51.917

Was it natural or prudent , think you , for a Man of sixty-five , nay ,
just entering into his sixty-sixth year - GARRICK-1759-2,51.918

Y. Clackit . <font> O Misericorde ! <$$font> What , is my Uncle my
Rival ! GARRICK-1759-2,51.919

Nay then I shall burst , by <font> Jupiter ! <$$font> - Ha ! ha ! ha
! GARRICK-1759-2,51.920

Miss Harriet . Do@ @n't imagine , Sir , that to me your Age is any
Fault . GARRICK-1759-2,51.921

Sir Charles <paren> <font> Bowing . <$$font> <$$paren> You are very
obliging , Madam . GARRICK-1759-2,51.922

Miss Harriet . Neither is it , Sir , a Merit of that extraordinary
Nature , that I should sacrifice to it an Inclination which I have
conceived for another . GARRICK-1759-2,51.923

Sir Charles . How is this ? GARRICK-1759-2,51.924

Y. Clackit . Another ! not you . - GARRICK-1759-2,51.925

mind that , Uncle . GARRICK-1759-2,51.926

Lucy . What is the Meaning of all this ! GARRICK-1759-2,51.927

<P_52>

Y. Clackit . Proof positive , Uncle - And very positive .
GARRICK-1759-2,52.929

Sir Charles . I have been led into a Mistake , Madam , which I hope you
will excuse ; GARRICK-1759-2,52.930

and I have made myself very ridiculous , which I hope I shall forget :
GARRICK-1759-2,52.931

- And so , Madam , I am your humble Servant . GARRICK-1759-2,52.932

- This young Lady has something very extraordinary about her .
GARRICK-1759-2,52.933

Heartly . What I now see and the Remembrance of what is past force me
to break Silence . GARRICK-1759-2,52.934

Y. Clackit . Ay , now for it . GARRICK-1759-2,52.935

Hear him - GARRICK-1759-2,52.936

hear him . GARRICK-1759-2,52.937

- Heartly . O my <font> Harriet ! <$$font> - I too must be disgrac'd
in my Turn . GARRICK-1759-2,52.938

- Can you think that I have seen and convers'd with you unmov'd ?
GARRICK-1759-2,52.939

- Indeed I have not . GARRICK-1759-2,52.940

- The more I was sensible of your Merit , the stronger were my Motives
to stifle the Ambition of my Heart . GARRICK-1759-2,52.941

- But now I can no longer resist the Violence of my Passion , which
casts me at your Feet , the most unworthy indeed of all your Admirers ,
but of all the most affectionate . GARRICK-1759-2,52.942

Y. Clackit . So , so , the Moon has changed , GARRICK-1759-2,52.943

and the grown Gentlemen begin to be frisky . GARRICK-1759-2,52.944

Lucy . What , my Master in Love too ! GARRICK-1759-2,52.945

- I@ @'ll never trust these Tye_Wigs again . <paren> <font> Aside .
<$$font> <$$paren> GARRICK-1759-2,52.946

<P_53>

Miss Harriet . I have refused my Hand to Sir <font> Charles <$$font>
and this young Gentleman : GARRICK-1759-2,53.948

- The one accuses me of Caprice , the other of Singularity .
GARRICK-1759-2,53.949

- Should I refuse my Hand a third Time , <paren> <font> smiling <$$font>
<$$paren> I might draw upon myself a more severe Reproach ,
GARRICK-1759-2,53.950

- and therefore I accept your Favour , Sir , GARRICK-1759-2,53.951

and will endeavour to deserve it . GARRICK-1759-2,53.952

Heartly . And thus I seal my Acknowledgments , GARRICK-1759-2,53.953

and from henceforth devote my every Thought , and all my Services to the
Author of my Happiness . GARRICK-1759-2,53.954

<paren> <font> Kisses her hand . <$$font> <$$paren>
GARRICK-1759-2,53.955

Lucy . Since Matters are so well settled , give me leave , Sir , to
congratulate you on your Success , - and my young Lady on her Judgment .
GARRICK-1759-2,53.956

- You have my Taste exactly , Miss ; GARRICK-1759-2,53.957

ripe Fruit for my Money ; GARRICK-1759-2,53.958

when it is too green it sets one's Teeth on edge , GARRICK-1759-2,53.959

and when too mellow it has no Flavour at all . GARRICK-1759-2,53.960

Sir Charles . Hold your Tongue , you Baggage , <paren> <font> to
<$$font> Lucy . <$$paren> GARRICK-1759-2,53.961

Well , my dear discreet Nephew , are you satisfied with the Fool's Part
you have given me , and play'd yourself , in the Farce ?
GARRICK-1759-2,53.962

Y. Clackit . What would you have me say , Sir ? GARRICK-1759-2,53.963

I am too much a Philosopher to fret myself , because the Wind , which
was East this Morning , is now West . GARRICK-1759-2,53.964

- The poor Girl in pique has kill'd herself , to be reveng'd on me ;
GARRICK-1759-2,53.965

but hark'@ @ye , Sir , GARRICK-1759-2,53.966

I believe <font> Heartly <$$font> will be cursed mad to have me live in
his Neighbourhood . GARRICK-1759-2,53.967

- A Word to the Wise . GARRICK-1759-2,53.968

- <P_54> Sir Charles . Thou hast a most incorrigible Vanity , <font>
Jack <$$font> , GARRICK-1759-2,54.969

and nothing can cure thee . GARRICK-1759-2,54.970

- Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font> , I have Sense enough , and Friendship
enough , not to be uneasy at your Happiness . GARRICK-1759-2,54.971

Heartly . I hope , Sir <font> Charles <$$font> , that we shall still
continue to live as Neighbours and Friends . GARRICK-1759-2,54.972

For you , my <font> Harriet <$$font> , Words can@ @not express my Wonder
or my Joy ; GARRICK-1759-2,54.973

my future Conduct must tell you what a Sense I have of my Happiness ,
and how much I shall endeavour to deserve it . GARRICK-1759-2,54.974

My friendly Care shall change to grateful Love , and the fond Husband
still the Guardian prove . GARRICK-1759-2,54.975

Finis . GARRICK-1759-2,54.976
