<font> John Dowding <$$font> , <paren> sworn <$$paren> Examined by
<font> Mr. Law . <$$font> CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.5

<$$heading>

<font> Q. <$$font> In the month of September , 1794 where did you live
and work ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.7

<font> A. <$$font> I worked with Mr. Penton , in New-street-square ,
No. 32 CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.8

<font> Q. <$$font> What is Mr. Penton's business ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.9

<font> A. <$$font> A brass-founder . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.10

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember being in his employment on the 8th
of September , 1794 ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.11

<font> A. <$$font> Perfectly well . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.12

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect on that day any men coming to his
house , who were not known to you ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.13

<font> A. <$$font> I was called down on the 8th of September , by the
clerk ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.14

when I came down into the counting-house there were three men standing
there . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.15

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect any thing particular of the person
of one of them ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.16

<font> A. <$$font> One of them was a lame man ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.17

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see that man afterwards so as to enable you
now to say who that lame man was ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.18

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.19

<font> Q. <$$font> Who was that lame man ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.20

<font> A. <$$font> Upton - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.21

one of the others was a tall man . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.22

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you now know who the other two men were ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.23

<font> A. <$$font> Not to my knowledge . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.24

<font> Q. <$$font> If you saw them again should you recollect them ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.25

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.26

<font> Q. <$$font> What did they ask you for ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.27

<font> A. <$$font> When I came into the counting-house they asked me if
I could make them a tube , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.28

I asked them what sort of a tube , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,35.29

they said it was to be three foot long , the eighth of an inch thick ,
<P_36> five-eighths of an inch inside the bore , and to be seven-eighths
the outside ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.30

it was to be quite perfect , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.31

and the inside was to be quite a smooth cylinder .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.32

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you , upon that , shew them any part of a tube ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.33

<font> A. <$$font> I asked them what sort of a tube it was to be -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.34

they asked me what the price would be - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.35

I told them I could not tell - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.36

they asked me if I could tell to a few shillings -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.37

I told them I could not , as my master was not within -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.38

then I shewed them a piece of a tube . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.39

<font> Q. <$$font> Was that the piece of tube you shewed them ? <font>
<paren> shewing the witness a brass tube <$$paren> . <$$font>
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.40

<font> A. <$$font> It was a piece of a similar size ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.41

they said that would do if it was smaller inside , that it was of the
right size the outside , but it must be thicker , and then the bore
would be less . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.42

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you ask what it was for ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.43

<font> A. <$$font> I did not then , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.44

they asked me then if I could not tell them nearly what the price would
be ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.45

I told them no , I could not , because it was an out-of-the-way job ,
and I must make tools on purpose to make it ; that I must make a tool to
draw it on , to make it smooth inside . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.46

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you ask them what was to be the use of it ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.47

<font> A. <$$font> I told them if they would tell me the use of it , I
could be a better judge how to make it , and , perhaps , could make it
better for their use ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.48

they answered , it was a secret ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.49

it was Upton made answer it was a secret , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.50

and the others seemed to agree with him , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.51

they all seemed to be in one voice , saying , that it was a secret ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.52

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you undertake the job ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.53

<font> A. <$$font> I did not . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.54

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you give any reason why you would not undertake
it ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.55

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; - When I was talking of making things for it ,
he asked me if I knew what the price of it would be ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.56

I said I could not tell the price of it . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.57

<font> Q. <$$font> Relate what more passed when you were present ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,36.58

<font> A. <$$font> When they asked me about the price , I told them it
was rather an out-of-the-way job , and that to make it quite parallel
<P_37> in the inside , I must make tools on purpose to make it ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.59

they asked me how much the expence would be , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.60

I told them I could not tell ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.61

they asked me if I could not tell to a few shillings ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.62

I said I could not , that my master was not within , and I was very busy
myself ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.63

I told them at last that it was a job not worth while undertaking as I
was quite busy ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.64

I told them then as I said before , that if they would tell me the use
of it , I could be a better judge how to make it , and , perhaps , could
make it better for their use , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.65

they answered me it was a secret . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.66

- Then they produced a piece of tube that they had bought before at our
house , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.67

and had some money returned , which was , I think , ten-pence ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.68

the money was returned to Upton . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.69

<font> Q. <$$font> Who did they deliver that back to ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.70

<font> A. <$$font> To me ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.71

but the clerk returned the money . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.72

<font> Q. <$$font> What is his name ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.73

<font> A. <$$font> Mason ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.74

but he is not in our service now ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.75

it was such a bit of tube as this , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.76

it was of the same size . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.77

<font> Q. <$$font> Did they all seem to be concerned in the same
business ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.78

<font> A. <$$font> They appeared to be of the same sort .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.79

<font> Q. <$$font> You stated , that what one said , the rest assented
to ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.80

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; they seemed to be the same company ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.81

what one said the others stood to ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.82

but as to taking my oath to the people I can@ @not , if I was to see
them perhaps . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.83

<font> Q. <$$font> what passed after returning the tube ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.84

<font> A. <$$font> Nothing else passed , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.85

they went away . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.86

<heading>

<font> John Dowding , <$$font> Cross-examined by <font> Mr. Adam .
<$$font> CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.88

<$$heading>

<font> Q. <$$font> This you say passed on the 8th of September , 1794 ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.90

. <font> A. <$$font> Yes ; our books will shew it .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.91

<font> Q. <$$font> Three persons came together ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.92

<font> A. <$$font> They were together when I came down ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.93

I can@ @not say whether they came together into the counting-house .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.94

<font> Q. <$$font> The only one of these that you can speak to
positively is Upton ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.95

<font> A. <$$font> I never saw any of the rest .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.96

<font> Q. <$$font> You never saw any of the others either before or
since ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,37.97

<P_38>

<font> A. <$$font> Upton I have seen since . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.99

I can swear to him . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.100

<font> Q. <$$font> But the two others you had not seen before nor since
? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.101

<font> A. <$$font> Not to my knowledge . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.102

<font> Q. <$$font> You talk of a tube that they had got at your house
being brought back , and ten-pence being returned to them ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.103

what do you mean by that - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.104

do you mean the same three persons ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.105

<font> A. <$$font> There was but one person returned it ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.106

all three could not join hand in hand . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.107

<font> Q. <$$font> Were all the three persons together , at the time of
returning it ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.108

<font> A. <$$font> They were as close as I am to this gentleman next me
. CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.109

<font> Q. <$$font> When did they get the tube that they returned ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.110

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.111

<font> Q. <$$font> How can you tell that they got that at your house ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.112

<font> A. <$$font> The clerk returned the money to them .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.113

<font> Q. <$$font> You can@ @not say any thing , of your own knowledge
, about the tube that was returned . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.114

- There was a tube got from your house ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.115

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; or we should not have returned the money to
them . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.116

<font> Q. <$$font> Got by Upton ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.117

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say which of them got it
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.118

<font> Q. <$$font> The money was returned at that time ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.119

<font> A. <$$font> It was . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.120

<font> Q. <$$font> You say Upton was the person who spoke ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.121

<font> A. <$$font> He was the person that spoke the most , the rest
joining sometimes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.122

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect any thing particularly that Upton
said ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.123

<font> A. <$$font> He was the person who spoke to me when I came down ,
and asked me if I could make a piece of tube . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.124

<font> Q. <$$font> Then you discoursed about the price of it ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.125

<font> A. <$$font> Not then , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.126

it was afterwards . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.127

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you ask any particular price ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.128

<font> A. <$$font> I asked no price at all , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.129

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you say it would be a thing of great cost ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.130

<font> A. <$$font> I said it would be expensive .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.131

<font> Q. <$$font> When they asked how much expence , did you say how
much ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,38.132

<P_39>

<font> A. <$$font> No . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.134

<font> Q. <$$font> Then you gave them no idea of , whether it would
cost them a guinea , five guineas , or ten guineas ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.135

<font> A. <$$font> Being a journeyman I could not tell .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.136

<font> Q. <$$font> The discussion about the price was quite general ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.137

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.138

<font> Q. <$$font> Can you swear , positively , that these persons were
present during the whole conversation between you and Upton ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.139

<font> A. <$$font> I can swear , positively , that there were three in
the room all the time . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.140

<font> Q. <$$font> Are there not women employed in your house in
lackering brass ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.141

<font> A. <$$font> There are . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.142

<font> Q. <$$font> Does the operation of lackering brass go on in the
same place , or in an adjoining one ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.143

<font> A. <$$font> In the same house . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.144

<font> Q. <$$font> In the same apartment ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.145

<font> A. <$$font> Not in the same room . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.146

<font> Q. <$$font> Therefore , if any of these persons went to a woman
that was lackering brass , of course they must have been in a different
apartment from that in which the conversation is supposed to have passed
with you ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.147

<font> A. <$$font> They did not go out while I talked with them ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.148

they might before I came down - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.149

to my knowledge they did not - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.150

I did not see any of them go there . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.151

<font> Q. <$$font> You can@ @not speak to the persons of the other two
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.152

you never saw them before ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.153

<font> A. <$$font> Not to my knowledge . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.154

<font> Q. <$$font> Nor since ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.155

<font> A. <$$font> Not to my knowledge . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.156

<font> Q. <$$font> And the thing went off entirely upon your saying ,
it ' could not be done but at some certain expence ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.157

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.158

<font> Q. <$$font> Of the three , Upton was the person who spoke most ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.159

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.160

<font> Q. <$$font> I think you said , that when it was told you it was
a secret , it came from Upton's voice ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,39.161

<P_40>

<font> A. <$$font> I did not hear them all , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.163

but I can swear Upton said that CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.164

but they were all just together . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.165

<font> Q. <$$font> The two other persons did not say any thing that you
can charge your memory with ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.166

<font> A. <$$font> No , I can@ @not . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.167

<font> Q. <$$font> Did they say any thing about its being a secret ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.168

<font> A. <$$font> It was just as they were going away it was said it
was a secret . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.169

<font> Q. <$$font> And its being a secret came from Upton's voice , and
not from either of the others ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.170

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not swear to any other person's voice ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.171

they all seemed to join together , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.172

but Upton's voice I heard in particular . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.173

- As for the others voices I can@ @not tell . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.174

{TEXT:Cock_Lane} , Snow Hill ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.178

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.179

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember being applied to , in the month of
September , 1794 , to attend any persons in respect to a brass tube that
was wanted ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.180

<font> A. <$$font> I do . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.181

<font> Q. <$$font> Can you recollect what day of the month it was ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.182

<font> A. <$$font> No . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.183

<font> Q. <$$font> What day of the week ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.184

<font> A. <$$font> No . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.185

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect what hour of the day ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.186

<font> A. <$$font> It was some time after dinner , I believe .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.187

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember what part of the month the
anniversary of his Majesty's coronation falls in ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.188

<font> A. <$$font> On the 22d of September . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.189

<font> Q. <$$font> Was it before or after the 22d of September ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.190

<font> A. <$$font> Being called in January , 1795 , I made an enquiry
among the men . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.191

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> Do not tell us any thing that is the mere
effect of information of others , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,40.192

- But have you , after an enquiry , <P_41> been able to satisfy your own
mind in what part of the month it was ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.193

<font> A. <$$font> Not at all . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.194

<font> Q. <$$font> What time of the day was it ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.195

<font> A. <$$font> I believe immediately after dinner ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.196

<font> Q. <$$font> You were called by your servant to attend to these
persons ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.197

<font> A. <$$font> By my apprentice , James Hubbart .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.198

<font> Q. <$$font> How many people came to you ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.199

<font> A. <$$font> Three persons . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.200

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you make any observation upon the person of any
one of them ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.201

<font> A. <$$font> One I observed to be a lame man .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.202

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you observe whether he had any iron on or not ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.203

<font> A. <$$font> No ; I observed one to limp as he was going out at
the door . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.204

<font> Q. <$$font> Relate what passed between you and those persons .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.205

<font> A. <$$font> They asked , first of all , for a long pistol-barrel
; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.206

I produced a musketoon-barrel to them : CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.207

it was observed that would not do , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.208

they did not want it plugged up at the end ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.209

from that I observed , that I apprehended it must be a straight cylinder
that they wanted ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.210

they said it was ; that it must be about five-eighths of an inch
diameter in the bore , and the eighth of an inch thick ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.211

and they said , if I would cast it , and bore it , they would finish it
themselves . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.212

I told them , I should not undertake to do it without they brought a
pattern ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.213

one of them observed , would not a rocket-case do ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.214

I said it would , if they plugged up the end . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.215

<font> Q. <$$font> That was for a model ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.216

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.217

<font> Q. <$$font> What was to be the length ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.218

<font> A. <$$font> There was no length specified at that time ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.219

they went away after that . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.220

I believe one of them asked how long it would take making , to which I
answered about three days . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.221

<font> Q. <$$font> During the time these persons were with you , did
they all take a share in the conversation , or was it confined to any
one of them ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,41.222

<P_42>

<font> A. <$$font> The lame man seemed to be the principal .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,42.224

<font> Q. <$$font> Did the others interfere in the course of the
conversation ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,42.225

<font> A. <$$font> I know it was not the lame man that asked me as to
the time when it might be done . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,42.226

<font> Q. <$$font> In general it was the lame man that conversed with

CROSSFIELD-1796-2,43.279

CROSSFIELD-1796-2,43.280

if they wanted a barrel they must apply to the clock-makers ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,43.282

or if they wanted a tube they must apply to those that draw tubes .

CROSSFIELD-1796-2,44.285

<font> A. <$$font> I was never acquainted with Palmer ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,44.303

CROSSFIELD-1796-2,44.320

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , very well . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,44.321

<font> Q. <$$font> What led you to call upon him ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,44.322

<font> A. <$$font> I called upon him on purpose to subscribe a little
money <P_45> for the wives and children of those people that were in
prison under suspicion of High Treason . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.323

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember at that time having any conversation
with him ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.324

<font> A. <$$font> Very little at that time , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.325

<font> Q. <$$font> Does that little dwell upon your memory ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.326

<font> A. <$$font> It was so insignificant that I took no notice of it
: CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.327

- I do not know what parted at all the first time ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.328

the second time I called upon him on purpose to know how the
subscription went on ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.329

instead of answering concerning the subscription , he answered me
concerning the Corresponding Society . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.330

<font> Q. <$$font> We wo@ @n't go at large into that .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.331

- Was there any thing that led to the production of any instrument ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.332

<font> A. <$$font> No such a thing . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.333

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember calling upon him during Bartholomew
fair ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.334

<font> A. <$$font> I had given him an invitation when I first called
there , seeing he was a watch-maker , to come and look at an engine of
mine , which I thought very likely might be a treat to him , as being in
that line ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.335

it was rather out of the way , as such , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.336

he did come ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.337

that was nearly about Bartholomew fair time ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.338

the distance between the times that I had called on him and that time I
can@ @not well determine , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.339

but the way that I know that he called upon me at Bartholomew fair time
was , a son of mine was lying ill at that time , and I remember very
well he was making an observation - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.340

<font> Q. <$$font> We must not hear what your son observed to you ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.341

but , when you saw Upton , do you recollect having any particular
conversation with him about the power of air ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.342

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , exactly so ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.343

he saw an air-pump lying in my shop , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.344

I explained it to him in the Best manner I could ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.345

I shewed him an air-gun , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.346

and explained it in the Best manner I could . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.347

<font> Q. <$$font> After having explained it to him , did he come again
to look at this air-gun ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.348

<font> A. <$$font> He did , next day . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.349

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he come alone ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.350

<font> A. <$$font> No , there was a man with him .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,45.351

<P_46>

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect any thing particular about the man
that came with him ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.353

<font> A. <$$font> No ; Upton had displeased me in his conversation in
the second interview I had with him , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.354

and therefore I neither liked him nor his acquaintance .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.355

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you observe any thing particular about the hand
of that person ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.356

<font> A. <$$font> No - the gentleman that came with him told me he was
very fond of shooting , and that he had lost some of his fingers by the
explosion of a gun ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.357

but whether he had or had not , I do not know , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.358

for I did not look at his hand ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.359

I was rather disgusted with Mr. Upton as I said before ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.360

and I did not pay any regard to him nor his acquaintance .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.361

<font> Q. <$$font> But he said his hand had received an injury by the
explosion of a gun ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.362

<font> A. <$$font> He did . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.363

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he handle the gun , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.364

or what did he do ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.365

<font> A. <$$font> He viewed it , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.366

and said it was a handsome piece . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.367

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he apply to you to do any job for him ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.368

<font> A. <$$font> Upton asked me if I wanted a job ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.369

I replied I had got more business than I could do .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.370

<font> Q. <$$font> The person who was with him was by at the time when
he asked you to take this job ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.371

<font> A. <$$font> The person that was with him was on the outside of
the door CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.372

and he was in the door-way , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.373

it was just as he was leaving the house . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.374

<font> Q. <$$font> That man is the person that handled the air-gun ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.375

<font> A. <$$font> He did . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.376

<font> Q. <$$font> And praised it ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.377

<font> A. <$$font> He did as a handsome piece , which it really was .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.378

<font> Q. <$$font> Had you any conversation with him about the
properties of air ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.379

<font> A. <$$font> Not a word , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.380

I was at dinner - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.381

I did not get up from my seat all the time they were there , till they
were just a going , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.382

and that was merely because I thought they stopped too long .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,46.383

<P_47>

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you seen the man who came with Upton any where
since ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.385

<font> A. <$$font> Never in my life , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.386

nor I do@ @n't think I should have known him six hours or three hours
after he left my place , I took so little notice of him .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.387

<font> Q. <$$font> You had so great a dislike to Upton that you would
not let yourself know the persons that came with him ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.388

<font> A. <$$font> I did not take notice of him ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.389

nor I do not know that I should have known him if I had met him in the
street a minute after . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.390

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see any person afterwards with Upton before
the Privy Council ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.391

<font> A. <$$font> No ; I never saw Upton at all at the Privy Council .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.392

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see any person before the Privy Council who
had lost any of his fingers ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.393

<font> A. <$$font> Not that I know of ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.394

I was at the Privy Council when Mr. Dundas presided ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.395

and there was a man of the name of Dennis , a sailor , in the lobby ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.396

at the same time a man came out , he said there he goes -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.397

I asked who ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.398

why , said he , Crossfield - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.399

said I , do you know him - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.400

Yes , said he , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.401

damn his eyes I would know his ashes was he burnt , or any such damned
rascal as he was ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.402

so I understood that to be the man . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.403

<font> Q. <$$font> I do not ask you to declarations of other people ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.404

but I ask you whether you did not see a person who had a defect in his
fingers , where the Privy Council were sitting ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.405

<font> A. <$$font> No ; I took the man that came with Upton to me , to
be a taller man - almost as tall as Mr. White .

it is all supposition , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,47.412

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,48.416

from what passed on the spot ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,51.517

what passed there ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,51.518

it was something in the way of his own business .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,51.520

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see any thing produced at the

<P_53>

<font> Q. <$$font> Was there any conversation there about a brass tube
and its dimensions ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.584

<font> A. <$$font> I have no recollection of any thing of that kind .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.585

<font> Q. <$$font> Recollect that you are upon your oath ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.586

<font> A. <$$font> I know that perfectly well ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.587

and therefore I shall say nothing but the truth .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.588

<font> Q. <$$font> Was there any conversation about a model ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.589

<font> A. <$$font> There might be such conversation pass ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.590

but I do not know whether there did or not . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.591

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you mean to swear you do not recollect any thing
about a model for a brass tube - about its dimensions - or how it was to
be applied ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.592

<font> A. <$$font> I do swear I do not recollect about the particular
business . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.593

<font> Q. <$$font> I am not asking you about particulars ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.594

but give us some information of what passed ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.595

was any brass tube produced by any body ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.596

<font> A. <$$font> I have no recollection that there was .

<font> A. <$$font> I recollect I saw that at the Privy Council ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.599

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you never see this before , as a subject upon
which persons were conversing at the time you saw it ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.600

<font> A. <$$font> I do not recollect that I did .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.601

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you ever see these before ? <font> <paren>
shewing the witness the model <$$paren> <$$font>

<font> A. <$$font> I have . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.606

<font> Q. <$$font> Upon your oath can@ @not you venture to swear to his
hand_writing ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.609

<font> A. <$$font> There is but one thing that I can swear to his hand
by , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.610

that is the signing of his name . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.611

<font> Q. <$$font> You have frequently seen him write ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,53.612

<P_54>

<font> A. <$$font> I have . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.614

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you ever corresponded with him ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.615

<font> A. <$$font> I never received five letters from Mr. Crossfield
in the course of my acquaintance with him , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.616

<font> Q. <$$font> Look at this paper , <font> <paren> shewing it to
the witness <$$paren> <$$font> CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.617

and tell me whose hand-writing you believe that to be ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.618

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not swear to this hand-writing .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.619

<font> Q. <$$font> I do not ask you to swear to it ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.620

and you who are an attorney know I do not - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.621

upon the oath you have taken whose hand-writing do you believe that to
be ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.622

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not swear to a belief of this hand-writing .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.623

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you mean to swear that you have no belief upon
the subject ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.624

<font> A. <$$font> I have not . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.625

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you mean to swear that you believe that is or not
the hand-writing of a man you are acquainted with ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.626

<font> A. <$$font> I do not know enough of it to be able to form an
opinion upon it . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.627

<font> Q. <$$font> Now open this paper CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.628

and look at it ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.629

have you ever seen it before ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.630

<font> A. <$$font> I do not know upon my word .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.631

<font> Q. <$$font> I am sorry to be obliged so often to admonish you ,
that you are upon your oath ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.632

<font> A. <$$font> You might save yourself all that trouble ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.633

I know it very well . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.634

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> You recollect that when you
answer upon your word , that is not exactly answering on the obligation
that you are speaking under , that was the occasion of your being
reminded that you are upon your oath ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.635

<font> A. <$$font> I consider that when I first came into Court , I was
sworn to speak the truth . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.636

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> But it is not the proper
manner of answering ; to say upon my word it may be so and so .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.637

<font> A. <$$font> It may not be a proper way of answering ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.638

but I consider that every thing I am saying in this Court , I am saying
upon my oath . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.639

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> Then upon the oath you have taken , have
you ever seen that paper before ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,54.640

<P_55>

<font> A. <$$font> There were some papers shewn me before the Privy
Council , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.642

whether this is one I can@ @not tell ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.643

upon my oath I do not know ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.644

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you the least doubt that that paper was shewn
to you before the Privy Council , that you was interrogated to the
subject , and that you gave answers respecting it ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.645

<font> A. <$$font> I do not know whether this piece of paper was shewn
me or not ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.646

there were some pieces of paper shewn me . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.647

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you mean to swear now , that you have no belief
whose hand-writing that is , after looking at it ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.648

<font> A. <$$font> I can form no belief about it .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.649

<font> Q. <$$font> You can@ @not be sure that you ever saw this paper
before I handed it to you ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.650

<font> A. <$$font> No . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.651

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you ever seen any paper which appeared to you
to describe the same subject ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.652

I am not speaking of your examination at the Privy Council ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.653

but had you before you were examined by the Privy Council seen a paper
containing such drawings as I have shewn you ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.654

I tell you now that I have your examination in my hand -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.655

upon your oath had you before your examination by the Privy Council ever
seen , and I shall ask you presently in whose custody , any paper with
similar drawings to this ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.656

<font> A. <$$font> I do not recollect any thing of the kind .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.657

<font> Q. <$$font> Are you equal to the swearing that you never had ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.658

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not swear that I never saw such ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.659

but I have no recollection of any thing of the kind .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.660

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you any belief of the kind ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.661

<font> A. <$$font> I can form no belief . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.662

<font> Q. <$$font> I ask you once more upon your oath have you never
said when you was upon your oath , that you had seen a paper similar to
that ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.663

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> Does your Lordship think this is the proper
way of examining a witness in chief ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.664

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> The whole course of this
species of examination is not regular . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.665

This is a witness for the Crown , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,55.666

if he disgraces himself , which it is the tendency of this examination
<P_56> to make him do , they lose the benefit of his testimony .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.667

The idea of extracting truth from a witness for the Crown who disgraces
himself , is in my apprehension , and always has been , a thing
perfectly impracticable , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.668

for the moment he has gone to the length of discrediting his testimony ,
by the manner in which he shuffles with your examination , there is an
end of all credit to him . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.669

You recollect upon a very solemn occasion , the Judges were all of
opinion , that that kind of examination on the part of a prosecution was
improper , for that it always ended in destroying the credit of your own
witness . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.670

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> My object was to refresh his memory .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.671

Be so good as look at this paper CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.672

<font> <paren> another paper <$$paren> <$$font> CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.673

do you know it CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.674

<font> A. <$$font> I do not . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.675

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect ever seeing it before ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.676

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say I recollect ever seeing it before ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.677

but it appears to me to be a paper similar to what was shewn me at the
Privy Council . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.678

<font> Q. <$$font> You are correct in that - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.679

that is the paper that was shewn to you before the Privy Council -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.680

supposing that to be the same paper , do you recollect ever to have seen
it before it was shewn to you at the Privy Council ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,56.681

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> Do you recollect any thing that passed
between you and Crossfield respecting this journey to Bristol ?

<font> A. <$$font> I know Crossfield intended to go to Bristol three or
four months before that time , to see whether it would be an eligible
place for him to settle in as a physician ; and that he intended to make
some experiments upon the Bristol and Bath waters , which he thought
might be of service to him in his medical capacity ,

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , every day . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,65.935

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he go about publicly ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,65.936

<font> A. <$$font> As publicly as any man could possibly do .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,65.937

<font> Q. <$$font> You left him at Bristol , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,65.938

days - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,65.949

. CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.963

was before he went abroad ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.964

was it on the day you was last examined before the Privy Council ,

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.966

CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.967

CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.975

<font> A. <$$font> At my first examination , I think , it was .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.976

<font> Q. <$$font> How often , between your first and your third
examination , did Crossfield visit your chambers ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.977

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.978

<font> Q <$$font> Was it daily ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.979

<font> A. <$$font> No , it might be once or twice ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.980

when I say once or twice , I do not mean to say that he was no more than
twice at my chambers - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.981

I can@ @not particularly say the number of times .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.982

<font> Q. <$$font> The last time you saw him was on the day on which
you concluded your examination before the Privy Council , after you had
been examined ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.983

<font> A. <$$font> I think it was before I attended the Council .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.984

<font> Q. <$$font> You saw him , probably , in the early part of the
day , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.985

and was examined afterwards by the Privy Council ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.987

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.988

<font> Q. <$$font> There is one other thing I wish to have explained .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,66.989

- You <P_67> said Crossfield went to Bristol with a view to see whether
that was an eligible situation for him to settle in as a physician ; and
to try some experiments upon the Bristol and Bath waters .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.990

Did he announce himself as a physician newly arrived at Bristol , or at
Bath ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.991

<font> A. <$$font> He did not go to practice as a physician ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.992

he went to see whether Bristol would be an eligible situation for him to
practise as a physician . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.993

<font> Q. <$$font> There is one thing more that may be mistaken unless
I put a question upon it . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.994

- In your answer to Mr. Adam , you said that before he went for Bristol
, he was publicly about here in town ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.995

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.996

<font> Q. <$$font> And , I think , you said that though you enquired of
him , after his return , you never learned from him where his residence
was ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.997

<font> A. <$$font> No . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.998

<font> Q. <$$font> And you only saw him at your own chambers ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.999

<font> A. <$$font> Certainly ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.1000

and the reason he assigned to me was - . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.1001

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> I do not ask your reasons .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.1002

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> It is part of the explanation
. CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.1003

<font> A. <$$font> The reason he stated was this -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.1004

I told him the circumstance of my being summoned before the Privy
Council at the first time ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.1005

and I acquainted him that his attendance was likewise required ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.1006

he told me he was engaged to go abroad as the surgeon of a ship ; that
he had no kind of objection to attend the Privy Council ; but he knew
nothing of the matter then before the Council ; and that his staying in
town would be the means of detaining him from going the voyage .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.1007

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> You explained to him that the Privy
Council wished much that he should attend , and that you had promised to
procure his attendance as a witness ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.1008

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.1009

<font> Q. <$$font> To which he answered , that knowing nothing of the
affairs that were transacted there , and being engaged to go abroad , he
should go , and not continue any longer in town for that purpose ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,67.1010

<P_68>

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,68.1012

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you ever communicate , in either of your
examinations , to the Privy Council , that the gentleman did not attend
because it was inconvenient to his affairs ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,68.1013

<font> A. <$$font> My examination will shew that .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,68.1014

<font> Q. <$$font> Or whether your examination did not close without
the Privy Council having the least conception , from any thing you
stated to them , that you knew where to find Crossfield ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,68.1015

<font> A. <$$font> I certainly did not know where to find him .

but they made a sketch of it . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,69.1042

<font> Q. <$$font> Look at this paper , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,69.1043

- CROSSFIELD-1796-2,71.1117

were there any imputations thrown upon Upton's character in the
Corresponding Society ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,71.1118

<font> A. <$$font> There were . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,71.1119

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know any of the persons who were principally
concerned in throwing those imputations - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,71.1120

was Mr. Le Maitre active in that ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,71.1121

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say exactly ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,71.1122

Higgins said something which affronted Upton , when they were about to
investigate his character . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,71.1123

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you present at any other meeting when any
person whatever brought any charges against Upton ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,71.1124

<font> Mr. Law . <$$font> I object to that question .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,71.1125

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> The object of the examination
is , to fix that Upton had , for some reasons , which they mean to shew
, conceived malice against some of those persons .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,71.1126

<font> Mr. Law . <$$font> I submit they are to get at that object by
regular means . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,71.1127

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> The means they propose is ,
to shew that some of these people made some charges against Upton , in
<P_72> consequence of which the former witness said Upton was disgraced
. CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1128

<font> Mr. Law . <$$font> I do not object to any thing that is asked
respecting Le Maitre , or any body by name , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1129

but the question is put in general . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1130

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> In general , unless it can be
followed by something , personal to some one of these people , it
amounts to nothing ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1131

but the examination has already gone to Le Maitre being one of the
persons . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1132

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> I assure your Lordship I abstained from
mentioning the names of any one of the prisoners , that it might not be
said I put the words in his mouth ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1133

but as that gives rise to an objection , I will put my questions more
directly . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1134

- Do you remember whether , pending that examination into Upton's
character , you heard Higgins say any thing in the Society respecting
Upton's character ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1135

<font> A. <$$font> Upton was going to save the Society the trouble of
expelling him - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1136

he was going to take himself away ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1137

with that Higgins said , there he hops off ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1138

he affronted Upton directly , because it was casting a reflection upon
his lameness . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1139

<font> Q. <$$font> Were there , or were there not , expressions of
violent animosity passing between Le Maitre , Higgins , Smith , and
Upton , in the Society ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1140

<font> A. <$$font> There was some animosity between them ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1141

but I did not particularly notice what it arose from , nor how it ended
. CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1142

<font> Q. <$$font> In point of fact , were Le Maitre , Smith , and
Higgins , pursuing any enquiry into the character of Upton ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1143

<font> A. <$$font> Not as I know of . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1144

<font> Q. <$$font> At any time after you had delivered this model to
Upton , did he call upon you at your house , after Le Maitre , Higgins ,
and Smith were apprehended ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1145

<font> A. <$$font> After Upton was apprehended himself , on the Sunday
, he called upon me . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1146

<font> Q. <$$font> How long before that had he himself been taken up ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1147

<font> A. <$$font> Only on the Saturday night , according to his own
account CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1148

<font> Q. <$$font> What did Upton then say to you respecting Le Maitre
? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,72.1149

<P_73>

<font> Mr. Attorney . <$$font> I would just intimate Mr. Gurney ,
that I have not offered any evidence of acts or declarations of Upton ,
unless in the presence of the prisoner . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1151

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> Your Lordship has already observed the
object of my cross-examination is , to prove the animosity in Upton's
mind respecting some of the persons in this indictment ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1152

I am going to ask a question to point out that animosity , by shewing
something Upton said concerning one of those persons .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1153

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> The difficulty of the case is
, that at present there is nothing , properly speaking , from Upton , in
evidence , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1154

and therefore your shewing that Upton had animosity against any of these
Prisoners , is rather going before the point ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1155

it will be better for you to examine to that in case they can establish
any declaration of Upton's which will be evidence against your client ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1156

then it will be proper for you to shew that Upton had malice against
your client . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1157

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> If your Lordship will direct the witness
to retire for a minute , I will state the object of my question more
particularly . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1158

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> I submit to your Lordship that the line of
examination Mr. Gurney is now following up is admissible in the present
stage of the cause . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1159

Your Lordship will observe that this indictment lays , as the
Attorney_General has stated , a conspiracy to take away the life of the
King ; that there are counts that contain an allegation of conspiracy ;
and , as the Attorney_General stated , there is likewise part of the
indictment which contains no allegation of conspiracy ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1160

the prisoner is brought up upon the whole of the indictment ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1161

and he has pleaded to the whole of the indictment :
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1162

what part of the indictment is to be submitted to the consideration of
the Jury as proved and what part of the indictment is to be submitted as
not proved , is what it is impossible for me at the present moment to
know . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1163

All that I know at present is , that the prisoner stands indicted with
having conspired with three others , who are known , and with others who
are not known to the Grand Jury , for the purpose of taking away the
life of the King ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,73.1164

and it is particularly alledged in the different overt acts , with
regard to the preparation of this instrument , which is supposed to be
made for that particular purpose , and with regard <P_74> to the
consultations supposed to have been had among the parties , that this
Upton , whom my learned friend has stated to be in the other world , and
whom , therefore , he can@ @not produce as a witness - that Upton is one
of the principal , but the material conspirator ; and not only so , but
that this instrument was delivered to him for the particular purpose
stated in the different overt acts : CROSSFIELD-1796-2,74.1165

what I wish to call the attention of the Court to is this ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,74.1166

Upton then appears upon the face of the charge to be a person whose name
, whose character , whose mind , whose demeanour , whose intention ,
with regard to these parties , is necessarily implicated ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,74.1167

and therefore I think it follows , as a necessary consequence , that
when a witness is brought by the prosecution from whom the Counsel for
the prisoner imagine they can derive intelligence with regard to Upton's
animosity , and the nature of his mind , they are entitled to give such
colour and such appearance to the character of that person , who
evidently is a principal actor according to the evidence before the
Court ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,74.1168

for your Lordship observes , in every step that has been taken ,
throughout all the perigrination in the different streets to the
different brass founders - that throughout the whole Upton has been the
foremost man ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,74.1169

and therefore I contend , that , as the whole seems to have issued from
Upton , as Upton is named upon the record , your Lordships and the Jury
have to try his conduct and his character : CROSSFIELD-1796-2,74.1170

but , above all , I contend that that which my learned friend is
examining too , namely , the animosity of Upton , is a fit subject for
examination ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,74.1171

and , whatever makes out that animosity , which shews that any of the
persons charged with this conspiracy could not conspire with Upton , on
account of the animosity in which they lived , is <font> prima facie
<$$font> ground for our examination ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,74.1172

we do mean , if we are under the necessity of going into our care , to
give your Lordship such evidence in chief ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,74.1173

but at present , if the Crown bring a witness from whom we imagine we
can prove that fact , all we claim of the Court is , to be allowed to do
it now . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,74.1174

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> Perhaps it would exclude all objection if
I were to state the exact object of the question I was proposing :
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,74.1175

- it is , to prove an attempt of Upton to suborn Hill to swear , before
<P_75> the Privy Council , that Le Maitre was the person who called upon
him with Palmer when he received the order for these models .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1176

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> I rise for the purpose of
stating to your Lordship , that I do not feel any anxiety with respect
to what the Court may think proper to direct upon this subject .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1177

It was in consequence of an intimation given by me , that your Lordship
had the trouble of hearing any discussion upon it ; because , when Mr.
Gurney was putting a question respecting a declaration of Upton's in the
absence of the prisoner , I thought it my duty to intimate to him that I
had cautiously and studiously abstained from asking any question , with
respect to any declaration or act of Upton , where I have not evidence
to offer that the prisoner was one of the persons present
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1178

I have no objection to its being taken in any way Mr. Gurney chooses to
state , that Upton had as much animosity as possible against Higgins ,
Le Maitre , and others ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1179

what I state is this , that the declarations of Upton never can be
evidence in a case of this sort , unless we , on the other hand , had
given some evidence of the declarations of Upton with respect to the
party now at the bar . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1180

Mr. Adam , says , that Upton is stated upon this record to have
conspired with these persons ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1181

that is not the fact : CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1182

we are to prove the conduct of the prisoner ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1183

having done that , it must be not by the declarations of Upton , but by
evidence , independent of these declarations , that the purpose and
intention of his mind must be proved to be such as is charged upon this
record . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1184

<font> Mr. Law . <$$font> There is no one charge of a conspiracy with
Upton through the whole of the indictment , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1185

nor is his name mentioned as a conspirator ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1186

we have not attempted to give any evidence of any acts of Upton but in
the presence of Palmer , and a third person , whom we have shewn to be
the prisoner : CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1187

if we had given evidence of declarations of his at a distinct and
detached time , it would have opened a door to this evidence .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1188

If it is fit to ask this , question ; we submit we should be at liberty
to go into declarations of the same man Upton .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,75.1189

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> It seems to me , that the very manner in
which <P_76> it may be insisted that this is a proper examination , goes
to demonstrate it can@ @not be proper in this stage of the cause :
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,76.1190

I am aware there is a stage of the cause , as has been hinted , when
this may by possibility become competent evidence :
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,76.1191

it is as it is opened , to shew the animosity of Upton ; and from whence
the learned gentlemen state that they mean to infer , first , that Upton
could not by any possibility or probability conspire with those with
whom he was in a state of constant animosity , and that probably he was
of course not conspiring with them but against them .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,76.1192

Now I could understand the application and the importance of this
argument , and the examination , {COM:amalgam} if the course the
Attorney_General had taken had been this , instead of charging and
laying before your Lordship the acts of the prisoner now at the bar ,
and his acts alone , or the acts of others when in his company and
presence , the Attorney_General had given in evidence either the acts of
Upton when alone , and when he might have been actuated by animosity
against any of these persons , or declarations of his when he might have
been actuated by the same animosity to repudiate all those acts of Upton
, to get rid of the impression of all these assertions and declarations
of Upton , so circumstanced , I could easily imagine the extreme
importance of shewing that Upton had declared he had set about doing
this with a view to injure others , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,76.1193

but it seems to me that that can by no means be evidence at present .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,76.1194

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> Your Lordship will favour me with a few
words in reply . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,76.1195

Your Lordship will observe what the nature of the question is that is
proposed to be put , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,76.1196

for it is only by referring to the particular question that your
Lordship can judge of the propriety or impropriety of putting it ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,76.1197

the question my learned friend proposes to put is this , whether in
point of fact Upton did , upon a certain day , and at a certain time ,
after the discovery of this supposed conspiracy - whether he did or did
not endeavour to get the witness at the bar to make a false accusation
against Le Maitre , one of the persons accused of this conspiracy .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,76.1198

Now your Lordship will observe , that that is a question which does not
go to Upton's general declarations - does not go to his general
demeanour - does not even go to establish an universal <P_77> prevailing
animosity in the mind of Upton , but it goes to establish this clear and
distinct point , that there existed in the mind of Upton either such an
animosity , or such a desire of self-preservation , that he was
determined to get a person to lay the whole blame upon , in order that
he might either escape harmless , or possibly that he might seek his
vengeance upon the person who had offended him , against whom he had an
animosity : CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1199

and I contend that , as this is an indictment for a conspiracy to take
away the life of the King , and as in that Upton is mentioned by name as
one of the persons employed to make this particular instrument , and as
he is brought forward as a particular character in this transaction , my
friend is entitled to defend the prisoner by an examination into the
attempts of Upton to suborn this man to perjury against one of the
persons indicted for this conspiracy . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1200

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> I doubt whether the fact , if
distinctly proved , that Upton had done any thing that marked animosity
, or that he had made such a declaration as this can , in any stage of
the cause , when one comes to consider it , be admitted ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1201

I will not pronounce a positive opinion upon that , because I do not
know exactly - what will be the course of the evidence , or what
ultimately we may think fit to receive , which may let in these
declarations . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1202

At present it is not receivable , because they are declarations not upon
oath - declarations not upon oath of a man dead , not under those
circumstances which place it upon the footing of an oath ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1203

and therefore whatever Upton may have said is not in its own nature
evidence , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1204

and consequently can@ @not be received , unless in one particular case ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1205

and that is where it is <font> argumentum ad bominem <$$font> by way of
taking off the credit of any thing the witness had said at another time
upon his oath , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1206

there it may be gone into , though not upon oath ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1207

for if a man is upon oath in one story , and makes a declaration before
or after of a different kind , this will take off from the credit of
that testimony ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1208

otherwise , in the nature of the thing , Upton's declaration is no
evidence at all . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1209

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> I now propose to call John Le Bretton .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,77.1210

<P_78>

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> I should be obliged to my friend to state
to what points he proposes to examine this witness .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1212

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> I call this witness to two facts , both
of which , as it appears to us , are of considerable importance ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1213

the first is to the time and manner of the sight of the prisoner , after
this accusation was made known against Upton ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1214

the next is , to his distinct declarations of the share of the guilt he
had in this transaction . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1215

<font> Mr. Adam <$$font> My friend has stated that the principal point
to which he means to call this witness , is to the declarations of the
prisoner with respect to his participation in the guilt of this
transaction . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1216

If my learned friend has any particular fact , that is a different
question , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1217

and I have no objections at all to his calling Le Bretton to prove that
fact ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1218

but if he means , after he has proved that particular fact , to go on to
examine Le Bretton to declarations of the prisoner , I then have to
submit to your Lordship , with great humility , but I think with great
confidence , that your Lordship , when you come to consider the
situation of this prosecution , will be of opinion , that there is no
ground whatever for admitting such evidence of declaration .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1219

- First of all permit me to state to the Court how I understand the
facts in this case to stand ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1220

secondly , permit me to state to the Court - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1221

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> I was going to submit to my friend's
judgment , whether it would not be more proper to wait till I had
exhausted that which my friend feels no objection to ; because it is not
impossible that in the first part of my examination of this witness I
may remove a part of my friend's objection . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1222

- I mean to shew the distinct fact of his flight .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1223

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> But you must first shew the
<font> corpus delicti . <$$font> CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1224

Does this man fly because he and two other persons went into a brass
founder's shop , or a turner's shop , and ordered instruments of a
particular description - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1225

what then ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1226

If there was an examination before the Privy Council - what then ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1227

What all this means at present I know nothing of ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1228

nor can the Jury know any thing of ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1229

you must first of all shew that in somebody this was an offence ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,78.1230

and you may , for aught I know , <P_79> shew it by the very medium of
the evidence which you propose to call , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1231

but then you must begin at the other end of it ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1232

there is a possibility that you might give a sense and a meaning to this
obscure and unintelligible evidence which we have had already , that may
connect and apply it to the particular charge ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1233

but at present I should say , we have heard a great deal about a
turner's shop , and a brass founder's shop , and it is all nothing .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1234

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> Your Lordship must be aware that the
Attorney_General would not have left this case as it is brought now .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1235

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> Certainly not .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1236

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> we are now going to give those facts the
solution which the Court is asking for . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1237

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> The only misfortune I labour under is ,
that the train of my thoughts has suffered some degree of interruption
from my learned friend ; not , I am sure , with any intention of that
sort , because I always experience kindness and civility from him .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1238

I will endeavour to recover the train in which I was proceeding as well
as I can . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1239

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> What are we about !
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1240

Mr. Adam do you mean to say that the prisoner's confession of his guilt
, if any such thing happened , is not to be given in evidence against
him , out of his own mouth ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1241

<font> Mr. Justice Grose . <$$font> What he has said perhaps is
respecting the purpose for which these things were ordered .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1242

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> Will your Lordship permit me to state the
grounds upon which I mean to address myself to your Lordship :
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1243

- I was endeavouring to draw your Lordship's attention to the nature of
the facts , and to the manner in which these facts were proved , and
then to ask your Lordship whether there was , according to the proof
that now lies before the Court , any evidence whatever , in a
prosecution for a crime of this sort , that could entitle my friends to
give in evidence these declarations , and these confessions ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1244

and I found my observation in the nature of this prosecution , and the
law of High Treason . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,79.1245

My friend , the Attorney_General , has stated , with great correctness ,
that there must be an overt act laid in the indictment ; that that overt
<P_80> act must be proved not by one witness but by two , unless there
are two overt acts of the same kind , and then one may be proved by one
, and another by another witness . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1246

What is the nature of the evidence already given ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1247

- Your Lordship has had given in evidence as I stated it before not with
a view of stating it in any way but in a way perfectly grave - a
perigrination of three persons from one brass founder's shop to another
, and then to a turner's shop ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1248

your Lordship has it in evidence , that where any thing was made , the
prisoner had no earthly connection with the order .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1249

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> He expressly assisted in directing the
model . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1250

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> The first witness called was Dowding ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1251

that witness did say he believed they all assented , but that Upton
alone spoke : CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1252

at that place nothing was done of any sort . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1253

They then went to a another brass founder's , where nothing was done .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1254

They then went to a third , where nothing was done .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1255

Then , afterwards , they came to the turner's , where there were
directions given to make a particular thing , in a particular form . ,
in wood . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1256

- Now , what I contend before your Lordship is this , that to that fact
there is but one witness - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1257

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> To what fact ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1258

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> To the fact of making that model which lies
upon the table , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1259

and the only witness to that fact is the last witness who was examined ;
because your Lordship will observe , that whatever opinion your Lordship
may have of Mr. Palmer's evidence , he has not spoken positively to any
one part of the transaction ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1260

and it is perfectly certain , that whatever passed when Mr. Palmer was
there , was never carried into execution at all ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1261

and , therefore , as far as Mr. Palmer's evidence goes , he does not
advance one iota beyond the position in which the evidence stands with
regard to the brass founders , namely , an inchoate direction , but
which inchoate direction is not even proved specifically to be given by
the prisoner , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1262

and certainly there is nothing proved to have been executed in
consequence of that inchoate direction . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1263

Now what is the overt act , if there is any ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1264

- it is singly the making that model : CROSSFIELD-1796-2,80.1265

then the making that model , if it is an overt act sufficient to entitle
your Lordship to <P_81> admit the evidence of declaration and of
confession , upon the part of the prisoner , is an overt act proved
merely by one witness ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,81.1266

therefore , I contend upon that ground , according to the form of
proceeding in High Treason , that it is impossible for them , without
having established that overt act clearly and manifestly , by the
evidence of two witnesses , to found any thing that can advance one iota
in proof of the guilt of the prisoner ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,81.1267

and I state that confidently upon this ground , because if it were in
your Lordship's breast to admit the overt act to be proved by a single
witness , and afterwards to admit the declarations of the prisoner , to
give colour to the use of that instrument ; you , in point of fact ,
send to the Jury a question to try , with respect to Treason , where the
foundation , that is to say , that which establishes the <font> corpus
delecti , <$$font> is established by one witness only , and not by two ,
as the law requires . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,81.1268

- I contend , therefore , upon that ground , that if your Lordship is of
opinion with me , that I have stated that evidence correctly , that the
only overt act , if it be an overt act , is the making that model , that
that overt act is proved only by one witness ; and consequently ,
according to the rules of proceeding in High Treason , the Court have it
not in their power , and the Court ought not - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,81.1269

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> You are right , what they
ought not , they have it not in their power to do .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,81.1270

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> Hitherto I have argued upon the idea , that
there has been colour sufficient given to the nature of that model , the
only overt act proved , the only thing proved to be done ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,81.1271

for that is the meaning of an overt act , that tends to infer an attempt
to take away the life of the King ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,81.1272

your Lordship will consider whether any colour is given to it or not ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,81.1273

and then your Lordship will consider this , whether in point of fact if
your Lordship thinks there is no particular colour or complection given
to this , that takes it out of the situation of a common instrument ,
for a mere matter of mechanical curiosity . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,81.1274

You will admit confessional evidence in order to give that colour and
appearance to it ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,81.1275

I contend , that that which now lies before the Court , according to the
evidence which has been given about it , stands in a situation in its
nature perfectly <P_82> indifferent , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,82.1276

it may have been , for ought I know , meant for a very bad purpose ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,82.1277

it may have been meant for a very good purpose ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,82.1278

it may have been meant for a purpose perfectly indifferent ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,82.1279

most undoubtedly I am entitled to put all these suppositions ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,82.1280

- Now , I ask in a criminal case of this sort , with evidence in the
nature of confessional evidence , about which , I am sure , I will not
trouble your Lordship at any length in the present stage of this
business , because your Lordship is better aware of the nature of that
evidence than any thing , I can say , can make you aware of it - I say ,
whether your Lordship thinks , in a criminal proceeding of this sort ,
where the thing done is proved only as I have stated it , where it is
not proved to be done with any particular colour , whether your Lordship
is not bound to suppose , until colour is given to it , by some such
evidence as tends to prove an overt act , out of the mouth of witnesses
that have received it , or supposed to receive it from the mouth of the
prisoner , whether your Lordship thinks it right to admit it .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,82.1281

The nature of confessional evidence is this , that undoubtedly it is
good or bad , according to the situation and circumstances under which
it is given ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,82.1282

and if your Lordship permits confessional evidence to be given , does it
not amount to this , that your Lordship is allowing the words and
declarations of a prisoner , not to a particular fact , but to the
intent - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,82.1283

if the words and declaration of the prisoner are to be proved upon this
occasion , they do not go to prove an identical fact ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,82.1284

but they go to prove a particular intent , or a particular disposition
of the mind . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,82.1285

- Now to apply that again to the situation of this case , to the colour
that is given to the use to which that instrument was meant to apply , I
must then ask humbly , but most firmly , whether your Lordship thinks ,
that in this stage of the cause , without going further , it is possible
for my friends to give the confessional evidence of the declarations of
the prisoner in this case ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,82.1286

above all , I submit that this instrument produced , is the only overt
act proved , it is proved only by one witness , and consequently that
they do not stand in a situation to show the mind of the prisoner , till
they have established most clearly and indisputably this overt act ,
either by two witnesses , or till they shall <P_83> have given such
colour and complexion to it , as to entitle your Lordship to think
evidence of confession admissible , as confirmatory and corroboratory -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1287

Your Lordship knows the doctrine of evidence of confession ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1288

there was a time when it was merely treated as corroborative evidence ,
though of late it has been admitted . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1289

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> Whether there is any rule of
law , which requires that there should be a certain quantity of colour
of charge proved in evidence before the Court can receive the confession
of the prisoner ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1290

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> My Lord , I am about to cite an authority
which I conceive will furnish an answer to your Lordship's question ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1291

but I will first beg to state what evidence the Crown has offered in
support of this indictment . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1292

The Attorney_General has not yet stated the overt act , to which he
intends to apply his evidence ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1293

but , I suppose , the overt act intended to be supported by it is the
second , in which it is stated , that the prisoner , and others , did
employ and engage John Hill , to make two pieces of wood , to be used as
models for the making and forming certain parts of an instrument , to be
used for the traitorous purpose charged in the indictment .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1294

Now , of any concern which the prisoner may be said to have had in that
direction , I submit to your Lordship that we have the testimony but of
one witness ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1295

the identity of Crossfield , even as being present when these directions
were given , has been spoken to only by Palmer -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1296

Hill has not spoken to the identity of Crossfield , or any other person
whatever , but Upton , and Palmer . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1297

The authority I allude to is this , in Mr. Justice Foster's discourse
upon the subject of High Treason , page 241 , in the case of Francis
Willis - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1298

" The Counsel for the Crown called a witness to prove what the prisoner
had said to him touching the share he had in the Treason , he then stood
charged with . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1299

- The prisoner's Counsel objected to this sort of evidence ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1300

and insisted , that by this act no confession , except it be made in
open Court , shall be admitted in evidence ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,83.1301

- but the Judges present were very clear that such confession is
evidence admissible , proper to be left to a Jury , and will go <P_84>
in corroboration of other evidence to the overt acts , though it might
be still a disputable point , whether a confession out of Court , proved
by two witnesses , is of itself sufficient to convict -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1302

Upon this last point none of them , except Chief Baron Ward , delivered
any direct opinion , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1303

his words are A confession shall not supply the want of a witness ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1304

there shall be two witnesses to the Treason notwithstanding ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1305

but to say it shall not be given in evidence there is no ground for it .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1306

The Attorney_General admitted , that two witnesses are necessary besides
the confession - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1307

the Solicitor is more explicit , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1308

and saith , he <paren> the prisoner <$$paren> shall not be convicted on
a trial without two lawful witnesses , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1309

that is the thing provided for . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1310

It was to exclude a precedent that had been settled in Tong's case
<paren> the case already cited from Kelyng and Hale <$$paren>
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1311

but it was not designed to exclude all confessions .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1312

That was evidence at law , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1313

and always must be so . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1314

The design of the act was to exclude confessions from having the force
of a conviction unless it were in a Court of Record ; and to prevent a
confession proved by two witnesses from being a sufficient ground for a
conviction . " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1315

I submit that this is a direct and positive authority , that there must
be two witnesses to Treason , previous to the production of any
corroborative evidence . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1316

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> To put an end to this
objection , it will be sufficient to observe , that even upon the
reasoning of the Counsel for the prisoner , this evidence ought to be
admitted , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1317

for here are two witnesses , and more than two to the very overt act
that is now insisted upon , in the way in which the prisoner's own
Counsel put it ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1318

for unquestionably it being proved that these three persons were all
together at Hill's , and a model having been there made , and approved
of by one , at least , and they all present , it is a question for the
Jury , whether those who were present , and who did not express
particular marks of approbation , did or not concur in it ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1319

and if they did concur in it , there are three witnesses to the overt
act ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,84.1320

but if it were not so it may be a good objection to make , in a future
stage of the cause , that there is but one witness to any one overt act
of <P_85> High Treason , and that this confessional evidence , upon your
rule , will not supply the want of another witness ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,85.1321

that may possibly be . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,85.1322

but the use of the confessional evidence is at present to make the first
part of the evidence intelligible , which it is not , nor do I know it
ever will be ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,85.1323

but it may , perhaps , appear from these declarations of the prisoner ,
whether the prisoner's evidence can be rendered intelligible or not ,
out of the mouth of the prisoner - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,85.1324

the authority cited shews , that the prisoner's confession is to be
received in explanation , and corroboration of the evidence offered ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,85.1325

and it may be offered upon the ground of there being already two
witnesses to the overt act insisted upon ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,85.1326

but I am of opinion , that it might be offered if but one witness at
present had appeared , because another witness , after they have made
this evidence intelligible , may come and give other evidence of another
branch of the overt act ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,85.1327

there is no rule of law which says , that you shall establish the overt
act by the evidence of two witnesses first , before you shall hear any
confessional evidence , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,85.1328

and that is the only question in the cause . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,85.1329

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know the prisoner , Crossfield ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,85.1343

<font> Q. <$$font> How long before you sailed had you seen him ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,85.1345

<P_86>

<font> A. <$$font> He came on Board our ship about a week before we
sailed from Portsmouth . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1347

<font> Q. <$$font> Can you tell us at what time he did sail from
Portsmouth ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1348

I can@ @not say which . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1350

<font> Q. <$$font> In what character did he come on board ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1351

<font> A. <$$font> As surgeon . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1352

<font> Q. <$$font> By what name did he pass , from the time he came on
board at Portsmouth till you sailed ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1353

<font> A. <$$font> By the name of " the Doctor , " as is most commonly
used on board a Ship . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1354

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you understand that to be a description of his
profession as doctor ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1355

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1356

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you know his name at that time ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1357

<font> A. <$$font> I did not . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1358

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> Do you receive men in this
situation without having their name taken down ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1359

<font> A. <$$font> The Captain might have his name taken down ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1360

but I did not know his name . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1361

<font> Mr. Garrow , <$$font> You sailed on the 13th ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1362

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1363

<font> Q. <$$font> On the 15th you were taken by a French corvette
called the La Vengeance ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1364

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1365

<font> Q. <$$font> And were carried into Brest ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1366

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1367

<font> Q. <$$font> You arrived there on the 23d ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1368

<font> A. <$$font> We did , to the best of my knowledge .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1369

<font> Q. <$$font> Until after you were captured by the French corvette
, had you ever heard , from the prisoner , what his name was , or heard
him called by any description but " the Doctor ? "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1370

<font> A. <$$font> Not until we arrived at Brest .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1371

<font> Q. <$$font> What name did he then assume ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1372

<font> A. <$$font> He wrote his own name in the list that was to be
sent on shore , " Robert Thomas Crossfield . "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1373

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you shifted before you went into Brest ? .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1374

<font> A. <$$font> Part of us were taken into the Frenchman .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,86.1375

<P_87>

<font> Q. <$$font> Did the prisoner or you go in the first number that
went of the English ship into the French ship ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1377

<font> A. <$$font> The prisoner went in the first number .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1378

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect any expression of the prisoner ,
when he went over the ship's side ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1379

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; as he was going over the side , he wished me
and the chief-mate good-by , saying , " he was happy he was going to
France , he would sooner go there than to England . "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1380

<font> Q. <$$font> When you arrived at Brest , did you find the
prisoner there ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1381

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; on board the same corvette that had taken us .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1382

<font> Q. <$$font> After you had gone with your ship into Brest , were
you put on board the same ship with him ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1383

<font> A. <$$font> The Pomona was turned adrift ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1384

and we were taken into the same corvette as they were in ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1385

<font> Q. <$$font> By what name did he pass in France ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1386

<font> A. <$$font> His own name in the muster list .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1387

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you mustered frequently ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1388

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1389

<font> Q. <$$font> What was the conduct of the prisoner on board the
Pomona , before he was captured ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1390

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> If you mean to apply it to
this particular subject very well ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1391

but as to any other misconduct of any other kind -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1392

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> I mean to prove what was his conduct
before he was taken , and then to contrast it with his conduct on this
particular subject . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1393

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> But , I think , there ought
to be nothing given in evidence against the prisoner , that may operate
to his disadvantage , until you have fixed something upon him , to which
that has a relation - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1394

till then it is all prejudice , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1395

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> Then I must transpose the evidence .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1396

- After you had arrived at Brest , did you hear the prisoner make use of
any expressions , with respect to his Majesty the King of England ; or
as to any share he had had in any matter which related to his Majesty ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1397

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I did . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,87.1398

<P_88>

<font> Q. <$$font> Be so good as to {COM:missing_"to"} state very
deliberately what they were ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1400

<font> A. <$$font> I heard him say , he was one of those who invented
the gun , to <font> asignate <$$font> his Majesty - to shoot his Majesty
. CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1401

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you put any question in consequence of his
saying that ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1402

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I asked him what it was like ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1403

he told me , the arrow was to go through a kind of tube by the force of
inflammable air . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1404

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he describe the arrow ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1405

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; he described it like one of our harpoons ,
which we kill whales with . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1406

<font> Q. <$$font> The harpoon is a barbed instrument ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1407

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1408

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he explain the properties of the barbs of the
arrow , that was to be used for this purpose ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1409

<font> A. <$$font> I do not rightly recollect any further than that .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1410

<font> Q. <$$font> State any other expressions you heard from him
relative to the same subject , or relative to the King of England ,
during his imprisonment there ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1411

<font> A. <$$font> I do not rightly recollect ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1412

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he use those expressions , you have mentioned ,
once , or more than once ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1413

<font> A. <$$font> I heard him talk of the gun several times ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1414

<font> Q. <$$font> This was a conversation with yourself ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1415

<font> A. <$$font> Chiefly with myself . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1416

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect any songs that he sung ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1417

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> Does your Lordship think that is evidence ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1418

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> I mean to state that they were seditious
. CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1419

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> I think you had better
forbear that examination . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1420

<font> Mr. Garrow . <$$font> You told us you found him at Brest , by
the name of Crossfield - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1421

How long did you continue in prison at Brest , the prisoner passing by
the name of Crossfield ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1422

<font> A. <$$font> Till we came away , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1423

<font> Q. <$$font> In what manner were you to be brought from Brest to
this Country ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1424

<font> A. <$$font> By a cartel which came from the West_Indies .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,88.1425

<P_89>

<font> Q. <$$font> When the cartel was ready , and you were about to be
transferred into that , what name did the prisoner assume ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1427

<font> A. <$$font> The name of " H. Wilson . "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1428

<font> Q. <$$font> Who made out the muster list for the purpose of
transferring you from the French ship into the other ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1429

<font> A. <$$font> He was one himself . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1430

<font> Q. <$$font> Had he acted at all as muster master ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1431

<font> A. <$$font> Not at all , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1432

any Englishman used to write the names - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1433

he stood at the gang-way CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1434

and put the peoples names down , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1435

and he put down his own name " H. Wilson , " the first or second name .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1436

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you hear the persons called over according to
the list ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1437

<font> A. <$$font> We had not the muster list called over ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1438

I saw that wrote in it , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1439

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he embark in the cartel by the name of Wilson ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1440

<font> A. <$$font> He did . . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,89.1441

<font> Q. <$$font> The ship out of which Crossfield was taken was the

<font> A. <$$font> Crossfield came on board the ship I was in , I think
on the 2d or 3d of April , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,110.2076

it was the beginning of April . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,110.2077

<font> Q. <$$font> On board what ship did he come to see you ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,110.2078

: <font> A. <$$font> The Revolution Brig , Captain Yellowley .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,110.2079

<font> Q. <$$font> Did any thing pass between you at that time ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,110.2080

<font> A. <$$font> Captain Yellowley introduced him to me , as Mr.
Crossfield - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,110.2081

he said , " his name was not Crossfield , but Tom Paine " -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,110.2082

and laughed . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,110.2083

<font> Q. <$$font> What did you say to him , upon his saying that ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,110.2084

<P_111>

<font> A. <$$font> I said nothing to him - CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2086

after he had been at supper he began to sing some very bad seditious
songs . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2087

<font> Q. <$$font> Did any thing afterwards pass relative to his
Majesty , the King of England ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2088

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2089

<font> Q. <$$font> What passed on that subject ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2090

<font> A. <$$font> He said " he shot at his Majesty , but unluckily
missed him , " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2091

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he say where ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2092

<font> A. <$$font> He said it was " between the Palace and
Buckingham-house . " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2093

I asked him sometime after , when he and I were walking the quarter-deck
- where was you when you shot at his Majesty ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2094

he hesitated sometime , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2095

and then said , between Buckingham-house and the Palace .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2096

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you continue the conversation with him upon this
subject ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2097

did you ask him any other question ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2098

<font> A. <$$font> No ; it was his constant subject every day after
dinner , and after supper ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2099

I dined and supped with him every day , sometimes on board one ship ,
sometimes another , for five months together .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2100

<font> Q. <$$font> Then , as you had a great many opportunities of
hearing this gentleman's declarations , did you ever hear him say any
thing more , relative to his Majesty ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2101

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2102

<font> Q. <$$font> In the general , in what way did he speak of him ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2103

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> I hope your Lordship does not think that
any thing with respect to this man's conversation , that does not go to
the point in question , is evidence ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2104

<font> Mr. Fielding . <$$font> Does your Lordship call upon me to
sustain the propriety of asking a witness questions of this nature -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2105

having established the ground immediately relative to the charge ,
surely I am at liberty now to prove the deportment of this man , and
what he has said , with respect to his Majesty , at any other time ,
subsequent to that substantive evidence , I have offered already ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2106

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> My learned friend has only asserted his
right , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2107

he has not argued it , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2108

and therefore , it would be idle in me to argue it .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,111.2109

<P_112>

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> If it is pressed after the
fact is established , I can@ @not say that general conversation
importing his sedition and enmity to the King , is not in corroboration
of the fact before stated ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2111

it is to be considered what effect even this declaration , now proved ,
will have ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2112

it is a declaration totally different from that which is proved by the
former witnesses , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2113

and has no relation , indeed ; to the particular charges in this
indictment . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2114

<font> Mr. Attorney_General , <$$font> I certainly shall not press it .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2115

<font> Mr. Fielding . <$$font> Did he say with what weapon he had shot
at his Majesty ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2116

<font> A. <$$font> No . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2117

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he give any description ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2118

<font> A. <$$font> He said , he had a thing , which I understood him he
had shot at him with , something as large as that candlestick , and as
long as the candle and candlestick together , which was like a pop-gun ,
round and hollow , about a foot and a half long ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2119

he said , " he intended to put some poisoned darts in it ; that he had
shot at a cat and killed her ; that the cat expired in a few minutes
afterwards in great agonies ; " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2120

he said , " it would kill any man at thirty yards distance , and nobody
could perceive that he had done it ; " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2121

this he repeated fifty times , while I was in his company .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2122

<font> Q. <$$font> When you were in company with him , were there other
people in company with him also ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2123

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , there were nine of us dined together every day
. CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2124

<font> Q. <$$font> Was this conversation before other people too ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2125

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2126

<font> Q. <$$font> And not confined to you ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2127

<font> A. <$$font> No ; except at certain times when he and I have been
walking the quarter-deck , and we have talked it over together ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2128

he shewed me in what manner they were made , with his finger in some wet
upon the table ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2129

he stroked with his finger as if there were hairs in it ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2130

he said , " they opened when it struck , and something flew out and let
the poison in . " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2131

<font> Q. <$$font> When the arrow penetrated , the poison came out ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2132

<font> A. <$$font> That as soon as the arrow struck , the poison came
out of the dart . " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,112.2133

<P_113>

<font> Q. <$$font> Had you any conservation about where he got the
poison ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2135

<font> A. <$$font> He said , " he prescribed it ; "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2136

but I do not know the place where it was bought ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2137

he said , " he was the very person that ordered it to be made up . "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2138

<font> Q. <$$font> What , do you mean the poison ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2139

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , " the poison to be mixed . "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2140

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he say what sort of poison it was ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2141

<font> A. <$$font> He said , " he got it at a shop . "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2142

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he say for what purpose he had got this poison ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2143

<font> A. <$$font> To fire at his Majesty . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2144

- He said , " he had fired at his Majesty ; " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2145

but he never said it was with that that he fired at him ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2146

he said , " he fired at him but unluckily missed him ; "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2147

I heard him say that fifty times ; that , " he damn'd unluckily missed
him ; " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2148

sometimes he said , " it was very unlucky . "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2149

<font> Q. <$$font> Was this description likewise given by him to the
people who were present , when he dined with you , or was in company
with you ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2150

<font> A. <$$font> There was nobody in the cabin with me when he made
that remark ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2151

the Captain and some of them were gone onboard the French Commodore ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2152

and some were on board the other ships ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2153

he and I were sitting at the table drinking some grog .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2154

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you , during those five months , ask him any
further explanation of those things or not ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2155

<font> A. <$$font> No , I never did , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2156

I was afraid to do it ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2157

I only asked him one question when we were walking the quarter-deck
together , where he was when he shot at the King ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2158

he said , " he was between Buckingham-house and St. James's ; "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2159

after he had hesitated some time , he said , " I was between
Buckingham-house and St. James's Palace . " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2160

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember having any conversation with him in
August ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2161

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2162

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he say any thing about his wishes , relative to
the people in London , and his Majesty ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,113.2163

<font> A. <$$font> He said , " he hoped he should live to see the day
when the <P_114> streets of London should be up to his ancles in the
blood of the King and his party , " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2164

<font> Q. <$$font> Was this said in the presence of more persons than
yourself ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2165

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2166

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect the names of any gentlemen who were
present when he made this declaration ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2167

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2168

I recollect one gentleman said , God forbid matters may be done more
easily . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2169

<font> Q. <$$font> Who was that ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2170

<font> A. <$$font> Captain Yellowley ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2171

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect any other persons , by name , that
were present ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2172

<font> A. <$$font> No , none else . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2173

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he say any thing about the chemist from whom the
poison was purchased ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2174

<font> A. <$$font> He said , " he went to the chemist's and ordered how
the poison should be made up , and it was made up ; that he made use of
some , and shot at a cat , and the cat expired in a very short time , or
in a few minutes afterwards . " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2175

- I believe I made a mistake in saying it was in August ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2176

it was some time in July , I believe , that he made use of that
expression about his Majesty . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2177

<font> Q. <$$font> When this conversation had continued between you of
his having shot at his Majesty , did he say any thing of what became of
himself , or what he was obliged to do ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2178

<font> A. <$$font> He said , " he was obliged to make off immediately
to Portsmouth , where he went on board a South_Sea-man , that in two or
three days afterwards they fell in with a French frigate , and luckily
were carried into Brest , " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2179

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he say any thing about a pursuit being made
after him by a King's Messenger ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2180

<font> A. <$$font> He said , " there were two King's Messengers after
him - that he was pursued by two King's Messengers , "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2181

<font> Q. <$$font> When you first knew him at Brest , by what name did
he pass ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,114.2182

<P_115>

<font> A. <$$font> By the name of Crossfield only .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2184

At the time he introduced himself as Tom Paine ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2185

he said , he went by the name of Tom Paine on board some other ships ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2186

- When he was given in to the list to come home in the cartel , he
entered his name as " Henry Wilson . " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2187

<font> Q. <$$font> You have said there were several people in company
with you at different times ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2188

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2189

<font> Q. <$$font> Endeavour to recollect all the conversation that
passed when he said he wished to see the streets of London flowing with
blood ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2190

<font> A. <$$font> That was his constant conversation all that night ,
till Captain Yellowley interrupted him , and said , God forbid , matters
may be done more easily . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2191

<font> Q. <$$font> Was there any person else , in your company with
Crossfield , that said any thing which drew an answer from Crossfield ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2192

<font> A. <$$font> No ; Captain Collins , another time said , he should
be happy if he could have the cutting off of the King , Pitt , and
Parliament CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2193

<font> Q. <$$font> Who said so ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2194

<font> A. <$$font> Captain Collins said , he should be happy to have
the cutting off the head of both the King , Pitt , and the Parliament .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2195

<font> Q. <$$font> What did Crossfield say , in answer to that ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2196

<font> A. <$$font> He said , " have patience , have patience ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2197

I hope to have the cutting off some of them by_and_by myself . "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2198

- Captain Collins said , he wished to have the cutting off both King ,
Pitt , and Parliament@ @'s head . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2199

- Crossfield said , have patience , have patience ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2200

I hope to have the cutting off of some of them by_and_by myself .

<font> Q. <$$font> When did you leave Brest ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2202

<font> A. <$$font> On the 27th of August . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2203

<font> Q. <$$font> In what cartel did you come ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2204

<font> A. <$$font> I came along with Captain Yellowley , in the
Revolution . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2205

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know how Crossfield came over ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2206

<font> A. <$$font> He came in the same ship .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2207

<font> Q. <$$font> How long was he embarked on board that ship before
you sailed from Brest ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2208

<font> A. <$$font> He was not long on board ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2209

I was on board the French Commodore with him ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2210

he , and Captain Yellowley , went on board the French Commodore half an
hour , or an hour before we sailed , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2211

when Crossfield and Yellowley came out from the cabin , Crossfield said
, " every thing now is settled to my own satisfaction : "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2212

that was said upon the gang-way of the French Commodore .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2213

<font> Q. <$$font> What became of him after this declaration ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2214

<font> A. <$$font> One of the Captains , that was in the boat , held up
his hand to stop him from saying any more . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2215

<font> Q. <$$font> What Captain do you mean ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2216

<font> A. <$$font> One of the masters of the vessel , Captain Wyatt ,
or Captain Lambton , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2217

I can@ @not say which ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2218

he further said , at other times , that " the French had given him great
encouragement , that they would provide for him ; "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2219

he said that fifty times , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2220

but he never explained more than that . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2221

<font> Q. <$$font> What became of him afterwards ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2222

<font> A. <$$font> Then he went on board the cartel ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2223

and we sailed that very day . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2224

the very day he left the French Commodore ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2232

place for a Justice_of_the_Peace , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2238

the landlord told me there was a Justice at two or three miles distant ,
and he would go with me himself . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,115.2239

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you go to this Justice_of_the_Peace ?

I was not ashore five minutes before I went to the Justice's ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,117.2243

when we came to his house he was not at home ;

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you never mentioned their names before ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2292

<font> A. <$$font> Not to any Justice , only to the gentleman at
Mevagissy , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2293

I mentioned them all to him . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2294

<font> Q. <$$font> When you mentioned all of those persons to the

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you tell him that they were the persons with
whom Crossfield and you had been in company ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2297

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2298

I did not mention them as if they had been of a party .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2299

<font> Q. <$$font> I do not want you to accuse those gentlemen ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2300

I only want to know whether you told the Justice that all those
gentlemen , you have mentioned , were constantly in your , and in
Crossfield's society , at this time ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2301

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; all of them excepting Captain Alexander ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2302

and he remained there . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2303

<font> Q. <$$font> Those Mr. Byrons were very respectable men , were
they not ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2304

<font> A. <$$font> They seemed very well there .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2305

<font> Q. <$$font> They lived in the mess with you ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2306

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,118.2307

<P_119>

<font> Q. <$$font> Perhaps you thought nobody so respectable as
yourself . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2309

- These people all came over with you , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2310

and the Magistrate , in Cornwall , to whom you discovered this whole
business , knew perfectly well that they had all come with you , and had
all been in the society , in which those things you have mentioned had
passed ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2311

<font> A. <$$font> They did not remain in the vessel an hour after .

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember Captain Clarke ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2317

<font> A. <$$font> I remember there was such a name ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2318

but I was not acquainted with him . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2319

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you never go on board the Peggy ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2320

<font> A. <$$font> No . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2321

<font> Q. <$$font> You say , when you were first introduced to Mr.
Crossfield , that he called himself Tom Paine ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2322

had you lived enough with Mr. Crossfield , at that time , to know his
manner of life ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2323

<font> A. <$$font> No . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2324

<font> Q. <$$font> Afterwards you came to know pretty well how he lived
? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2325

<font> A. <$$font> When he came to sing those songs I withdrew
immediately , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2326

and went on board my own ship . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2327

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you enough acquainted with him to know that he
accustomed himself to strong liquors ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2328

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , when he could get it ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2329

but he could not get it there , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2330

he would drink it if he could get it . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2331

<font> Q. <$$font> How long was it from the time you first became
acquainted with Mr. Crossfield till you came away ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2332

<font> A. <$$font> About five months . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2333

<font> Q. <$$font> And he lived in intimacy with you , and those other
gentlemen , all the time ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2334

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; he dined and supped with those gentlemen every
night , unless they happened to be on board the Commodore , or on shore
. CROSSFIELD-1796-2,119.2335

<P_120>

<font> Q. <$$font> Consequently all those gentlemen lived with him too
, all those five months ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2337

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2338

<font> Q. <$$font> Therefore every single thing you know they must have
known , excepting the private question you asked him , where he shot at
the King ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2339

<font> A. <$$font> They must have known the main part ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2340

there was nobody in the cabin but me when he told me about the shooting
at the cat with a dart . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2341

- There was a little of the grog dropped on the table ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2342

he marked with his finger , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2343

and shewed me in what manner he made it . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2344

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember any thing about the story of a hare
, CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2345

perhaps you may think it odd you should be asked that question ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2346

<font> A. <$$font> No . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2347

<font> Q. <$$font> You do not remember any thing of a story that used
to entertain the company very much , about a hare jumping into your lap
? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2348

<font> A. <$$font> No , only into my arm . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2349

<font> Q. <$$font> What was that story ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2350

<font> A. <$$font> I was coming though Uplime to Lime , in my way from
Axminster , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2351

just as I got to a wall , I stopped to make water ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2352

as I was buttoning up the fall of my breeches , a hare came through my
arm , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2353

I catched him by the leg CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2354

and turned him round , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2355

it was about twelve o'clock at night , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2356

I threw him in over the gate in among a parcel of dogs ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2357

and he remained there that night , and the next day ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2358

just as the parson was going away to church , the hare got out ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2359

and the dogs followed it all through Lime , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2360

there they catched the hare CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2361

and it was carried up . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2362

<font> Q. <$$font> Then you threw the hare over the wall among the dogs
? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2363

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2364

<font> Q. <$$font> How long did the hare remain among the dogs ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2365

<font> A. <$$font> Till after dinner . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2366

<font> Q. <$$font> This was a story that used to amuse the company very
much ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,120.2367

<P_121>

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; I have told it oftentimes .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2369

<font> Q. <$$font> What did you take this hare to be ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2370

<font> A. <$$font> I could find nothing of him till after I was going
to church ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2371

I was just got as far as the shambles when I heard the dogs out in full
cry after the hare . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2372

<font> Q. <$$font> After she had lodged very comfortably among them for
many hours ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2373

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; after the bones had been carried out to the
dogs , which , I suppose , drew the dogs out .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2374

<font> Q. <$$font> What did you tell those gentlemen you took this hare
to be ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2375

<font> A. <$$font> To be a hare . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2376

<font> Q. <$$font> How did you think this extraordinary hare could live
so long among the dogs without being destroyed ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2377

<font> A. <$$font> If you send to Lime , if any gentleman disputes my
veracity , there they will get a voucher for it .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2378

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> The gentleman asks you what
you took the hare for ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2379

I suppose he means to ask you whether you took her for a witch ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2380

<font> A. <$$font> They say the place is troubled ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2381

now I took it to be an old hare . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2382

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> Did not you use to tell those gentlemen ,
in the course of conversation , that you took this hare to be a witch ,
or the devil in the shape of a hare ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2383

<font> A. <$$font> No ; it was an old hare that had been hunted many
times by the dogs , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2384

and they never could catch him ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2385

if you want a voucher for it , if you send to Lime , you may get
vouchers . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2386

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> Where did you throw this hare
into ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2387

<font> A. <$$font> Over a place seven feet high , among a kennel of
hounds , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2388

and it was twelve o'clock at night . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2389

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> Were you ever sworn before a Jury before ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2390

<font> A. <$$font> I have been upon a Grand Jury twenty-five years .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2391

<font> Q. <$$font> I ask you , whether you were ever sworn as a witness
in a Court of Justice before ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2392

<font> A. <$$font> Many times . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2393

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> A Grand Jury ,
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2394

where ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2395

<font> A. <$$font> In St. John's , Newfoundland .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,121.2396

<P_122>

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> You raised a corps of troops in

<$$heading>

<font> Q. <$$font> You were Master at Arms of his Majesty's ship Active
? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2406

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2407

<font> Q. <$$font> You were taken prisoner , and carried into Brest ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2408

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2409

<font> Q. <$$font> What was the prison-ship you were on board of there
? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2410

<font> A. <$$font> The Elizabeth . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2411

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the prisoner Crossfield on board the same ship ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2412

<font> A. <$$font> I know the prisoner if I see him .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2413

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you see any body there whom you remember to have
seen on board the prison-ship ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2414

<font> A. <$$font> I know the man if he stands up , in a moment .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2415

<font> Mr. Abbot . <$$font> Go down , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2416

and walk round among the people , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2417

and look for him . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2418

<font> <paren> The witness pointed out the prisoner . <$$paren>
<$$font> CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2419

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember hearing him sing a song ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2420

- I do not ask what it was . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2421

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2422

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember having any conversation with him the
next morning , in consequence of having heard him sing that song ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2423

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2424

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you say any thing to him , upon that occasion ,
respecting the King of England ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2425

<font> A. <$$font> The song was - " damnation to the King ; "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2426

I asked him what King , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2427

he said - " The King of England . " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2428

<font> Q. <$$font> What observation did you make to him upon that ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2429

<font> A. <$$font> No more . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,122.2430

<P_123>

<font> Q. <$$font> What further did he say relating to the King of
England ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2432

<font> A. <$$font> He mentioned something in the song about Mr. Pitt .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2433

<font> Q. <$$font> But what did he say next morning further concerning
the King of England ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2434

<font> A. <$$font> I said , Doctor , you can never be a true Englishman
, to sing that song ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2435

he said - " he was one of the ringleaders of the three that attempted to
blow the dart at his Majesty in Covent Garden . "
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2436

- If Mr. Crossfield does not remember me , I will put on my jacket I
wore in the French prison with him . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2437

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he express any sorrow at being a prisoner in
France ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2438

<font> A. <$$font> No ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2439

he said - " Tom Paine's works were the best works " -
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2440

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> I submit to your Lordship , whether we are
to hear every part of this conversation ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2441

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> Having proved that the
prisoner said he was one of the three who attempted to blow the dart at
the King , in Covent Garden , I take it to be within the rule the Court
has already laid down , when a fact which does apply to the charge is
proved , that what goes so far to the same subject as to be
corroborative is evidence . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2442

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> My objection was , that the prisoner said
Tom Paine's works were the best works . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2443

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> That , standing alone , would
not be any thing , CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2444

you must hear the sentence throughout : CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2445

but you broke in just as something was coming that was material .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2446

<font> Mr. Adam . <$$font> Then , can Tom Paine's works be a subject
for the consideration of the Jury ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2447

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> Certainly not :
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2448

but if a man puts two things in one sentence , you must necessarily hear
both , and reject that which does not apply .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2449

<font> Mr. Abbot <$$font> What more did he say ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2450

<font> A. <$$font> He said - " Tom Paine's works were the best works he
could buy ; and that if ever he arrived in England he would attempt to
do the like again . " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2451

<font> Q. <$$font> When you returned to England in the cartel ship ,
did the prisoner return with you ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,123.2452

<P_124>

<font> A. <$$font> He did so . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2454

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he say any thing to you , on board that ship ,
as you returned home ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2455

<font> A. <$$font> Before he came out of Brest he mustered
{TEXT:mustured} me on board ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2456

I was close to the main-mast , on the Elizabeth's deck ;
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2457

and before we came in to Mevagissy , he said to me - " Young man , was
not you on board the Elizabeth ? " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2458

I told him I was ; " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2459

he desired I would take no notice of what was said on board of the
Elizabeth . " CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2460

<font> Q. <$$font> How come you to give evidence upon this occasion ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2461

<font> A. <$$font> For my King and Country .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2462

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you give information to any body of this ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2463

<font> A. <$$font> I gave information to a gentleman at Portsmouth ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2464

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you lay any information before any magistrate ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2465

<font> A. <$$font> I swore it before a magistrate .
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2466

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre . <$$font> How soon after you landed did
you mention this at Portsmouth ? CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2467

<font> A. <$$font> I mentioned it at Portsmouth to a gentleman on board
of the Royal William ; CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2468

he persuaded me to go to Mr. Greetham , the King's Solicitor there :
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2469

<font> Q. <$$font> On board what ship was he ?
CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2478

<font> A. <$$font> He came in March . CROSSFIELD-1796-2,124.2484

<P_125>

<font> Q. <$$font> Then it must have been in December , 1794 , not 1795
