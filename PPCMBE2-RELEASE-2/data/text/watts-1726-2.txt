SECT. I . WATTS-1726-2,1.5

<font> Of the Spheres or Globes of the Heaven and Earth . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,1.6

<$$heading>

There is nothing gives us a more easy or speedy Acquaintance with the
<font> Earth <$$font> or the <font> visible Heavens <$$font> than the
Representation of them on a <font> Globe <$$font> or <font> Sphere
<$$font> , because hereby we have the most natural Image of them set
before our Eyes . WATTS-1726-2,1.8

<P_2>

The <font> Terrestrial Globe <$$font> represents the Earth with its
several Lands , Seas , Rivers , Islands , <font> &c. <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,2.10

The <font> Celestial Sphere <$$font> or <font> Globe <$$font> represents
the Heavens and Stars . WATTS-1726-2,2.11

Several <font> Points <$$font> and <font> Circles <$$font> are either
marked or described on these <font> Spheres <$$font> or <font> Globes
<$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,2.12

or are represented by the Brass and Wooden Work about them , to exhibit
the <font> Places <$$font> and the <font> Motions <$$font> of the Sun ,
Moon or Stars , the <font> Situation <$$font> of the several Parts of
the Earth , together with the <font> Relation <$$font> of all these to
each other . WATTS-1726-2,2.13

The <font> Earthly Globe <$$font> , with the <font> Lines <$$font> and
<font> Signs <$$font> and <font> Points <$$font> that are usually marked
upon it , is sufficient to inform the Reader of almost every thing that
I shall mention here , even with Regard to the <font> Heavens <$$font> ,
the <font> Sun <$$font> and the <font> Planets ; <$$font> unless he has
a Mind to be particularly acquainted with the <font> fixed Stars
<$$font> , and the several Uses of them ; WATTS-1726-2,2.14

then indeed a <font> Celestial Globe <$$font> is most convenient to be
added to it . WATTS-1726-2,2.15

<font> Note <$$font> 1=st= , Half the Globe is called a <font>
Hemisphere <$$font> ; WATTS-1726-2,2.16

and thus the whole Globe or Sphere of the Heavens or of the Earth may be
represented on a Flat or Plane in <font> two Hemispheres <$$font> , as
in the common <font> Maps <$$font> of the Earth , or in <font> Draughts
<$$font> , or <font> Descriptions <$$font> of the Heavens and Stars .
WATTS-1726-2,2.17

<P_3>

Because <font> Globes <$$font> are not always at Hand , the several
<font> Points <$$font> or <font> Circles <$$font> together with their
Properties shall be so described in this Discourse , as to lead the
Reader into some imperfect Knowledge of these Things by a <font> Map
<$$font> of the World <paren> Which is nothing else but a <font>
Representation of the Globe of Earth and Waters on two Flat or plain
Surfaces <$$font> ; <$$paren> WATTS-1726-2,3.19

or at least I shall so express these Matters that a Map will assist him
to keep them in Remembrance if he has been first a little acquainted
with the Globe itself . WATTS-1726-2,3.20

<font> Note <$$font> 2=d= Though the latest and best Astronomers have
found that the <font> Sun <$$font> stands still in the Centre of our
World , and the <font> Earth <$$font> moves round its own Axis once in
twenty_four Hours With a <font> Circular Motion <$$font> , and round the
Sun once in a Year with a <font> Progressive Motion <$$font> ; yet to
make these things more easy and intelligible to those that are unskilful
, we shall here suppose the <font> Sun <$$font> to move round the <font>
Earth <$$font> both with a <font> daily <$$font> and <font> yearly
<$$font> Motion , as it appears to our Senses ; <paren> <font> viz.
<$$font> <$$paren> daily going round the Earth , and yet every Day
changing its Place a little in the Heavens , till in a Year's Time it
returns to the same Place again . WATTS-1726-2,3.21

SECT. II . WATTS-1726-2,4.24

<font> Of the Greater Circles . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,4.25

<$$heading>

The <font> Great Circles <$$font> are such as divide the Globe into two
equal Parts , WATTS-1726-2,4.27

and are these four , <paren> <font> viz. <$$font> <$$paren> the <font>
Horizon <$$font> , the <font> Meridian <$$font> , the <font> Equator
<$$font> , and the <font> Ecliptick . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,4.28

I. The <font> Horizon <$$font> is a broad flat Circle , or the Wooden
Frame in which the Globe stands . WATTS-1726-2,4.29

It divides the <font> Globe <$$font> into the upper and lower Halves or
<font> Hemispheres : <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,4.30

It determines the <font> Rising <$$font> or <font> Setting <$$font> of
Sun or Stars , WATTS-1726-2,4.31

and distinguishes <font> Day <$$font> and <font> Night . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,4.32

When the Sun is in the East Part of the <font> Horizon <$$font> , 't@
@is <font> Rising : <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,4.33

When in the West Part , 't@ @is <font> Setting . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,4.34

When 't@ @is above the <font> Horizon <$$font> , 't@ @is <font> Day
<$$font> : WATTS-1726-2,4.35

When below , 't@ @is <font> Night . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,4.36

Yet till the Sun be 18 Degrees below the <font> Horizon <$$font> it is
usually called <font> Twilight {TEXT:Twi-light} <$$font> , because the
Sun-Beams shooting upward are reflected down to us by the Atmosphere
after Sun-set or before Sun-rise . WATTS-1726-2,4.37

And 't@ @is upon this Account that in our Horizon at <font> London
<$$font> there is no perfect Night in the very middle of Summer for two
Months together , because the Sun is not 18 Degrees below the Horizon .
WATTS-1726-2,4.38

The <font> Horizon <$$font> is distinguished into the <font> Sensible
<$$font> and the <font> Rational . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,4.39

See <font> Fig. <$$font> I . WATTS-1726-2,4.40

<P_5>

The <font> Sensible Horizon <$$font> supposes the Spectator placed on
<font> s <$$font> the Surface of the Earth or Water , WATTS-1726-2,5.42

and it reaches as far as the Eye can see . WATTS-1726-2,5.43

But the <font> Rational <$$font> or <font> True Horizon <$$font>
supposes the Spectator placed in the Centre of the Earth <font> c
<$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,5.44

and thus divides the Globes both of the Heavens and the Earth into
Halves . WATTS-1726-2,5.45

Suppose in <font> Figure <$$font> I. the Circle <font> s d p e <$$font>
is the Earth , <font> u b n g <$$font> the Heavens , <font> b s g
<$$font> the Line making the Sensible Horizon , <font> hr <$$font> , the
Rational Horizon . WATTS-1726-2,5.46

The <font> Sensible Horizon <$$font> on the Earth or Sea is <font> a s o
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,5.47

and it includes but a very few Miles ; WATTS-1726-2,5.48

for if a Man of six Foot high stood upon a large Plain or the Surface of
the Water at <font> s <$$font> , he could not see further than three
Miles round . WATTS-1726-2,5.49

Thus it appears that the <font> Sensible Horizon <$$font> on the Earth
or Sea <font> a s o <$$font> differs very much from the <font> Real
<$$font> or <font> Rational Horizon d s e <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,5.50

But as to the Heavens the <font> Sensible Horizon b u g <$$font> scarce
differs at all from the <font> Rational <$$font> Horizon <font> h u r :
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,5.51

For the Eye placed in the Centre of the Earth <font> c <$$font> , or on
the Surface of it <font> s <$$font> , would find no evident Difference
in the <font> Horizon <$$font> of the fixt Stars , because they are at
so immense a Distance , that in comparison thereof half the Diameter of
the Earth , that is <font> s c <$$font> or <font> g r <$$font> the <P_6>
Distance between the Surface and the Centre is as nothing .
WATTS-1726-2,6.52

It may not be improper to note in this Place , that suppose a <font>
Planet <$$font> to be at <font> g <$$font> , if the Eye of the Spectator
were on the surface of the Earth at <font> s <$$font> , he would behold
it as level with the <font> Horizon : <$$font> But if his Eye were at
the Centre of the Earth or <font> c <$$font> , he would behold it raised
several Degrees above the <font> Horizon <$$font> , even the Quantity of
the Angle <font> g c r <$$font> , or <paren> which is all one <$$paren>
<font> s g c . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,6.53

Now the Difference between the Place where a <font> Planet <$$font>
appears to a Spectator in the <font> Centre <$$font> of the Earth , or
to a Spectator on the <font> Surface <$$font> , is called the <font>
Parallax <$$font> of that Planet at that time ; WATTS-1726-2,6.54

and therefore the Difference between those two Places <font> g <$$font>
and <font> r <$$font> , or rather the Quantity of the Angle <font> g c r
<$$font> , or <font> s g c <$$font> , is called its <font> Horizontal
Parallax . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,6.55

And this is of great use to adjust the real Distances , and consequently
the real Magnitudes of the several Planets . WATTS-1726-2,6.56

II. The <font> Meridian <$$font> is a great Brazen Circle in which the
Globe moves ; WATTS-1726-2,6.57

it crosses the <font> Horizon <$$font> at right Angles ,
WATTS-1726-2,6.58

and divides the Globe into the <font> Eastern <$$font> and <font>
Western <$$font> Hemispheres . WATTS-1726-2,6.59

It shews when the Sun or Stars are just <font> North <$$font> or <font>
South <$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,6.60

and determines <font> Noon <$$font> or <font> Mid-night . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,6.61

When the Sun is on the Meridian , and above the Horizon to us in <font>
Great Britain <$$font> , <P_7> 't@ @is just in the <font> South <$$font>
, WATTS-1726-2,7.62

and 't@ @is <font> Noon . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,7.63

When it is on the Meridian and under the Horizon , 't@ @is just in the
<font> North <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,7.64

and 't@ @is <font> Midnight . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,7.65

<font> Note <$$font> , Whensoever we move on the Earth , whether <font>
East , West , North <$$font> or <font> South <$$font> , we change our
Horizon both <font> Sensible <$$font> and <font> Rational ; <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,7.66

for every Motion or Change of Place gives us a Hemisphere of Sky or
Heaven over our Head a little Distance from what it was ,
WATTS-1726-2,7.67

and we can see less or more of the Globe of the Earth on all Sides
around us . WATTS-1726-2,7.68

Whensoever we move to the <font> East <$$font> or <font> West <$$font>
we change our Meridian , but not so if we move to the <font> North
<$$font> or <font> South . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,7.69

Upon this Account the <font> Horizon <$$font> and <font> Meridian
<$$font> are called <font> Changeable Circles <$$font> ,
WATTS-1726-2,7.70

and the Globe is made movable within these Circles to represent this
Changeableness , whereby every Place on the Earth may be brought under
its proper Meridian , and be surrounded with its proper Horizon .
WATTS-1726-2,7.71

III. The <font> Equator <$$font> or <font> Equinoctial Line <$$font>
crosses the <font> Meridian <$$font> at right Angles , WATTS-1726-2,7.72

and divides the Globe into the <font> Northern <$$font> and <font>
Southern <$$font> Hemispheres ; WATTS-1726-2,7.73

and distinguishes the Sun's yearly Path into the <font> Summer <$$font>
and <font> Winter <$$font> Half-Years . WATTS-1726-2,7.74

This is sometimes eminently called <font> The Line <$$font> ,
WATTS-1726-2,7.75

and passing over it at Sea is called by Sailors <font> Crossing the Line
. <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,7.76

<P_8>

<font> Note <$$font> , The Sun , Moon and Stars with all the Frame of
the Heavens are supposed to be whirl'd round from East to West every
twenty_four Hours upon the Axis of the Equator , or which is all one in
their several Paths parallel to the Equator . WATTS-1726-2,8.78

This is called their <font> Diurnal <$$font> or <font> Daily Motion .
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,8.79

IV. The <font> Ecliptick Line <$$font> is the <font> Sun's Annual or
Yearly Path <$$font> , cutting the Equinoctial in two opposite Points
obliquely at the Angles of 23_1$$2 Degrees . WATTS-1726-2,8.80

On it are figured the Marks of the 12 Signs through which the Sun passes
, <paren> <font> viz. <$$font> <$$paren> <font> Aries <$$font> the Ram
{COM:symbol_for_aries} , <font> Taurus <$$font> the Bull
{COM:symbol_for_taurus} , <font> Gemini <$$font> the Twins
{COM:symbol_for_gemini} , <font> Cancer <$$font> the Crab
{COM:symbol_for_cancer} , <font> Leo <$$font> the Lion
{COM:symbol_for_leo} , <font> Virgo <$$font> the Virgin
{COM:symbol_for_virgo} , <font> Libra <$$font> the Balance
{COM:symbol_for_libra} , <font> Scorpio <$$font> the Scorpion
{COM:symbol_for_scorpio} , <font> Sagittarius <$$font> the Archer
{COM:symbol_for_sagittarius} , <font> Capricornus <$$font> the Sea-Goat
{COM:symbol_for_capricorn} , <font> Aquarius <$$font> the Waterer
{COM:symbol_for_aquarius} , <font> Pisces <$$font> the Fishes
{COM:symbol_for_pisces} . WATTS-1726-2,8.81

These Signs are certain <font> Constellations <$$font> or Numbers of
Stars which are reduced by the Fancy of Men for distinction {COM:sic}
Sake into the Form of twelve Animals , and for the Use of the <font>
English <$$font> Reader may be described thus . WATTS-1726-2,8.82

<font> The <$$font> Ram , <font> the <$$font> Bull , <font> the heavenly
<$$font> Twins , WATTS-1726-2,8.83

<font> And next the <$$font> Crab , <font> the <$$font> Lion <font>
Shines <$$font> , <font> The <$$font> Virgin , <font> and the <$$font>
Scales . WATTS-1726-2,8.84

<font> The <$$font> Scorpion , Archer , <font> and <$$font> Sea-Goat ,
<font> The <$$font> Man <font> that holds the <$$font> Water-pot ,
<font> And <$$font> Fish <font> with glittering <$$font> Tails .
WATTS-1726-2,8.85

<P_9>

Among these Signs <font> Aries , Taurus , Gemini , Cancer , Leo , Virgo
<$$font> , are called <font> Northern : <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,9.87

But <font> Libra , Scorpio , Sagittarius , Capricornus , Aquarius ,
Pisces <$$font> are <font> Southern . WATTS-1726-2,9.88

Capricorn , Aquarius , Pisces , Aries , Taurus , Gemini <$$font> are
<font> Ascending <$$font> Signs , because they stand in Succession
<font> Northward <$$font> or rising higher in our <font> European
Hemisphere : <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,9.89

But <font> Cancer , Leo , Virgo , Libra , Scorpio , Sagittarius <$$font>
are <font> Descending <$$font> Signs , WATTS-1726-2,9.90

for their Succession tends toward our Horizon , or rather toward the
<font> Southern <$$font> Hemisphere . WATTS-1726-2,9.91

Each of these <font> Signs <$$font> has 30 Degrees of the Ecliptick
allotted to it . WATTS-1726-2,9.92

The Sun or any Planet is said <font> to be in such a Sign <$$font> when
he is between our Eye and that Sign , or when he appears in that Part of
the Heavens where those Stars are of which the Sign is composed .
WATTS-1726-2,9.93

If it be enquired , How we can know the Place of the Sun among the Stars
, since all the Stars near it are lost in the Sun-Beams ? 'T@ @is
answered , that we can see plainly what <font> Constellation <$$font> or
what Stars are upon the Meridian at <font> Midnight <$$font> , and we
know the Stars which are exactly opposite to them , and these must be
upon the Meridian <paren> very nearly <$$paren> the same Day at <font>
Noon <$$font> ; and thereby we know that the Sun at Noon is in the midst
of them . So that when you have a Globe at hand on which the Stars are
delineated , <P_10> you find on what Degree of any Sign the Sun is in on
a given Day , and see the Stars around it . WATTS-1726-2,10.94

The Sun is reckoned to go thro' almost one Sign every <font> Month
<$$font> or 30 Days , and thus to finish the <font> Year <$$font> in 365
Days 5 Hours and 49 Minutes or near 6 Hours : So that it may be supposed
to move slowly as a Snail thro' almost one Degree of the <font>
Ecliptick <$$font> Line every Day <font> from the West to the East
<$$font> , while it is whirl'd round together with the whole Frame of
the Heavens <font> from East to West <$$font> in a Line parallel to the
<font> Equator <$$font> in the Time of 24 Hours . WATTS-1726-2,10.95

<font> Note <$$font> , we vulgarly call the <font> Sun's diurnal or
daily Path <$$font> a <font> Parallel <$$font> to the Equator , though
properly 't@ @is a <font> Spiral Line <$$font> , which the Sun is ever
making all the Year long , gaining one Degree on the Ecliptick daily .
WATTS-1726-2,10.96

From what has been said before , it appears that the <font> Equinoctial
<$$font> Line , or <font> Equator <$$font> it self , is the diurnal Path
of the Sun on the 10=th= of <font> March <$$font> and the 13=th= of
<font> September <$$font> which are the two opposite Points where the
<font> Ecliptick <$$font> or Yearly Path of the Sun cuts the <font>
Equator . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,10.97

And these two Days are called the <font> Equinoctial Days <$$font> ,
when the the Sun rises and sets at six a Clock all the World over where
it rises and sets at all that Day ; and the Day and Night are every
where of equal Length . WATTS-1726-2,10.98

<P_11>

It may not be improper in this Place to remark that those 5 Hours and 49
Minutes , which the <font> Sun's Annual Revolution <$$font> requires
above 365 Days , will in 4 Year's time amount to near a whole Day :
WATTS-1726-2,11.100

Therefore every fourth Year has 366 Days in it , WATTS-1726-2,11.101

and is called the <font> Leap-Year . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,11.102

It may be farther remarkt also , that the odd Minutes which in this
Account are wanting to make up a compleate Day of 24 Hours are accounted
for in the <font> New Style <$$font> by leaving out a whole Day once in
133 Years : WATTS-1726-2,11.103

And 't@ @is the neglect of accounting for these odd Minutes in the
<font> Old Style <$$font> above a_thousand Years backwards , that made
the Difference between the <font> Old Style <$$font> and the <font> New
<$$font> to be at present <font> Eleven Days . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,11.104

<font> Note <$$font> , The <font> Zodiack <$$font> is fancy'd as a broad
Belt spreading about 5 or 6 Degrees on each Side of the <font> Ecliptick
<$$font> , so wide as to contain most of those Stars that make up the 12
Constellations or Signs . WATTS-1726-2,11.105

<font> Note <$$font> , The <font> inner Edge of the wooden Horizon
<$$font> is divided into 360 Degrees , or 12 times 30 , allowing 30
Degrees to every Sign or Constellation , the Figures of which are
usually drawn there . WATTS-1726-2,11.106

The <font> next Circle <$$font> to these on the Horizon contains an
<font> Almanack <$$font> of the <font> Old Style <$$font> which begins
the Year 11 Days later ; WATTS-1726-2,11.107

and the <font> next Circle <$$font> is an Almanack of the <font> New
Style <$$font> <P_12> which is so much sooner ; WATTS-1726-2,12.108

and these shew in what Sign the Sun is , and in what Degree of that Sign
he is every Day in the Year , whether you count by the Old Style or the
New . WATTS-1726-2,12.109

<font> Note <$$font> , The brazen Meridian is also divided into 360
Degrees or 4 times 90 ; on one Side or Semicircle whereof the Numbers
usually begin to be counted from the Equator both ways toward the Poles
: WATTS-1726-2,12.110

On t'other Side they begin to be counted from the Poles both ways toward
the Equator for special Uses , as will afterward appear .
WATTS-1726-2,12.111

<font> Note <$$font> , The <font> Equator <$$font> and the <font>
Ecliptick <$$font> are called <font> Unchangeable Circles <$$font> ,
because wheresoever we go on the Earth these Circles are still the same
. WATTS-1726-2,12.112

<heading>

SECT. III . WATTS-1726-2,12.114

<font> Of the Lesser Circles . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,12.115

<$$heading>

The <font> Lesser Circles <$$font> divide the Globe into two unequal
Parts , WATTS-1726-2,12.117

and are these four , all parallel to the Equator , <paren> <font> viz.
<$$font> <$$paren> the two <font> Tropics <$$font> and the two <font>
Polar Circles . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,12.118

I. The <font> Tropic of Cancer <$$font> just touches the <font> North
<$$font> Part of the Ecliptick , WATTS-1726-2,12.119

and describes the Sun's Path for the longest Day in <P_13> <font> Summer
: <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,13.120

'T@ @is drawn at 23_1$$2 Degrees distance from the Equator toward the
<font> North . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,13.121

And 't@ @is called the <font> Tropic of Cancer <$$font> , because the
Sun enters into that Sign the 11=th= of <font> June <$$font> the longest
Day in the Year . WATTS-1726-2,13.122

II. The <font> Tropic of Capricorn <$$font> just touches the <font>
South <$$font> Part of the Ecliptick , WATTS-1726-2,13.123

and describes the Sun's Path for the shortest Day in the <font> Winter :
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,13.124

'T@ @is drawn at 23_1$$2 Degrees distance from the Equator toward the
<font> South . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,13.125

And 't@ @is called the <font> Tropic of Capricorn <$$font> because the
Sun enters into that Sign the 13=th= of <font> December <$$font> the
Shortest Day in the Year . WATTS-1726-2,13.126

<font> Note <$$font> , What I speak of the <font> shortest and longest
Days <$$font> , relates only to us who dwell on the <font> North
<$$font> Side of the Globe : WATTS-1726-2,13.127

Those who dwell on the <font> South <$$font> Side have their longest Day
when the Sun is in <font> Capricorn <$$font> , and their shortest in
<font> Cancer . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,13.128

III , & IV. The North and South <font> Polar Circles <$$font> are drawn
at 23_1$$2 Degrees of Distance from each Pole , or , which is all one ,
at 90 Degrees distance from the contrary Tropic ; because the
Inhabitants under the <font> Polar Circles <$$font> just lose the Sun
under the Horizon one whole Day at their <font> Midwinter <$$font> , or
when it is in the utmost Part of the contrary Side of the Ecliptick ;
WATTS-1726-2,13.129

or they keep it one whole Day or 24 Hours above their Horizon at their
<font> Midsummer <$$font> , or when it is in the nearest Part of their
Side of the Ecliptick . WATTS-1726-2,13.130

<P_14>

The North Polar Circle is called the <font> Arctick Circle <$$font> ,
WATTS-1726-2,14.132

and the South is the <font> Antarctic . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,14.133

Here I might mention the <font> Five Zones <$$font> by which the
Antients divided the Earth , WATTS-1726-2,14.134

for they are a sort of broad Circles : WATTS-1726-2,14.135

But perhaps these may be as well referr'd to the latter Part of this
Book . WATTS-1726-2,14.136

SECT. IV . WATTS-1726-2,14.138

<font> Of the Points . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,14.139

<$$heading>

The most remarkable <font> Points <$$font> in the Heavens are these
twelve or fourteen . WATTS-1726-2,14.141

I , II. The two <font> Poles <$$font> of the Earth or Heavens , <paren>
<font> viz. <$$font> <$$paren> the <font> North <$$font> and the <font>
South <$$font> , which are ever steadfast , and round which the Earth or
the Heavens are supposed to turn daily as the Globe does upon these Iron
Poles . WATTS-1726-2,14.142

These are also the <font> Poles of the Equator <$$font> ,
WATTS-1726-2,14.143

for they are at 90 Degrees distance from it . WATTS-1726-2,14.144

From one of these <font> Poles <$$font> to the other a supposed Line
runs through the Centre of the Globe of Earth and Heavens ,
WATTS-1726-2,14.145

and is called the <font> Axis <$$font> or <font> Axle <$$font> of the
World . WATTS-1726-2,14.146

III , IV. The <font> Zenith <$$font> , or Point just over our Head ,
and the <font> Nadir <$$font> or the Point just under our Feet , which
may be properly <P_15> called the two <font> Poles of the Horizon
<$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,15.147

for they are 90 Degrees distant from it every way . WATTS-1726-2,15.148

V , VI , VII , VIII , The four <font> Cardinal Points of East , West ,
North <$$font> and <font> South <$$font> are 4 Points in the Horizon ,
which divide it into 4 equal Parts . WATTS-1726-2,15.149

<font> Note <$$font> , For the Uses of Navigation or Sailing , each of
these Quarters of the Heavens , <font> East , West , North <$$font> and
<font> South <$$font> are Subdivided into eight Points , which are
called <font> Rhumbs <$$font> ; so that there are 32 <font> Rhumbs
<$$font> or Points in the whole , each containing 11_1$$4 Degrees .
WATTS-1726-2,15.150

These are described on the utmost Circle of the Wooden Horizon .
WATTS-1726-2,15.151

From the North towards the <font> East <$$font> these Points are named
<font> North and by East , North North-East , North-East and by the
North <$$font> , North-East ; <font> North-East and by East ,
East-North-East , East and by North <$$font> , East , <font> &c.
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,15.152

Then , from the <font> East <$$font> toward the <font> South <$$font> it
proceeds in the same manner . WATTS-1726-2,15.153

The whole Circle of 360 Degrees divided in this manner is called the
<font> Mariner's Compass <$$font> , by which they count from what Point
of the Heavens the Wind blows , and toward what Point of the Earth they
direct their Sailing , which they call <font> steering their Course .
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,15.154

See Figure 2 . WATTS-1726-2,15.155

IX , X. The <font> two Solsticial Points <$$font> are the beginning of
the Signs <font> Cancer <$$font> , and <font> Capricorn <$$font> in the
Ecliptick Line where the Ecliptick <P_16> just touches those two <font>
Tropics . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,16.156

These Points shew the Sun's Place the longest or shortest Days <paren>
<font> viz. <$$font> <$$paren> the 11=th= of <font> June <$$font> and
the 13=th= of <font> December . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,16.157

<font> Note <$$font> , These two Days are called the <font> Summer and
Winter Solstices <$$font> , because the Sun seems to stand still ,
<font> i.e. <$$font> to make the Days neither increase nor decrease
sensibly for 20 Days together . WATTS-1726-2,16.158

XI , XII. <font> Aries <$$font> and <font> Libra <$$font> , the <font>
two Equinoctial Points <$$font> , where the Ecliptick cuts the Equator :
WATTS-1726-2,16.159

When the Sun enters into these two Signs , the Days and Nights are equal
all over the World . WATTS-1726-2,16.160

It enters <font> Aries <$$font> in Spring the 10=th= of <font> March
<$$font> , which is called the <font> Vernal Equinox <$$font> , and
<font> Libra <$$font> in <font> Autumn <$$font> the 13=th= of <font>
September <$$font> , which is called the <font> Autumnal Equinox .
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,16.161

These four Points , <paren> <font> Viz <$$font> <$$paren> two
Equinoctial and two Solsticial , divide the <font> Ecliptick <$$font>
into the four <font> Quarters of the Year . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,16.162

Here let it be noted , that the twelve <font> Constellations <$$font> or
<font> Signs <$$font> in the Heavens obtained their Names about
two_thousand Years ago or more ; and at that Time the Stars that make up
<font> Aries <$$font> or the <font> Ram <$$font> were in the Place where
the Ecliptick ascending cuts the Equator ; WATTS-1726-2,16.163

but now the Constellation <font> Aries <$$font> is moved upward toward
the Place of <font> Cancer <$$font> near thirty Degrees ;
WATTS-1726-2,16.164

and so every Constellation is moved forward in the <P_17> Ecliptick from
the West toward the East near thirty Degrees : so that the Constellation
or Stars that make up the Sign <font> Pisces <$$font> are now in the
Place where <font> Aries <$$font> was , or where the Ecliptick cuts the
Equator in the Spring : WATTS-1726-2,17.165

And the Constellation <font> Virgo <$$font> is now where <font> Libra
<$$font> was , or where the Ecliptick cuts the Equator in Autumn .
WATTS-1726-2,17.166

So <font> Gemini <$$font> is in the Summer Solstice where <font> Cancer
<$$font> was ; and <font> Sagittarius <$$font> in the Winter Solstice
where <font> Capricorn <$$font> was : WATTS-1726-2,17.167

And by this means the Sun is got into the Equinoxes in <font> Pisces
<$$font> and <font> Virgo <$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,17.168

and is arrived at the Solstices in <font> Gemini <$$font> and <font>
Sagittarius . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,17.169

This is called the <font> Precession of the Equinox <$$font> , or by
some the <font> Retrocession of the Equinox <$$font> , which comes to
pass by some small variation of the Situation of the Axis of the Earth
with regard to the Axis of the Ecliptick , round which it moves by a
Conical Motion and advances 50 Seconds or almost a Minute of a Degree
every Year , which amounts to one whole Degree in 72 Years , and will
fulfil a compleat Revolution in 25920 Years . WATTS-1726-2,17.170

Yet we call these <font> Equinoctial <$$font> and <font> Solsticial
Points <$$font> and all the <font> Parts of the Ecliptick <$$font> by
the same Antient Names still in Astronomy , WATTS-1726-2,17.171

and mark them still with the same Characters <paren> <font> viz.
<$$font> <$$paren> {COM:symbol_for_aries} , {COM:symbol_for_taurus} ,
{COM:symbol_for_gemini} , {COM:symbol_for_cancer} , {COM:symbol_for_leo}
, <font> &c. <$$font> tho' <P_18> the <font> Constellations <$$font>
themselves seemed to be removed . WATTS-1726-2,18.172

XIII. XIV. Here it may not be improper in the last place to mention
the <font> Poles of the Ecliptick <$$font> which are two other Points
marked generally in the Celestial Globe . WATTS-1726-2,18.173

If there were an <font> Axis <$$font> thrust through the Centre of the
Globe just at right Angles with the Ecliptick , its Ends or Poles would
be found in the 2 <font> Polar Circles . <$$font> So that a quarter of
a Circle or 90 Degrees numbred directly or perpendicularly from the
Ecliptick Line shew the <font> Poles of the Ecliptick <$$font> , and fix
these two Points thro' which the <font> Polar Circles <$$font> are drawn
. WATTS-1726-2,18.174

'T@ @is usual also in Books of this kind to mention two great Circles
called <font> Colures <$$font> drawn sometimes on the Celestial Globe
through the Poles of the World , one of which cutting the Ecliptick in
the two Solsticial Points is called the <font> Solsticial Colure
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,18.175

the other cutting it in the Equinoctial Points is called the <font>
equinoctial Colure <$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,18.176

but they are not of much use for any common purposes or Practices that
relate to the Globe . WATTS-1726-2,18.177

I think it may not be amiss before we proceed farther to let the Learner
see a Representation of all the foregoing <font> Circles and Points
<$$font> on the Globe just as they stand in our <font> Horizon <$$font>
at <font> London <$$font> , and so far <P_19> as they can be represented
on a flat Surface ; and in strait Lines . WATTS-1726-2,19.178

Let the <font> North Pole <$$font> be raised above the North part of the
<font> Horizon <$$font> 51_1$$2 Degrees which are numbred on the brazen
<font> Meridian <$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,19.179

then let the Globe be placed at such a distance as to make the Convexity
insensible and the Eye of the Spectator be just level and opposite to
<font> c <$$font> , which represents the <font> East <$$font> Point of
the <font> Horizon ; <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,19.180

then the Globe and the Circles on it will appear nearly as represented
in Figure III . WATTS-1726-2,19.181

The large Circle divided by every 5 Degrees represents the <font>
Meridian <$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,19.182

the rest of the larger and the lesser Circles are there named , together
with the <font> North <$$font> and <font> South Poles . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,19.183

Z , the <font> Zenith <$$font> of <font> London <$$font> , N the <font>
Nadir <$$font> H the <font> South Point <$$font> of the Horizon , O the
<font> North Point <$$font> , C the <font> East <$$font> and <font> West
Points <$$font> S the <font> Summer Solstice <$$font> , W the <font>
Winter Solstice . a <$$font> the <font> Ecliptick's North Pole , e
<$$font> the <font> Ecliptick's South Pole . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,19.184

The two Equinoctial Points are represented by C , supposing one to be on
this Side , t'other on the opposite Side of the Globe .
WATTS-1726-2,19.185

If you would have the two <font> Colures <$$font> represented here , you
must suppose the Meridian to be the <font> Solsticial Colure <$$font> ,
and the Axis of the World to represent the <font> Equinoctial Colure .
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,19.186

<P_20>

<font> Note <$$font> , This Representation or Projection of the Sphere
in strait Lines is usually called the <font> Analemma . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,20.188

See how to project it or to erect this Scheme <font> Sect. <$$font> XX.

SECT. V . WATTS-1726-2,20.191

<font> Of Longitude and Latitude on the Earthly Globe , and of different
Climates . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,20.192

<$$heading>

The various parts of the Earth and Heavens bear various Relations both
to one another , and to these several Points and Circles .
WATTS-1726-2,20.194

<font> First <$$font> , The Earth shall be considered here .
WATTS-1726-2,20.195

Every part of the Earth is supposed to have a <font> Meridian <$$font>
Line passing over its <font> Zenith <$$font> from North to South through
the Poles of the World . WATTS-1726-2,20.196

'T@ @is called the <font> Meridian Line of that place <$$font> , because
the Sun is on it at Noon . WATTS-1726-2,20.197

That Meridian Line which passes through <font> Fero <$$font> one of the
<font> Canary-Islands <$$font> has been usually agreed upon by
Geographers as a <font> first Meridian <$$font> , from which the rest
are counted by the number of Degrees on the <font> Equator . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,20.198

Others have placed their <font> first Meridian <$$font> in <font>
Tenariff <$$font> another of the <font> Canary islands <$$font> , Which
is two Degrees more to the East , WATTS-1726-2,20.199

but <P_21> all this is matter of Choice and Custom , not of Necessity .
WATTS-1726-2,21.200

The <font> Longitude of a Place <$$font> is its <font> Distance from the
first Meridian toward the East measured by the Degrees upon the Equator
. <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,21.201

So the Longitude of <font> London <$$font> is about 20 Degrees ,
counting the first Meridian at <font> Fero . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,21.202

<font> Note <$$font> , in <font> English <$$font> Globes or Maps
sometimes the Longitude is computed from the <font> Meridian of London
<$$font> , in <font> French <$$font> Maps from <font> Paris , &c.
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,21.203

for it being purely arbitrary where to fix a <font> first Meridian
<$$font> , Mariners and Map-makers determine this according to their
Inclination . WATTS-1726-2,21.204

By the Meridian Circles on a Map or Globe the Eye is directed to the
true Longitude of any Place according to the Degrees marked on the
Equator : WATTS-1726-2,21.205

And upon this Account the Meridians are sometimes called <font> Lines of
Longitude . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,21.206

The <font> Latitude of a Place <$$font> is its <font> Distance from the
Equator toward the North or South Pole measured by the Degrees on the
Meridian . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,21.207

So the Latitude of <font> London <$$font> is 51 Degrees 32 Minutes ,
that is , about 51_1$$2 . WATTS-1726-2,21.208

A Place is said to have <font> North Latitude <$$font> or <font> South
Latitude <$$font> according as it lyes toward the North Pole or South
Pole in its distance from the Equator WATTS-1726-2,21.209

<font> So London <$$font> 51_1$$2 has Degrees of North Latitude .
WATTS-1726-2,21.210

<P_22>

The <font> Elevation of the Pole <$$font> in any particular Place is the
<font> Distance of the Pole above the Horizon of that Place measured by
the Degrees on the Meridian <$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,22.212

and is exactly equal to the <font> Latitude of that Place <$$font> :
WATTS-1726-2,22.213

For the <font> Pole <$$font> of the World or of the Equator is just so
far distant from the <font> Horizon <$$font> as the <font> Zenith
<$$font> of the Place <paren> which is the Pole of the Horizon <$$paren>
is distant from the <font> Equator . <$$font> For which Reason the
<font> Latitude of the Place <$$font> or the <font> Elevation of the
Pole <$$font> are used promiscuously for the same thing .
WATTS-1726-2,22.214

The truth of this Observation , <paren> <font> viz. <$$font> <$$paren>
that <font> the Latitude of the Place and the Poles , Elevation are
equal <$$font> , may be proved several Ways ; WATTS-1726-2,22.215

I@ @'ll mention but these two . WATTS-1726-2,22.216

See figure IV . WATTS-1726-2,22.217

Let H C O be the <font> Horizon <$$font> , Z the <font> Zenith <$$font>
, or the Point over <font> London <$$font> , E Z the <font> Latitude
<$$font> of <font> London <$$font> 51_1$$2 , P O the <font> Elevation
<$$font> of the North Pole above the Horizon . WATTS-1726-2,22.218

Now that E Z is equal to P O is proved thus . WATTS-1726-2,22.219

<font> Demonstration I . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,22.220

The Arch Z P added to E Z makes a Quadrant , WATTS-1726-2,22.221

<paren> for the <font> Pole <$$font> is always at 90 Degrees Distance
from the <font> Equator . <$$font> <$$paren> WATTS-1726-2,22.222

And the Arch Z P added to P O makes a Quadrant , WATTS-1726-2,22.223

<paren> for the <font> Zenith <$$font> is always at 90 Degrees Distance
from the <font> Horizon . <$$font> <$$paren> WATTS-1726-2,22.224

Now if the Arch Z P added either to E Z or to P O compleats a Quadrant ,
then E Z must be equal to P O . WATTS-1726-2,22.225

<P_23>

<font> Demonstration <$$font> II . WATTS-1726-2,23.227

The <font> Latitude <$$font> E Z must be the same with the <font> Poles
Elevation <$$font> P O : WATTS-1726-2,23.228

For the Complement of the Latitude , or the Height of the Equator above
the Horizon E H is equal to the Complement of the Poles Elevation P Z .
WATTS-1726-2,23.229

I prove it thus . WATTS-1726-2,23.230

The Equator and the Pole standing at right Angles as E C P , they
compleat a Quadrant , WATTS-1726-2,23.231

or include 90 Degrees : WATTS-1726-2,23.232

Then if you take the Quadrant E C P out of the Semicircle , there
remains P O the Elevated Pole , and E H the Complement of the Latitude ,
which complete another Quadrant . WATTS-1726-2,23.233

Now if the Complement of the Latitude added to the Elevation of the Pole
will make a Quadrant , then the Complement of the Latitude is equal to
the Complement of the Poles Elevation , WATTS-1726-2,23.234

and therefore the Latitude is equal to the Poles Elevation ;
WATTS-1726-2,23.235

for where the Complements of any two Arches are equal , the Arches
themselves must also be equal . WATTS-1726-2,23.236

<P_24>

As every Place is supposed to have its proper <font> Meridian <$$font>
or <font> Line of Longitude <$$font> , so every Place has its proper
<font> Line of Latitude <$$font> which is a parallel to the Equator .
WATTS-1726-2,24.238

By these Parallels the Eye is directed to the Degree of the <font>
Latitude of the Place <$$font> marked on the Meridian .
WATTS-1726-2,24.239

By the <font> Longitude <$$font> and <font> Latitude <$$font> being
given you may find where to fix any Place , or where to find it in any
Globe or Map : WATTS-1726-2,24.240

For where those two supposed Lines cross each other is the Place
enquired . WATTS-1726-2,24.241

So if you seek the Longitude from <font> Fero <$$font> 20 Degrees , and
the Latitude 51_1$$2 Degrees they will shew the Point where <font>
London <$$font> stands . WATTS-1726-2,24.242

The <font> Parallels of Latitude <$$font> drawn at such Distances from
each other nearer and nearer to the Poles as determine the Days and
Nights of the Inhabitants to be half an Hour longer or shorter , include
so many distinct <font> Climates <$$font> , which are proportionably
hotter or colder according to their Distance from the Equator . Though
it must be owned that we generally use the Word <font> Climate <$$font>
in a more indeterminate Sense , to signify a <font> Country lying nearer
or farther from the Equator <$$font> , and consequently <font> hotter or
colder <$$font> , without the precise Idea of its longest Day being just
half an Hour shorter or longer than in the next Country to it .
WATTS-1726-2,24.243

<P_25>

The <font> Latitude <$$font> is never counted beyond 90 Degrees ,
because that is the Distance from the <font> Equator <$$font> to the
<font> Pole : <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,25.245

The <font> Longitude <$$font> arises to any Number of Degrees under 360
, because it is counted all round the Globe . WATTS-1726-2,25.246

If you go never so far towards <font> East <$$font> or <font> West
<$$font> your <font> Latitude <$$font> is still the same ;
WATTS-1726-2,25.247

but <font> Longitude <$$font> alters . WATTS-1726-2,25.248

If toward <font> North <$$font> or <font> South <$$font> , your <font>
Longitude <$$font> is the same , WATTS-1726-2,25.249

but <font> Latitude <$$font> alters . WATTS-1726-2,25.250

The <font> Latitude of a Place <$$font> , or the <font> Elevation of the
Pole <$$font> above the Horizon of that Place , regards only the <font>
distance Northward , or Southward <$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,25.251

and is very easie to be determin'd by the Sun or Stars with certainty ,
as Sect. XX. Prob. VII , and IX. because , when they are upon the
<font> Meridian <$$font> they keep a regular and known distance from the
<font> Horizon <$$font> , as well as observe their certain , and regular
Distances from the <font> Equator <$$font> , and from the two <font>
Poles <$$font> , as shall be shewn hereafter : So that either by the Sun
or Stars <paren> when you travel Northward or Southward <$$paren> it may
be found precisely how much your <font> Latitude <$$font> alters .
WATTS-1726-2,25.252

But it is exceeding difficult to determine what is the <font> Longitude
of a Place <$$font> , or the Distance of any two Places from each other
<font> Eastward <$$font> or <font> Westward <$$font> by the Sun or Stars
, because they are always moving round from <font> East <$$font> to
<font> West . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,25.253

<P_26>

<font> The Longitude of a Place <$$font> is therefore usually found out
and determined by measuring the Distance on the Earth or Sea , from the
<font> West <$$font> toward the <font> East . <$$font>

SECT. VI . WATTS-1726-2,26.257

<font> Of Right Ascension , Declination , and Hour Circles . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,26.258

<$$heading>

Having considered what respect the <font> parts of the Earth <$$font>
bear to these artificial Lines on the Globe , we come <font> Secondly
<$$font> to survey the several Relations that the <font> parts of the
Heavens <$$font> , the Sun or the Stars , bear to these several
imaginary Points and artificial Lines or Circles . WATTS-1726-2,26.260

The <font> Right Ascension <$$font> of the Sun or any Star is its <font>
distance from that Meridian which passes thro' the point Aries , counted
toward the East , and measured on the Equator ; <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,26.261

't@ @is the same thing with <font> Longitude on the Earthly Globe .
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,26.262

The <font> Hour <$$font> of the Sun or any Star is reckoned also by the
Divisions of the Equator ; WATTS-1726-2,26.263

but the <font> Hour <$$font> differs from the <font> Right Ascension
<$$font> chiefly in this , <paren> viz. <$$paren> The <font> Right
Ascensions <$$font> is reckon'd from that Meridian which passes thro'
<font> Aries <$$font> ; WATTS-1726-2,26.264

the <font> Hour <$$font> is <P_27> reckon'd on the Earthly Globe from
that Meridian which passes thro' the <font> Town or City required
<$$font> ; WATTS-1726-2,27.265

or it is reckon'd on the heavenly Globe from that Meridian which passes
thro' the <font> Sun's Place <$$font> in the Ecliptick , and which ,
when it is brought to the brazen Meridian , represents <font> Noon
<$$font> that Day . WATTS-1726-2,27.266

There is also this difference . WATTS-1726-2,27.267

The <font> Right Ascension <$$font> is often computed by single Degrees
all round the Equator , WATTS-1726-2,27.268

and proceeds to 360 : WATTS-1726-2,27.269

the <font> Hour <$$font> is counted by every 15 Degrees from the
Meridian of Noon , or of Midnight , WATTS-1726-2,27.270

and proceeds in Number to 12 , WATTS-1726-2,27.271

and then begins again : Tho' sometimes the <font> Right Ascension
<$$font> is computed by <font> Hours <$$font> also instead of Degrees .
WATTS-1726-2,27.272

So the Sun's <font> Right Ascension <$$font> the 10=th= of <font> May
<$$font> is 59 Degrees , or as sometimes 't@ @is called 3 Hours and 56
Minutes . WATTS-1726-2,27.273

The same Lines which are called <font> Lines of Longitude <$$font> or
Meridians on the Earth are called <font> Hour Circles <$$font> on the
heavenly Globe , if they be drawn thro' the Poles of the World at every
15 Degrees on the Equator , WATTS-1726-2,27.274

for then they will divide the 360 parts of Degrees into 24 Hours .
WATTS-1726-2,27.275

<font> Note <$$font> , As 15 Degrees make <font> one Hour <$$font> , so
15 Minutes of a Degree make <font> one Minute in Time <$$font> , and one
whole Degree makes four <font> Minutes in Time <$$font> .

<P_28> Note , <font> Degrees <$$font> are marked sometimes with <paren>
=d= <$$paren> or with a small Circle <paren> =o= <$$paren> , <font>
Minutes of Degrees <$$font> with a dash <paren> ' <$$paren> , <font>
Seconds of Minutes <$$font> with a double dash <paren> " <$$paren> ,
<font> Hours <$$font> with <paren> =h= <$$paren> , <font> Minutes of
Hours <$$font> sometimes with <paren> =m= <$$paren> and sometimes a dash
: <font> Seconds <$$font> with a double dash . WATTS-1726-2,28.277

By these <font> Meridians <$$font> or <font> Hour-Lines <$$font>
crossing the Equator on the heavenly Globe , the Eye is directed to the
true <font> Hour <$$font> , or the Degree of <font> Right Ascension
<$$font> on the Equator , tho' the Sun or Star may be far from the
Equator . WATTS-1726-2,28.278

By these you may also compute on the Earthly Globe what Hour it is at
any Place in the World , by having the true Hour given at any other
Place , and by changing the degrees of their <font> Difference of
Longitude <$$font> into Hours . WATTS-1726-2,28.279

But since several <font> Questions <$$font> or <font> Problems <$$font>
that relate to the Hour , can@ @not be so commodiously resolved by these
<font> Meridians <$$font> or <font> Hour-Lines <$$font> , because every
Place on the Earth has its proper Meridian where the Sun is at 12 a
Clock , therefore there is a brass <font> Dial-plate <$$font> fixed at
the North-Pole in the Globe , whose 24 Hours would exactly answer the
24_Hour Circles which might be drawn on the Globe : WATTS-1726-2,28.280

Now the <font> Dial <$$font> being fixed , and the <font> Pointer
<$$font> being moveable , this answers all the Purposes of having an
infinite Number of Hour Circles drawn on the <P_29> Globe , and fitted
to every spot on the Heavens or the Earth . WATTS-1726-2,29.281

For the <font> Pointer <$$font> or <font> Index <$$font> may be set to
12 a Clock , when the Sun's true Place in the Heavens , or when any
Place on the Earth is brought to the Brass-Meridian ,
WATTS-1726-2,29.282

and thus the Globe moving round naturally , represents , and shews by
the Dial-plate the 24 Hours of any Day in the Year , or in any
particular Town or City . WATTS-1726-2,29.283

<font> Note , <$$font> The upper 12 a Clock is the Hour of <font> Noon
<$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,29.284

the lower 12 is the <font> Midnight <$$font> Hour , when the Globe is
fixed for any particular Latitude where there are Days and Nights .
WATTS-1726-2,29.285

The <font> Declination <$$font> of the Sun or Stars is their <font>
Distance from the Equator toward the North or South Pole , measured on
the Meridian <$$font> ; WATTS-1726-2,29.286

and 't@ @is the same thing with <font> Latitude on the Earthly Globe .
<$$font> WATTS-1726-2,29.287

<font> Note , <$$font> The Sun in the vernal and autumnal Equinoxes ,
and the Stars that are just on the Equator have no Declination .
WATTS-1726-2,29.288

<font> Parallels of Declination <$$font> are Lines parallel to the
Equator , the same as the <font> Parallels of Latitude <$$font> on the
Earthly Globe . WATTS-1726-2,29.289

In the Heavens they may be supposed to be drawn thro' each Degree of the
Meridian , and thus shew the Declination of all the Stars ;
WATTS-1726-2,29.290

or they may be drawn thro' every Degree of the <font> Ecliptick <$$font>
, and thus represent the <font> Sun's <P_30> Path <$$font> every Day in
the Year . WATTS-1726-2,30.291

These parallel Lines also would lead the Eye to the Degree of the Sun or
any particular Star@ @'s <font> Declination <$$font> marked on the
Meridian . WATTS-1726-2,30.292

The Declination is called <font> North <$$font> or <font> South
Declination <$$font> according as the Sun or Star lies Northward or
Southward from the Equator . WATTS-1726-2,30.293

Observe here , that as any <font> Place , Town <$$font> or <font> City
<$$font> on Earth is found and determin'd by the <font> Parallel of its
Latitude <$$font> crossing its <font> Line of Longitude <$$font> ; so
the proper <font> Place <$$font> of the <font> Sun <$$font> or <font>
Star <$$font> in the Heavens is found and determin'd by the Point where
its <font> Parallel of Declination <$$font> crosses its <font> Meridian
<$$font> or <font> Line of Right Ascension <$$font> ; which indeed are
but the self_same things on both the Globes , tho' Astronomers have
happen'd to give them different Names . WATTS-1726-2,30.294

<font> Note , <$$font> The Sun's <font> utmost Declination Northward
<$$font> in our Summer is but 23_1$$2 Degrees ; and 't@ @is just so much
<font> Southward <$$font> in our Winter ; WATTS-1726-2,30.295

for then he returns again . WATTS-1726-2,30.296

There the <font> Tropics <$$font> are placed which describe the <font>
Path of the Sun <$$font> when farthest from the Equator , at Midsummer ,
or Midwinter . WATTS-1726-2,30.297

These two Tropics are his <font> Parallels of Declination <$$font> on
the longest and shortest Day . WATTS-1726-2,30.298

While the Sun gains 90 Degrees on the <font> Ecliptick <$$font> ,
<paren> which is an oblique Circle <$$paren> in a quarter of a Year , it
gains but 23_1$$2 Degrees <P_31> of direct Distance from the <font>
Equator <$$font> measur'd on the <font> Meridian <$$font> ;
WATTS-1726-2,31.299

this appears evident on the Globe , WATTS-1726-2,31.300

and may be represented thus in Fig. V . WATTS-1726-2,31.301

Let the Semicircle {COM:symbol_for_aries} P {COM:symbol_for_libra} be
the Meridian of the Northern Hemisphere , The Line
{COM:symbol_for_aries} C {COM:symbol_for_libra} be the Equator , or the
Sun's Path at <font> Aries <$$font> and <font> Libra <$$font> , the Arch
{COM:symbol_for_aries} {COM:symbol_for_cancer} {COM:symbol_for_libra}
the Ecliptick , the Line T {COM:symbol_for_cancer} O the Summer Tropic ,
the Line <font> a e <$$font> the Sun's Path when it enters <font> Gemini
<$$font> and <font> Leo <$$font> , the Line <font> n s <$$font> the
Sun's Path when it enters <font> Taurus <$$font> and <font> Virgo
<$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,31.302

Then it will appear that in moving from {COM:symbol_for_aries} to
{COM:symbol_for_taurus} the Sun gains 30 Deg. in the <font> Ecliptick
<$$font> in 31 Days , and at the same time 12 Deg. of <font>
Declination , viz. <$$font> from {COM:symbol_for_aries} to <font> n
<$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,31.303

Then moving from {COM:symbol_for_taurus} to {COM:symbol_for_gemini} in
30 Days more it gains 30 Deg. on the <font> Ecliptick <$$font> , and
8_1$$4 Deg. of <font> Declination , viz. <$$font> from <font> n
<$$font> to <font> a <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,31.304

Then again from {COM:symbol_for_gemini} to {COM:symbol_for_cancer} in 31
Days more it gains 30 Deg. on the <font> Ecliptick <$$font> , and but
3_1$$4 Deg. of <font> Declination , viz. <$$font> from <font> a
<$$font> to T . WATTS-1726-2,31.305

I might also shew the same difference between its <font> Declination
<$$font> and its Motion on the <font> Ecliptick <$$font> in its Descent
from {COM:symbol_for_cancer} to {COM:symbol_for_leo} ,
{COM:symbol_for_virgo} , and {COM:symbol_for_libra} .
WATTS-1726-2,31.306

By drawing another Scheme of the same kind below the Line
{COM:symbol_for_aries} C {COM:symbol_for_libra} . we {TEXT:We} might
represent the Sun's Descent toward the Winter Solstice , and its return
again to the Spring ; and thereby shew the same differences between the
<font> Sun's Declination <$$font> and its <P_32> <font> Motion on the
Ecliptick <$$font> in the Winter half-year as the present Scheme shews
in the Summer half-year . WATTS-1726-2,32.307

Hereby it is evident how it comes to pass , that the <font> Sun's
Declination <$$font> alters near half a Degree every Day just about the
<font> Equinoxes <$$font> ; but it scarce alters so much in 10 or 12
Days on each side of the <font> Solstices : <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,32.308

And this shews the Reason why the Length of Days and Nights changes so
fast in <font> March <$$font> and <font> September , <$$font> and so
exceeding slowly in <font> June <$$font> and <font> December : <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,32.309

For according to the increase of the Sun's Declination , its Semidiurnal
Arc will be larger , WATTS-1726-2,32.310

and consequently it must be so much longer before it comes to its full
<font> Height <$$font> at Noon , WATTS-1726-2,32.311

and it stays so <font> much longer <$$font> above the <font> Horizon
<$$font> before it sets . WATTS-1726-2,32.312

Thus while the <font> Sun's Declination <$$font> increases or decreases
by slow degrees , the <font> Length of the Days <$$font> must increase
and decrease but very slowly ; WATTS-1726-2,32.313

and when the <font> Sun's Declination <$$font> increases and decreases
swiftly , so also must the <font> Length of the Days : <$$font> All
which are very naturally and easily represented by the Globe .

SECT. VII . WATTS-1726-2,33.317

<font> Of Longitude and Latitude on the Heavenly Globe , and of the
Nodes and Eclipses of the Planets . <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,33.318

<$$heading>

The <font> Longitude <$$font> of the Sun or any Star is its <font>
Distance from the Point Aries , measur'd on the Ecliptick <$$font> ;
tho' we do not so usually talk of the <font> Sun's Longitude <$$font> ,
because we call it <font> his Place in the Ecliptick <$$font> ,
reckoning it no farther backward than from the beginning of the Sign in
which he is . WATTS-1726-2,33.320

So the 24=th= Day of <font> June <$$font> , we say the Sun is in the
14=th= Deg. of <font> Cancer <$$font> , and not in the 104=th= Degree
of <font> Longitude <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,33.321

The <font> Latitude <$$font> of a Star or Planet is its <font> Distance
from the Ecliptick , measur'd by an Arch , drawn perpendicular to the
Ecliptick <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,33.322

The <font> Latitude <$$font> of a Star or Planet is called <font>
Northern <$$font> or <font> Southern <$$font> as it lies on the <font>
North <$$font> or <font> South <$$font> side of the Ecliptick .
WATTS-1726-2,33.323

The Sun has no <font> Latitude <$$font> , because it is always in the
<font> Ecliptick <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,33.324

This Relation of <font> Latitude <$$font> therefore chiefly concerns the
Planets and the Stars . WATTS-1726-2,33.325

The <font> fixt Stars <$$font> as well as the <font> Planets <$$font>
have their various <font> Longitudes <$$font> and <font> Latitudes
<$$font> ; WATTS-1726-2,33.326

and their particular <font> Place <$$font> in the Heavens may be
assign'd and determin'd thereby , as well <P_34> as by their <font>
Right Ascension <$$font> and <font> Declination <$$font> which I
mention'd before ; WATTS-1726-2,34.327

and <font> Astronomers <$$font> use this Method to fix exactly the
<font> Place <$$font> of a <font> Star <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,34.328

But I think it is easier for a Learner to find a <font> Star's Place
<$$font> by its <font> Declination <$$font> and <font> Right Ascension
<$$font> ; WATTS-1726-2,34.329

and the common Astronomical Problems seem to be solv'd more naturally
and easily by this Method . WATTS-1726-2,34.330

It may be here mentioned <paren> tho' 't@ @is before its proper place
<$$paren> that the several Planets , viz. <font> Saturn , Jupiter ,
Mars , Venus , Mercury , <$$font> and the <font> Moon <$$font> make
their Revolutions at very different Distances from the Earth , from the
Sun , and from one another , each having its distinct <font> Orbit
<$$font> or Path nearer or farther from us . WATTS-1726-2,34.331

And as each of their <font> Orbits <$$font> is at vastly different
Distances , so neither is it perfectly parallel to one another , nor to
the <font> Ecliptick <$$font> or yearly Path of the Sun .
WATTS-1726-2,34.332

Thence it follows that these Planets have some more , some less <font>
Latitude <$$font> , because <P_35> their Orbits or Paths differ some few
Degrees from the Sun's Path , and intersect or cross the <font>
Ecliptick <$$font> , at two opposite Points in certain small Angles of
two , three , four or five Degrees , which Points are called the <font>
Nodes <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,35.333

The <font> Node <$$font> where any Planet crosses the Ecliptick
ascending to the Northward is called the <font> Dragon's Head <$$font> ,
and marked thus {COM:symbol_for_dragon's_head} . WATTS-1726-2,35.334

Where the Planet crosses the Ecliptick descending to the Southward , 't@
@is call'd the <font> Dragon's Tail <$$font> , and marked thus
{COM:symbol_for_dragon's_tail} . WATTS-1726-2,35.335

'T@ @is very difficult to represent the <font> Latitudes of the Planets
<$$font> in their different Orbits upon a Globe , as well as upon a Flat
or plain Surface ; WATTS-1726-2,35.336

the best way that I know is , to take two small Hoops of different Sizes
, as in Fig. XI. and thrust a strait Wyre <font> c o <$$font> thro'
them both in the two opposite parts of their Circumference : Then turn
the innermost Hoop <paren> which may represent the <font> Path <$$font>
of the <font> Moon <$$font> <$$paren> so far aside or obliquely as to
make an Angle of 5_1$$4 Degrees with the utmost <paren> which represents
the <font> Sun's Path <$$font> <$$paren> . WATTS-1726-2,35.337

Thus the two Points <font> c <$$font> and <font> o <$$font> or
{COM:symbol_for_dragon's_head} and {COM:symbol_for_dragon's_tail} where
the Wire joins the Hoops , are the two <font> Nodes <$$font> or the
Points of Intersection . WATTS-1726-2,35.338

This Difference of <font> Orbits <$$font> of the Planets and their
<font> Intersections <$$font> of <font> Nodes <$$font> , may be
represented also by two circular pieces of Pastboard as in <font> Fig.
<$$font> XII . WATTS-1726-2,35.339

When the less <paren> whose <P_36> edge represents the Moon's Orbit
<$$paren> is put halfway thro' a slit A B , that is made in the Diameter
of the larger <paren> or the Sun's Orbit , <$$paren> and then brought up
near to a parallel or level with the larger within 5_1$$4 Degrees .
WATTS-1726-2,36.340

Thus the two <font> Nodes <$$font> will be represented by A and B .
WATTS-1726-2,36.341

If the <font> Moon's <$$font> Path and the <font> Sun's <$$font> were
precisely the same , or parallel Circles in the same Plane , then at
every <font> New Moon <$$font> the <font> Sun <$$font> would be eclipsed
by the Moon's coming between the Earth and the Sun : WATTS-1726-2,36.342

And at every <font> Full Moon <$$font> the <font> Moon <$$font> would be
eclipsed by the Earth's coming between the Sun and the Moon .
WATTS-1726-2,36.343

But since the Planes of their Orbits or Paths are different , and make
Angles with each other , there can@ @not be <font> Eclipses <$$font> but
in or near the place where the Planes of their Orbits or Paths intersect
or cross each other . WATTS-1726-2,36.344

In or very near these <font> Nodes <$$font> , therefore , is the only
place where the Earth or Moon can hide the Sun or any part of it from
each other , and cause an <font> Eclipse <$$font> either <font> total
<$$font> or <font> partial : <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,36.345

And for these Reasons the Orbit or Path of the Sun is called the <font>
Ecliptick <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,36.346

The Eclipses of other Planets , or of any part of the Sun by their
Interposure , are so very inconsiderable as deserve not our present
Notice . WATTS-1726-2,36.347

SECT. VIII . WATTS-1726-2,37.350

<font> Of Altitude , Azimuth , Amplitude , and various Risings and
Settings of the Sun and Stars . WATTS-1726-2,37.351

<$$heading>

The <font> Altitude <$$font> of the Sun or Star is its <font> Height
above the Horizon , measur'd by the Degrees on the Quadrant of Altitudes
<$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,37.353

As the Height of the Sun at Noon is called its <font> Meridian Altitude
<$$font> , or its <font> Culminating <$$font> , so the Height of the Sun
in the East or West is call'd its <font> Vertical Altitude <$$font> .
WATTS-1726-2,37.354

The <font> Quadrant of Altitudes <$$font> is a thin Label of Brass ,
fastened to the <font> Meridian <$$font> at the <font> Zenith <$$font>
of any Place , and bending down to the <font> Horizon <$$font> , divided
into 90 Deg. counting from the Horizon upward . WATTS-1726-2,37.355

<font> Circles parallel to the Horizon <$$font> , supposed to be drawn
round the Globe , thro' every Degree of the <font> Quadrant of Altitudes
<$$font> less and less , till they come to a Point in the Zenith
{COM:missing_comma} are called <font> Parallels of Altitude <$$font> ,
or sometimes in the old <font> Arabick <$$font> name , <font>
Almicantars <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,37.356

But these can never be actually drawn on the Globe , because the <font>
Horizon <$$font> and <font> Zenith <$$font> are infinitely variable ,
according to the different Latitudes of Places . WATTS-1726-2,37.357

<P_38>

<font> Note , <$$font> The Sun being always highest on the <font>
Meridian <$$font> , or at Noon , it descends in an Arch towards the
Horizon in order to <font> set <$$font> , by the same Degrees by which
it ascended from the Horizon after its <font> rising <$$font> .
WATTS-1726-2,38.359

Stars and Planets <font> rise <$$font> and <font> set <$$font> ,
WATTS-1726-2,38.360

and come to the <font> Meridian <$$font> at all different Hours of the
Day or Night according to the various Seasons of the Year , or the Signs
in which the Planets are . WATTS-1726-2,38.361

As the word <font> Altitude <$$font> is used to signifie the Height of
the Sun or Star above the Horizon , so the <font> Depression <$$font> of
the Sun or Star is its Distance from or below the Horizon .
WATTS-1726-2,38.362

The <font> Azimuth <$$font> of the Sun or Star is its Distance from any
of the <font> four Cardinal Points <$$font> , East , West , North and
South , <font> measur'd by the Degrees on the Horizon . <$$font>
WATTS-1726-2,38.363

<font> Note , <$$font> When we speak of the <font> Sun's Azimuth
<$$font> in general , we usually mean his <font> Distance from the South
: <$$font> WATTS-1726-2,38.364

But when his Distance from the North , East , or West is intended , we
say , his <font> Azimuth from the North <$$font> , the <font> East
<$$font> , or the <font> West <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,38.365

<font> Great Circles <$$font> cutting every Degree of the <font> Horizon
<$$font> at Right Angles , and meeting in the <font> Zenith <$$font> and
<font> Nadir <$$font> are call'd <font> Azimuthal <$$font> or <font>
Vertical Circles <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,38.366

They direct the Eye to the Point of the Sun or Star@ @'s <font> Azimuth
on the Horizon <$$font> , tho' the Sun or Star may be far above , or
below the Horizon . WATTS-1726-2,38.367

<P_39>

Note , <font> Vertical Circles <$$font> are the same with Regard to the
Zenith , Nadir , and the Horizon , as <font> Meridians or Hour <$$font>
Circles are with Regard to the two Poles of the World and the Equator .
WATTS-1726-2,39.369

But they can never be actually drawn on a Globe , because the <font>
Zenith <$$font> , <font> Nadir <$$font> , and <font> Horizon <$$font>
are ever variable . WATTS-1726-2,39.370

<font> Note <$$font> , The <font> Quadrant of Altitudes <$$font> being
moveable when one End of it is fastened at the Zenith , the graduated
Edge may be laid over the Place of the Sun or Star , and brought down to
the Horizon ; WATTS-1726-2,39.371

then it represents any <font> Azimuth <$$font> or <font> Vertical Circle
<$$font> , in which the Sun or Star is ; WATTS-1726-2,39.372

and thus it shews the Degree of its Azimuth on the Horizon .
WATTS-1726-2,39.373

<font> Note <$$font> , The Azimuth of the Sun or Star from the <font>
East <$$font> or <font> West <$$font> Points of the Horizon at its
rising or setting , is called its <font> Amplitude <$$font> .
WATTS-1726-2,39.374

<font> Note <$$font> , The Sun is always in the South at Noon , or 12 a
Clock , and in the North at <font> Midnight <$$font> , viz. in <font>
Europe <$$font> and all Places on this Side of the Equator .
WATTS-1726-2,39.375

But 't@ @is not at the East or West at <font> six <$$font> a Clock any
other Day in the Year besides the two Equinoctial Days , as will easily
appear in an <font> oblique Position of the Sphere <$$font> , <paren> of
which see the next Section <$$paren> and especially in the last Section
where the <font> Analemma <$$font> shall be more fully described .
WATTS-1726-2,39.376

<P_40>

Yet the Relation which the <font> Parallels of Altitude <$$font> bear to
the <font> Vertical Circles <$$font> , and which these <font> Vertical
<$$font> , or <font> Azimuthal <$$font> Circles bear to the <font>
Meridians <$$font> , or <font> Hour-Circles <$$font> may be represented
to the Eye in <font> Fig. <$$font> VI. and VII . WATTS-1726-2,40.378

In <font> Fig. <$$font> VI. Suppose the outermost Circle be the
Meridian , HR the Horizon , Z the Zenith , N the Nadir ;
WATTS-1726-2,40.379

then <font> d b , f g , k m <$$font> ; will be the <font> Parallels of
Altitude <$$font> and Z <font> a <$$font> N , Z <font> e <$$font> N , Z
<font> o <$$font> N , Z C N , will be <font> vertical Circles <$$font> ,
or Circles of <font> Azimuth <$$font> crossing each other at Right
Angles . WATTS-1726-2,40.380

Thus Z C N is the vertical Circle of East or West . WATTS-1726-2,40.381

And in this Scheme <font> f H <$$font> will be the Arc of the Altitude
of the Star <font> s <$$font> , WATTS-1726-2,40.382

and <font> H e <$$font> will be its <font> Azimuth <$$font> from the
Meridian ; WATTS-1726-2,40.383

and <font> C e <$$font> will be its Azimuth from the East or West .
WATTS-1726-2,40.384

But if the Line H R be supposed to represent the Equator , then <font> d
b , f g , &c. <$$font> will be <font> Parallels of Latitude <$$font> on
Earth , or <font> Parallels of Declination <$$font> in the Heavens .
WATTS-1726-2,40.385

Then also the Arches Z H N , Z a N , Z e N , Z o N , Z c N , will be
<font> Meridians <$$font> , or <font> Lines of Longitude <$$font> on
Earth , and <font> Hour Circles <$$font> in the Heavens .

then <P_41> Z H N , Z <font> a <$$font> N , Z <font> e <$$font> N , Z

<$$font> L , <font> &c. <$$font> will be <font> Hour Circles <$$font> .
WATTS-1726-2,41.389

And in this Position the Star <font> s <$$font> will have E <font> o
<$$font> for its Hour from Noon or the Meridian , WATTS-1726-2,41.390

but its Azimuth from Noon or the South or Meridian will be H <font> e
<$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,41.391

Or if you reckon its Azimuth from the East or West Vertical <paren>
which is Z <font> c <$$font> N <$$paren> it will be found to be C <font>
e <$$font> , while its Hour reckoned from P 6 CL <paren> which is the
Six a Clock Hour Line <$$paren> will be found to be 6 <font> s <$$font>
or C . WATTS-1726-2,41.392

Thus it will appear how the <font> Hour <$$font> of the Sun differs from
its <font> Azimuth <$$font> , and that both of them are number'd , or
counted from the Meridian P Z E H L N , WATTS-1726-2,41.393

yet they do not by any means keep equal Place with one another , one
being number'd along the <font> Equator <$$font> EQ , the other number'd
along the <font> Horizon <$$font> HR . WATTS-1726-2,41.394

Thus you see most evidently that if you suppose the Sun <font> s
<$$font> {COM:symbol_for_sun} to be in the <font> Tropic of Cancer
<$$font> represented by the Line T {COM:symbol_for_cancer} , the
difference between the <font> Hour <$$font> and <font> Azimuth <$$font>
will appear to be very great ; and that the Sun's <font> Azimuth
<$$font> from Noon H <font> e <$$font> increases a great deal faster
than his <font> Hour <$$font> T <font> s <$$font> doth in the middle of
Summer . WATTS-1726-2,41.395

And if another Line K {COM:symbol_for_capricorn} were drawn to represent
the <font> Tropic of Capricorn <$$font> , the Sun's <font> Azimuth
<$$font> from Noon will appear to increase a great deal slower than his
Hours do in the middle of Winter . WATTS-1726-2,41.396

I think it should not be utterly be omitted here what is mentioned in
almost all Writings of this kind , <paren> <font> viz. <$$font>
<$$paren> that a Star is said to <font> rise <$$font> or <font> set
Cosmically <$$font> when it rises or sets at <font> Sun-rising <$$font>
. WATTS-1726-2,42.398

'T@ @is said to <font> rise <$$font> or <font> set Achronically <$$font>
if it rise or set at <font> Sun-setting <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,42.399

A Star is said to <font> rise Heliacally <$$font> when it is just come
to such a Distance from the Sun as that 't@ @is no longer hid by the
Sun-Beams . WATTS-1726-2,42.400

And it is said to <font> set Heliacally <$$font> when the Sun approaches
so near to it as that it begins to disappear from our Sight being hid by
the Beams of the Sun . WATTS-1726-2,42.401

The fixt Stars and the three Superior Planets <font> Mars <$$font> ,
<font> Jupiter <$$font> , and <font> Saturn <$$font> rise <font>
Heliacally <$$font> in the Morning , but the <font> Moon <$$font> in the
Evening , WATTS-1726-2,42.402

for 't@ @is in the Evening the <font> New Moon <$$font> first appears ,
coming from her Conjunction with the Sun . WATTS-1726-2,42.403

<font> Note <$$font> , This sort of Rising and Setting of the Stars is
also called <font> Poetical <$$font> ; because the Antient <font> Poets
<$$font> frequently mention it . WATTS-1726-2,42.404

<$$heading>

In order to make the <font> Doctrine of the Sphere <$$font> or Globe yet
more plain and intelligible , let us consider the <font> Inhabitants
<$$font> of the several parts of the World , who may be distinguished
three Ways , <paren> 1. <$$paren> according to the various <font>
Positions of the Globe <$$font> . <paren> 2. <$$paren> According to
the <font> five Zones <$$font> . <paren> 3. <$$paren> In <font>
Relation to one another <$$font> . WATTS-1726-2,43.410

<font> First <$$font> , Let us consider them according to the <font>
various Positions of the Sphere <$$font> , which are either <font>
Direct <$$font> , <font> Parallel <$$font> , or <font> Oblique <$$font>
