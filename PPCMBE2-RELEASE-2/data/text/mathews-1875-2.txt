My awful Dad . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.4

Act I . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.5

<$$heading>

Scene I - MATHEWS-1875-2,3.7

Richard Evergreen's <font> chambers . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.8

Doors in flat <$$font> C. , <font> opening on to stair-case .
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.9

Easy chair and large writing table covered with papers , B. C.
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.10

Press , with alphabetical divisions , against flat R. H.
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.11

Barrister's gown and wig hanging on peg between press and door .
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.12

Watch in case on table . <$$font> MATHEWS-1875-2,3.13

Fibs , Nibs , <font> and <$$font> Dibs <font> discovered , looking over
a map on table . <$$font> MATHEWS-1875-2,3.14

Fibs . There , that red line you see is where the party wall now is ,
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.15

and that dotted line is where the party wall ought to be ,
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.16

at least so the plaintiff says . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.17

Nibs . Why , it ai@ @n't above {TEXT:a_above} two foot of {TEXT:or}
difference according to the scale . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.18

Fibs . It has caused a bigger difference between the parties , anyhow .
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.19

Nibs . I@ @'ve copied more opinions than would cover it all without
counting the margin . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.20

Dibs . And is that little strip what they@ @'ve been fighting these two
years ? MATHEWS-1875-2,3.21

All for a few inches of ground ! MATHEWS-1875-2,3.22

Fibs . Few inches , indeed ! MATHEWS-1875-2,3.23

You do@ @n't know what you@ @'re talking about . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.24

Why one inch of ground is ground enough for an action .
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.25

Dibs . To my certain knowledge , it has cost hundreds already , if only
in counsels' fees . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.26

What nonsense it is , ai@ @n't it , that parties should throw their
money away like that , about what is worth nothing .
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.27

Fibs . How can you be such a fool , Dibs ? MATHEWS-1875-2,3.28

If people only quarrelled about what was worth quarrelling about ,
lawyers must starve . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.29

Worth money indeed ! MATHEWS-1875-2,3.30

It@ @'s been worth a mint to our governor . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.31

The fees he has pocketted are incalculable . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.32

Dibs . No , they are not , MATHEWS-1875-2,3.33

for I@ @'ve calculated them . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.34

Nibs . Well , they@ @'ve finished their journeys when they@ @'ve got
into the governor's pocket . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.35

It@ @'s like Chancery - MATHEWS-1875-2,3.36

once in , they do@ @n't get out again in a hurry . MATHEWS-1875-2,3.37

<P_4>

Fibs . It@ @'s lucky they do@ @n't go into his father's ,
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.39

- they would@ @n't stay long there . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.40

Nibs . No . As soon as they were put into the hole at the top , they@
@'d run out at the hole at the bottom . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.41

Dibs . Oh , he@ @'s a regular sieve , he is . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.42

Ai@ @n't he a jolly old cock ! MATHEWS-1875-2,4.43

Nibs . What , the Major ? MATHEWS-1875-2,4.44

- there ai@ @n't a better old chap going . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.45

Fibs . I only wish his son were like him . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.46

He@ @'s a closefisted card and no mistake . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.47

Dibs . I say , Fibs , what do they call him the Major for ?
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.48

He ai@ @n't been in the army , have he ? MATHEWS-1875-2,4.49

Fibs . Not he . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.50

I do@ @n't know ; MATHEWS-1875-2,4.51

I do@ @n't think he knows himself . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.52

He always says , " Do@ @n't call me Mr. Evergreen - MATHEWS-1875-2,4.53

I shall be taken for my son . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.54

Call me the Major . " MATHEWS-1875-2,4.55

So we call him so . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.56

Dibs . I thought he was a retired officer . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.57

Fibs . Not a bit of it . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.58

He lives on the governor . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.59

Nibs . Then he@ @'s on half-pay , I know ? MATHEWS-1875-2,4.60

Fibs . But be off , MATHEWS-1875-2,4.61

here is the governor . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.62

<paren> <font> rolls up map MATHEWS-1875-2,4.63

Dick . Fibs , has that brief come down yet from Skinners ?
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.67

Fibs . I think not , sir , MATHEWS-1875-2,4.68

but I@ @'ll go and see . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.69

Dick . Why , it must be past - <paren> <font> takes up watch from table
<$$font> <$$paren> MATHEWS-1875-2,4.70

Deuce take it , my watch has stopped again . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.71

<paren> <font> puts it back <$$font> <$$paren> Yes , go .
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.72

Fibs . I will , sir . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.73

<paren> <font> Exit <$$font> , L. <$$paren> MATHEWS-1875-2,4.74

Dick . What dilatory people they are . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.75

I could have read it over while at breakfast ; not that that would have
given me much time . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.76

A cup of tea and an egg are soon despatched , MATHEWS-1875-2,4.77

and I ca@ @n't allow myself more . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.78

How I am obliged to screw , to be sure , to make both ends meet , and
keep up appearances . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.79

A rising barrister has his secret privations and sorrows ,
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.80

that@ @'s certain . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.81

However , I must@ @n't complain . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.82

The sun shines pretty bright before me , MATHEWS-1875-2,4.83

only there are spots upon it - one very large spot that no one knows of
but myself , a blight upon my existence , instead of a fostering ray .
A will-o'-the-wisp instead of a warning beacon , or a guiding star . A
domestic anaconda who eats me out of house and home , swallows up all I
get and is never satisfied . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.84

Well , we must all be born I suppose , MATHEWS-1875-2,4.85

and to be born we must have fathers , MATHEWS-1875-2,4.86

and I have mine . MATHEWS-1875-2,4.87

It@ @'s not my fault ; MATHEWS-1875-2,4.88

I did@ @n't bring him into the world , though he did me ,
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.89

so I am not answerable for his follies , MATHEWS-1875-2,4.90

and must bear the mill-stone round my neck with resignation .

But what nonsense I am talking , MATHEWS-1875-2,5.93

such things are not to be found on every bush . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.94

One may as well look for a nugget in a chandler's shop .

Mrs. B. Law , sir ! Have you done your breakfast already ?
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.98

Dick . Already ! MATHEWS-1875-2,5.99

How long do you suppose it takes to swallow an egg and a cup of tea ?
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.100

Mrs. B. Then why do@ @n't you have two eggs and two cups of tea , like
that dear old gentleman , your father ? MATHEWS-1875-2,5.101

He makes a good breakfast , I can tell you . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.102

Ham and kidneys and - MATHEWS-1875-2,5.103

Dick . That will do . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.104

Mrs. B. Your hat , sir , that went to be done up .

<paren> <font> she puts it on table <$$font> <$$paren>

MATHEWS-1875-2,5.111

Mrs. B. I do@ @n't know , indeed , sir . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.112

Dick . What , is@ @n't he up yet ? MATHEWS-1875-2,5.113

Mrs. B. No , sir , he ca@ @n't be said to be up , MATHEWS-1875-2,5.114

for he has never been to bed ! MATHEWS-1875-2,5.115

Dick . Not been to bed ! MATHEWS-1875-2,5.116

What do you mean ? MATHEWS-1875-2,5.117

Mrs. B. Nothing , sir , MATHEWS-1875-2,5.118

Do@ @n't be angry ; MATHEWS-1875-2,5.119

only he has not been home all night . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.120

Dick . What ! Again ! MATHEWS-1875-2,5.121

Oh , dear me , he@ @'s incorrigible ! MATHEWS-1875-2,5.122

Mrs. B. Yes , sir ; it ai@ @n't quite the thing , is it , sir ?
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.123

He railly ought to reform . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.124

But I@ @'m afraid he@ @'s too old now ; MATHEWS-1875-2,5.125

he has got habits like MATHEWS-1875-2,5.126

and ca@ @n't change them . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.127

Dick . Very bad habits , Mrs. Biggs . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.128

Mrs. B. So they are , sir ; MATHEWS-1875-2,5.129

but what a nice gentleman he is , is@ @n't he , sir ?
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.130

Dick . Hold your tongue , Mrs. Biggs . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.131

A pretty example he sets me - his son . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.132

Mrs. B. So he does , sir ; MATHEWS-1875-2,5.133

but you do@ @n't foller it , do you , sir ? MATHEWS-1875-2,5.134

Dick . Follow it ! MATHEWS-1875-2,5.135

I should think not , indeed . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.136

Mrs. B. Not you , sir . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.137

His conduct certainly is - MATHEWS-1875-2,5.138

there@ @'s no word for it . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.139

Dick . Yes , there is , Mrs. Biggs . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.140

Scandalous , that@ @'s the word . MATHEWS-1875-2,5.141

Mrs. B. At his age , too ! MATHEWS-1875-2,5.142

Turned fifty ! Not that anyone would think it ; MATHEWS-1875-2,5.143

I@ @'m sure he looks young enough to be your - MATHEWS-1875-2,5.144

<P_6>

Dick . That will do , Mrs. Biggs . MATHEWS-1875-2,6.146

I do@ @n't want your observations . MATHEWS-1875-2,6.147

Mrs. B. No , sir , in course you do@ @n't ; MATHEWS-1875-2,6.148

but I do say it@ @'s a pity . MATHEWS-1875-2,6.149

He is such a nice man , so good-natured and so liberal .
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.150

Oh ! ai@ @n't he liberal , MATHEWS-1875-2,6.151

only the Major talks and acts as if he were@ @n't more than twenty .
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.156

Dick . The Major indeed ! MATHEWS-1875-2,6.157

I will <font> not <$$font> have him called the Major .
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.158

Mrs. B. Why , sir , he calls hisself so . MATHEWS-1875-2,6.159

What am I to call him , then ? MATHEWS-1875-2,6.160

Dick . Mr. Evergreen , senior . MATHEWS-1875-2,6.161

Mrs. B. Senior ? MATHEWS-1875-2,6.162

Oh , my stars ! he ai@ @n't much like a senior - much more like major
to my thinking . MATHEWS-1875-2,6.163

He@ @'s younger than you are , sir , MATHEWS-1875-2,6.164

that I <font> will <$$font> say . MATHEWS-1875-2,6.165

Dick . I@ @'ll trouble you not to say anything of the kind ,
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.166

but mind your own business . MATHEWS-1875-2,6.167

Mrs. B. Certainly , sir ; MATHEWS-1875-2,6.168

only one ca@ @n't help thinking what a pity he ca@ @n't be made to
settle down quietly at home , instead of rantipoling about all night .
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.169

Law , sir ! how we would pet him and make him comfortable .
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.170

For my part I@ @'d go through fire and water for him ,
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.171

that I would ! MATHEWS-1875-2,6.172

Dick . Mrs. Biggs , how dare you ! MATHEWS-1875-2,6.173

I forbid you to go through fire and water for my father .
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.174

Mrs. B. Well , I wo@ @n't , sir ; MATHEWS-1875-2,6.175

but you railly ought to scold him well , and make him give up his bad
habits . MATHEWS-1875-2,6.176

It@ @'s time he sowed his wild oats . MATHEWS-1875-2,6.177

I@ @'m sure when I@ @'m alone sometimes it makes me cry to think of it .
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.178

Dick . And pray what have you to do with it ? MATHEWS-1875-2,6.179

Surely my father@ @'s his own master , MATHEWS-1875-2,6.180

and can do as he pleases without your permission . MATHEWS-1875-2,6.181

He@ @'s of age , MATHEWS-1875-2,6.182

do@ @n't forget pool - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.263

come , come , Dick , MATHEWS-1875-2,8.264

shake hands with your old father . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.265

Dick . Old ! MATHEWS-1875-2,8.266

I wish he was old ! MATHEWS-1875-2,8.267

Ever. Well , that@ @'s a compliment at any rate . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.268

All in good time , my boy - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.269

all in good time . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.270

We ca@ @n't all grow old in a minute like you . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.271

You sprang like Minerva from the brain of Jove , armed cap-à-pie - all
the better for you ; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.272

but make allowances for the weakness of those who have been less
favoured . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.273

There , do@ @n't look so serious . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.274

Why ca@ @n't you be jovial and pleasant like me ? MATHEWS-1875-2,8.275

Dick . Seriousness is my profession . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.276

Ever. And liberty@ @'s mine . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.277

So let@ @'s each follow our vocation . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.278

Why a parson might as well reproach a mountebank for throwing a
somersault . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.279

That@ @'s the way he gets his living . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.280

The parson has got his living ; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.281

so they do@ @n't meet on equal terms . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.282

The somersault that adorns the saw-dust would , I grant you , be
inappropriate in the pulpit - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.283

each has his mode of self-assertion , MATHEWS-1875-2,8.284

that@ @'s all . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.285

The parson says " Here I am , " MATHEWS-1875-2,8.286

the clown says " Here we are . " MATHEWS-1875-2,8.287

What@ @'s the difference ? MATHEWS-1875-2,8.288

The clown adopts the legal plural , the parson the parochial singular .
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.289

That is our case . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.290

I@ @'m the regal plural , MATHEWS-1875-2,8.291

you are the legal singular . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.292

Dick . Pooh ! there@ @'s no arguing with you . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.293

Ever. I know it . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.294

Then why argue ? MATHEWS-1875-2,8.295

our states are apart . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.296

It takes a long time , of course , for a grub to become a butterfly .
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.297

I@ @'m a butterfly ; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.298

I@ @'m arrived . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.299

You@ @'re still plodding on ; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.300

you@ @'re the grub . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.301

Dick . <paren> <font> rises <$$font> <$$paren> Thank you ;
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.302

you are complimentary at any rate . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.303

Ever. Not at all ; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.304

it@ @'s the plain truth without flattery . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.305

Come , MATHEWS-1875-2,8.306

burst your shell - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.307

let out , my boy - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.308

be gay and joyous . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.309

Make a pun , Dick , MATHEWS-1875-2,8.310

make a pun ; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.311

it will do you a world of good . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.312

Dick . I never made a pun in my life . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.313

Ever. I know you did@ @n't , MATHEWS-1875-2,8.314

so it@ @'s time you began . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.315

You ought to be ashamed of yourself at your time of life .
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.316

Dick . Doctor Johnson says , " The man who would make a pun would pick
a pocket . " MATHEWS-1875-2,8.317

Ever. Bosh ! Men who make puns never pick pockets ;
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.318

it@ @'s quite the other way . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.319

You@ @'re an illustration . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.320

You never make puns MATHEWS-1875-2,8.321

and you are picking pockets all day long . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.322

Dick . Only in the way of my profession , dad , only in the way of my
profession . MATHEWS-1875-2,8.323

<P_9>

Ever. The way of your profession - that@ @'s good !
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.325

why a foot-pad might make the same excuse . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.326

Hang it all ! MATHEWS-1875-2,9.327

be alive . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.328

One would think that you were my father instead of I yours .
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.329

I@ @'m deuced glad you@ @'re not though . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.330

I should be traced every five minutes . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.331

Birch-brooms would be at a premium . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.332

And after all what@ @'s my crime . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.333

Preferring pleasant society out of doors to dulness within ;
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.334

for , my dear Dick , if you think you are pleasant company you are
mistaken . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.335

Surely I@ @'ve done enough for you in my time , MATHEWS-1875-2,9.336

and it@ @'s but right you should do a little for me .
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.337

Did@ @n't I pay your quarterly school bills , and your quarterly broken
windows ? Which I do@ @n't believe you ever broke .
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.338

You never were young enough for that . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.339

Did@ @n't I say to you , " Dick , you@ @'re an old man of ten . A
pedantic little ant . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.340

You@ @'ll never set the Thames on fire , MATHEWS-1875-2,9.341

you@ @'re not agreeable , MATHEWS-1875-2,9.342

and you@ @'re not good-looking ; MATHEWS-1875-2,9.343

but you@ @'ll do for a lawyer . " MATHEWS-1875-2,9.344

And did@ @n't I , like a Spartan of old , dine off my solitary chop ,
red on one side and black on the other , at the tavern round the corner
, while you were eating your terms ? MATHEWS-1875-2,9.345

And devilish good eating , too , by all accounts . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.346

And now you are a rising barrister - MATHEWS-1875-2,9.347

think of that ! MATHEWS-1875-2,9.348

How many barristers never rise , except in the morning ?
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.349

Did@ @n't I set you an example of temperance and sobriety ?
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.350

and you do@ @n't even thank me for your being able to breakfast on a cup
of tea and an egg , instead of indulging in all sorts of indigestible
<font> cates . <$$font> MATHEWS-1875-2,9.351

Dick . Oh , yes ! I certainly thank you very greatly for <font> that .
<$$font> MATHEWS-1875-2,9.352

Ever. Very well , then . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.353

Let me have my time . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.354

I sacrificed {TEXT:sacrified} the spring-time of my youth to <font> you
<$$font> , MATHEWS-1875-2,9.355

so do@ @n't begrudge me my little innocent pleasures .
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.356

Let me enjoy my Indian summer - MATHEWS-1875-2,9.357

let me catch the last rays of my setting sun , and kill time joyously -
till time kills me . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.358

Dick . My dear dad , far would it be from me to grudge you your
innocent pleasures , as you call them ; MATHEWS-1875-2,9.359

but I denounce them as irrational and immoral . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.360

Ever. Irrational ? MATHEWS-1875-2,9.361

That@ @'s good ! MATHEWS-1875-2,9.362

Do you call suppers irrational ? MATHEWS-1875-2,9.363

Do you call billiards immoral ! MATHEWS-1875-2,9.364

On the contrary , I follow Shakespeare's teaching - " Find tongues in
cheese , books in the flowing cup , sermons in pool , and good in
everything . " MATHEWS-1875-2,9.365

Dick . Yes , in dice - in women - in - MATHEWS-1875-2,9.366

Ever. Stop - MATHEWS-1875-2,9.367

not a word against women . MATHEWS-1875-2,9.368

They are angels - goddesses , when you are not <font> married <$$font>
to them - MATHEWS-1875-2,9.369

then , I grant you , you find out that they are merely women .
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.370

And yet see how long I endured your mother ! MATHEWS-1875-2,9.371

and all for what ? MATHEWS-1875-2,9.372

For you , you ungrateful varlet ! MATHEWS-1875-2,9.373

<P_10>

Dick . Yes ; but the women I speak of - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.375

Ever. Well , what of them ? MATHEWS-1875-2,10.376

- they do@ @n't harm you . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.377

Dick . I do@ @n't know that . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.378

When equivocal young females present themselves at my chambers and
mistake my room for yours - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.379

Ever. Pshaw ! MATHEWS-1875-2,10.380

That@ @'s easily remedied . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.381

Stick up a paper on your door - " The surly young bear just stepped out
- back in five minutes ; " and under it " N.B. - The jolly old Major
always in form ten till four . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.382

Wipe your feet on the mat . " MATHEWS-1875-2,10.383

Dick . There again , now why will you call yourself the Major when you@
@'re not a major ? MATHEWS-1875-2,10.384

Ever. Not a major ? MATHEWS-1875-2,10.385

Who says I@ @'m not a major ? MATHEWS-1875-2,10.386

The deuce I@ @'m not ! MATHEWS-1875-2,10.387

Why ai@ @n't I a major ? MATHEWS-1875-2,10.388

You are Evergreen minor - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.389

I@ @'m Evergreen major , MATHEWS-1875-2,10.390

that@ @'s my commission - Ursa Minor - Ursa Major .
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.391

Dick . Yes , but people think that you are in the army .
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.392

Ever. Well , let them think so ; MATHEWS-1875-2,10.393

there@ @'s no disgrace in it , is there ? MATHEWS-1875-2,10.394

We ca@ @n't all be lawyers . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.395

Dick . Ah , my dear dad , you@ @'re too young for your age .
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.396

Ever. And you@ @'re not young enough for yours . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.397

I@ @'m a relic of the good old school - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.398

you@ @'re a mushroom of the new . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.399

You are all utilitarian . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.400

I belong to the age of poetry and chivalry - when women were idols , and
we wrote sonnets to their eyebrows , when we ruined ourselves for a
smile , and risked our lives for a ribbon ; MATHEWS-1875-2,10.401

and here I stand erect among you pigmy greybeards , the living statue of
eternal youth . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.402

Dick . Go on , MATHEWS-1875-2,10.403

go on , MATHEWS-1875-2,10.404

you@ @'re on the popular side ; MATHEWS-1875-2,10.405

as Mrs. Biggs said just now , you are only twenty .
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.406

Ever. No , I am not twenty , MATHEWS-1875-2,10.407

but I try to act as if I were , MATHEWS-1875-2,10.408

and I succeed sometimes . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.409

Biggs is a shrewd old girl . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.410

By-@ @the-@ @bye , Dick , the quarter@ @'s nearly up .
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.411

How time flies , does@ @n't it ? MATHEWS-1875-2,10.412

And now everything flies with it <paren> <font> feeling in his pocket
<$$font> <$$paren> MATHEWS-1875-2,10.413

Dick . Yes , and that reminds me , MATHEWS-1875-2,10.414

I must fly down to Westminster . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.415

Ever. <paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> He does@ @n't bite .
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.416

<paren> <font> aloud <$$font> <$$paren> I say , Dickey , you have@ @n't
such a thing as a stray tenner flying about , have you ?
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.417

Dick . No . I have@ @n't . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.418

But I@ @'ll tell you what I <font> have <$$font> got . <paren> <font>
goes to table <$$font> <$$paren> MATHEWS-1875-2,10.419

Ever. Oh , well I@ @'ll make a fiver do . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.420

A pound or two more or less does@ @n't much matter .
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.421

I@ @'m not particular . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.422

Dick . I know you@ @'re not , MATHEWS-1875-2,10.423

but I am . MATHEWS-1875-2,10.424

Here are thirty-seven pounds two and ninepence - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.425

Ever. Oh , my dear Dick , you@ @'re too liberal .
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.426

I really do@ @n't want - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.427

<P_11>

Dick . Which I@ @'ve paid for you during the last month .
MATHEWS-1875-2,11.429

There are the receipts and the County Court summonses . <paren> <font>
giving papers <$$font> <$$paren> MATHEWS-1875-2,11.430

Ever. What the deuce did you pay them for ? MATHEWS-1875-2,11.431

It was no business of yours ; MATHEWS-1875-2,11.432

they could have waited , MATHEWS-1875-2,11.433

they are used to it . MATHEWS-1875-2,11.434

" A fig for care , a fig for woe . MATHEWS-1875-2,11.435

If I ca@ @n't pay , why I can owe . " MATHEWS-1875-2,11.436

You always seem to take the part of my creditors instead of mine .
MATHEWS-1875-2,11.437

Well , I suppose I must manage with two or three sovereigns , just till
I get my next quarter . MATHEWS-1875-2,11.438

Dick . Good-bye , dad ! MATHEWS-1875-2,11.439

If anyone comes , shew them into the clerk's office . <paren> <font>

a new hat ? MATHEWS-1875-2,11.446

You extravagant young dog ! MATHEWS-1875-2,11.447

Dick . No , it@ @'s only an old one done up . MATHEWS-1875-2,11.448

Ever. Why did@ @n't you ask me ? MATHEWS-1875-2,11.449

I could have lent you an old one that@ @'s been done up for some time ,
and have saved you the expense . MATHEWS-1875-2,11.450

Dick . I dare@ @say you could - equally obliged . <paren> <font> going

Mrs. B. Your watch , sir , MATHEWS-1875-2,11.452

Dick . I do@ @n't want it ; MATHEWS-1875-2,11.454

it has stopped . MATHEWS-1875-2,11.455

Ever. Have you got your purse , Dick ? MATHEWS-1875-2,11.456

Dick . Oh , yes . <paren> <font> with meaning <$$font> <$$paren> I@

But no , he deserves a lesson . <paren> <font> Exit <$$font> , C.
<$$paren> MATHEWS-1875-2,11.460

Ever. Now , Biggs , I ask you , did you ever see anything like that ?
MATHEWS-1875-2,11.461

Mrs. B. Like what , sir ? MATHEWS-1875-2,11.462

Ever. Fathers refusing money to their sons is common enough .
MATHEWS-1875-2,11.463

But sons refusing money to their fathers is something unheard of -
MATHEWS-1875-2,11.464

it@ @'s monstrous . MATHEWS-1875-2,11.465

Mrs. B. So it is , sir ; MATHEWS-1875-2,11.466

for my part I ca@ @n't think how anyone can refuse you anything
{TEXT:anythink} . MATHEWS-1875-2,11.467

Ever. Biggs , you@ @'re an angel in an apron . MATHEWS-1875-2,11.468

But what the deuce am I to do ? MATHEWS-1875-2,11.469

I give a dinner at Richmond to-day , to a couple of dramatic authors and
two lovely women , Charlotte FitzPlantagenet {TEXT:Fitz_Plantagenet} and
Evangeline {TEXT:Evangeline.} Clara Vere de Vere , at the Star and
Garter , MATHEWS-1875-2,11.470

and you do@ @n't get all the <P_12> delicacies of the season at the Star

Whitebait , champagne , flowers , and then the carriage down and back ,
MATHEWS-1875-2,12.472

and I@ @'ve only got five-and-twenty shillings in my pocket .
MATHEWS-1875-2,12.473

What do you say to that , Biggs ? MATHEWS-1875-2,12.474

Mrs. B. What do I say ! MATHEWS-1875-2,12.475

Why look here , sir ; MATHEWS-1875-2,12.476

I@ @'ve got a few pounds saved by in my cupboard , MATHEWS-1875-2,12.477

and if they@ @'ll be - MATHEWS-1875-2,12.478

Ever. Hush ! Biggs . Not another word . MATHEWS-1875-2,12.479

There@ @'s half-@ @a-@ @crown for you . <paren> <font> gives it

Never make such an offer again ; MATHEWS-1875-2,12.481

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> or who knows but in a weak

Mrs. B. Well , I wo@ @n't , sir . MATHEWS-1875-2,12.483

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> What a duck he is !
MATHEWS-1875-2,12.484

I hope you@ @'re not offended , Major . MATHEWS-1875-2,12.485

But , really , sometimes I forget your age , MATHEWS-1875-2,12.486

and treat you like a little boy who has spent all his money in lollipops
. MATHEWS-1875-2,12.487

Ever. Offended , Biggs ? MATHEWS-1875-2,12.488

On the contrary , I@ @'m flattered by the comparison .
MATHEWS-1875-2,12.489

I@ @'m not exactly a little boy , it@ @'s true , MATHEWS-1875-2,12.490

and it is some time since I bought lollipops , MATHEWS-1875-2,12.491

and I@ @'m sorry for it . MATHEWS-1875-2,12.492

They are cheaper than some of the sweetmeats I indulge in now .
MATHEWS-1875-2,12.493

But I must go and take off these evening things . MATHEWS-1875-2,12.494

I do@ @n't want all London to know that I@ @'ve been out all night .
MATHEWS-1875-2,12.495

Mrs. B. And that reminds me , sir , MATHEWS-1875-2,12.496

Mr. Loosefit has been here again . MATHEWS-1875-2,12.497

Ever. Loosefit ? MATHEWS-1875-2,12.498

Who@ @'s he ? MATHEWS-1875-2,12.499

Mrs. B. That nasty creditor of yours - you know .

Ever. Oh , yes , I know he@ @'s my creditor . MATHEWS-1875-2,12.501

But what does he want ? MATHEWS-1875-2,12.502

Mrs. B. He says he wants to talk to you about his little bill .
MATHEWS-1875-2,12.503

Ever. The deuce he does ! MATHEWS-1875-2,12.504

What stuff ! MATHEWS-1875-2,12.505

he has talked about it over and over again . MATHEWS-1875-2,12.506

I wonder he@ @'s not sick of the subject ! MATHEWS-1875-2,12.507

I@ @'m sure I am . MATHEWS-1875-2,12.508

I tell you what , Biggs , MATHEWS-1875-2,12.509

if he says another word about it I@ @'ll never see him again as long as

Mrs. B. And there@ @'s two parcels come from May's , in Bow Street .

Mrs. B. In the kitchen , sir . MATHEWS-1875-2,12.514

Ever. Madam , Mr. Evergreen is flattered , I@ @'m sure .
MATHEWS-1875-2,14.588

Ever. A widow ! MATHEWS-1875-2,14.600

Is it possible ? MATHEWS-1875-2,14.601

I am surprised , indeed ; MATHEWS-1875-2,14.602

Mat. I am afraid you are mistaken , sir . MATHEWS-1875-2,14.604

Ever. Certainly I will - MATHEWS-1875-2,14.612

pray speak out without reserve . MATHEWS-1875-2,14.613

Mat. I was married at a very early age to a rich and most respectable
gentleman , but unfortunately considerably older than myself .
MATHEWS-1875-2,14.614

Ever. I have heard of such things before ; MATHEWS-1875-2,14.615

but proceed . MATHEWS-1875-2,14.616

Mat. The death of my husband has placed me in a most embarrassing
position MATHEWS-1875-2,14.617

Ever. I can believe it , poor young lady ! Poor young widow !
MATHEWS-1875-2,14.618

Mat. For he has left a will bequeathing me all he possesses - a

<P_15>

Mat. But on one fatal condition . MATHEWS-1875-2,15.622

Fearing that I might fall into the hands of some thoughtless young
spendthrift , who would dissipate my means , he exacts that I shall
marry no one under fifty years of age . MATHEWS-1875-2,15.623

Ever. Unheard_of tyranny ! MATHEWS-1875-2,15.624

Jealousy - pure jealousy - posthumous jealousy ! MATHEWS-1875-2,15.625

Mat. <paren> <font> sighing <$$font> <$$paren> You understand my

Of course I understand it too well , MATHEWS-1875-2,15.628

This inhuman clause is revolting . MATHEWS-1875-2,15.630

You@ @'ve had one fifty years of it - MATHEWS-1875-2,15.631

you do@ @n't want another . MATHEWS-1875-2,15.632

Mat. No , sir . MATHEWS-1875-2,15.633

Ever. Not but what there are some men who , though turned fifty , carry
their years so lightly that - MATHEWS-1875-2,15.634

no matter - you are virtually doomed to widowhood - you with your charms

Mat. I@ @'ve been a widow more than a twelvemonth already .
MATHEWS-1875-2,15.637

Ever. Already ! MATHEWS-1875-2,15.638

Twelve months ! MATHEWS-1875-2,15.639

- an age . MATHEWS-1875-2,15.640

Mat. And now , sir , I throw myself on your skill and experience to
upset this odious will . MATHEWS-1875-2,15.641

I@ @'ll deliver you from this monstrous injustice ,
MATHEWS-1875-2,15.658

never fear . MATHEWS-1875-2,15.659

I@ @'ll annul this ridiculous - this infamous will - a will subversive

Mat. Is it really ? MATHEWS-1875-2,15.661

Ever. Of course it is , madam . MATHEWS-1875-2,15.662

Your departed husband has@ @n't a leg to stand upon .
MATHEWS-1875-2,15.663

What@ @'s the object of marriage ? MATHEWS-1875-2,15.664

Reciprocity . MATHEWS-1875-2,15.665

Will the law recognise and tolerate a reciprocity , which , like that of
the Irishwoman , is only on one side ? MATHEWS-1875-2,15.666

No ! I say no ! MATHEWS-1875-2,15.667

Do away with reciprocity , what remains ? MATHEWS-1875-2,15.668

A mere cold formality , destructive of social order and the happiness of
nations . MATHEWS-1875-2,15.669

The jealous caprice of this departed monster is a gross attack upon the
rights of the <P_16> subject , calculated to undermine the dearest
aspirations of youth , and suppress the brightest hopes of humanity .
MATHEWS-1875-2,16.670

I fancy myself at this moment pleading before an enlightened judge and
an intelligent jury of my fellow countrymen . MATHEWS-1875-2,16.671

I would say - MATHEWS-1875-2,16.672

Mat. Oh ! how glad I am I came to you ! MATHEWS-1875-2,16.673

Ever. I would say : My lord , and gentlemen of the jury , - I lay
before you , confident of success , this one unanswerable argument ,
this one incontrovertible conjugal maxim - well-assorted union .
MATHEWS-1875-2,16.674

You know the great legal dictum of Blackstone in his Commentaries .
MATHEWS-1875-2,16.675

" Like purse , like tastes , and like age , make the best marriage . "
MATHEWS-1875-2,16.676

It will , perhaps , be argued against me , that this seems to imply a
recommendation to marryage , MATHEWS-1875-2,16.677

but that is a legal fallacy . MATHEWS-1875-2,16.678

As well might a carriage be described as a vehicle only intended to
carryage , MATHEWS-1875-2,16.679

and I wonder my learned friend can stoop to so paltry a subterfuge .
MATHEWS-1875-2,16.680

Look at my interesting , my unhappy , suffering client .
MATHEWS-1875-2,16.681

What do you see ? MATHEWS-1875-2,16.682

A woman ! MATHEWS-1875-2,16.683

And what a woman ! Young , beautiful , full of life and promise ; once
a brilliant butterfly " born to sparkle in the sun , like an unbodied
joy whose race is just begun . " Blythe as a summer's day ; destined by

and shall the jealousy of erring man condemn her to eternal winter ?
MATHEWS-1875-2,16.690

Perish the thought ! MATHEWS-1875-2,16.691

A selfish friend may have conceived this unheard_of barbarity ;

MATHEWS-1875-2,16.693

No , no , I read it in your faces . MATHEWS-1875-2,16.694

but really it is the last thing I should have expected , to find Punch
in a barrister's gown and wig . MATHEWS-1875-2,17.712

Ever. Well , madam , I must confess it is not strictly professional .
MATHEWS-1875-2,17.713

At the first glance it may appear , legally , a little out of order ;
MATHEWS-1875-2,17.714

but the simple fact is that the Long Vacation is just commencing ,
MATHEWS-1875-2,17.715

and a learned judge , well-known on the Northern Circuit , whose name of
course I am too delicate to disclose , gives his annual <font>
bal_masqué <$$font> in honour of the holiday . A grave and learned man
in term time , but fond of an innocent laugh once a year - only once a
year during vacation ; MATHEWS-1875-2,17.716

and though quite against my usual serious habits , I am bound , as a
member of the Bar , to honour his eccentric whim , MATHEWS-1875-2,17.717

and as it is enjoined in the programme that every man shall assume the
costume most opposed to his natural character , I had selected that of
Punch , as in my case the most appropriate disguise .
MATHEWS-1875-2,17.718

Mat. Pray do@ @n't apologise , sir ; MATHEWS-1875-2,17.719

I am only too glad to find gaiety and good-humour not wholly excluded

MATHEWS-1875-2,17.720

I little thought while listening to your eloquent pleading just now that
- Ever. Punch was pulling the strings . MATHEWS-1875-2,17.721

Nor was he , believe me . MATHEWS-1875-2,17.722

I was in earnest MATHEWS-1875-2,17.723

I throw aside the mask of folly . MATHEWS-1875-2,17.728

Punch disappears - MATHEWS-1875-2,17.729

the barrister remains , ready to give grave and solid advice to his

Mat. I believe it , sir . MATHEWS-1875-2,17.731

And should I decide upon trying this momentous question , rest assured I
