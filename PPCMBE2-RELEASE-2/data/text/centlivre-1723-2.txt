Mind thy own Business . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.28

and never puzzle thy Noddle with Thought . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.29

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Philip , <font> and <$$font> Tally .
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.30

Bless me ! CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.31

my Lord , and Sir <font> Philip ! <$$font> CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.32

- I am asham'd to be caught in this Disorder ! CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.33

<font> Sir Phil. <$$font> My Lord and I have been fetching a Walk ,
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.34

and I could not persuade his Lordship to pass by your Door , Cousin ,
without calling . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.35

You are his North , CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.36

and he is embark'd in the Cock-boat of Love , CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.37

and is constantly pointing this way . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.38

<font> Wid. <$$font> You are very pleasant this Morning , Sir <font>

But . - CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.40

<font> Tally . <$$font> I ask your Pardon , Madam ;
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.41

undertook to be Master of the Ceremonies , as well as to answer the
Reproaches I might reasonably expect from you , for this Liberty -
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.42

<font> Wid. <$$font> Oh , good my Lord , no Apology !
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.43

That ought to be done by me for the Disorder your Lordship finds me in .
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.44

- Go , Beesom , CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.45

and look for your Fellow-Puzzles , CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.46

and ask 'em , Why they leave my Doors open ? CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.47

I shall be robb'd one of these Days . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.48

- Sure , never any-body was so fatigu'd with Servants as I am .
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.49

Did you ever visit a Lady in a Stable before , my Lord ? !
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.50

I shall be stuck , mir'd , laid fast , and forc'd to be dug out like a
Potatoe . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.51

<font> Tally . <$$font> A Stable , Madam ! CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.54

I protest I think your House is as much in Order , as any Lady's in
<font> London . <$$font> CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.55

<font> Sir Phil. <$$font> Ay , my Lord , there are few of the Quality
such Housewives , as my Cousin . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.56

If it be your Lordship's good Fortune to marry her , she@ @'ll set the
Ladies at Court a Pattern . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.57

<font> Wid. <$$font> Fy , Sir <font> Philip <$$font> !
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.58

This to my Face ! CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.59

it looks like Flattery . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.60

<P_37>

<font> Tally . <$$font> What would be Flattery to another , is but
doing you Justice , Madam . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.62

- <font> Wid. <$$font> Women have no Defence against the fine Things
you well-bred Men say . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.63

To raise our Vanity , and make us have a good Opinion of ourselves , you
are sure , is one way to be well in our Esteem . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.64

<font> Tally . <$$font> I should think myself the happiest Man living ,
if I cou'd perceive I had the least Share in yours , Madam .

<font> Wid. <$$font> Wou'd you have me marry a Man as soon as he asks
me the Question , Sir <font> Philip ? <$$font> CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.71

I think , to have an Amour with a Person of Rank known and talk'd of ,
is one of the greatest Inducements to Matrimony ; especially if it gives
the rest of my Sex Pain . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.72

Weeks , before she sew'd Three Penny-Canes round the Bottom of her Shirt
, instead of a Hoop-Petticoat . CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.196

<font> Sir Phil. <$$font> That was something better than a Wench at my
House , who dis-rob'd a Barrel , and let all the Ale about the Cellar .

One of the Ends of the Hoop working out , discover'd the Trick ,

<font> Oliv. <$$font> How ill dost thou interpret my Surprize !
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,51.510

The unexpected Joy of seeing thee , When no one Means supply'd me with a
Hope , To tell thee , - That to_Morrow - CENTLIVRE-1723-2,51.511

<font> Sir John . <$$font> Thou art to be my Sister .
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,51.512

But when the Glowing of the Passion@ @'s over , and pinching Cold of
Winter follows , will <P_52> amorous Sighs supply the Want of Fire ? Or
