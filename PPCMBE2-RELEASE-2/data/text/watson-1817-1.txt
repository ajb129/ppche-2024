<font> A. <$$font> Yes , the printed bills ; WATSON-1817-1,1,84.109

and he asked me the reason why I had not objected to it in the first
place ; WATSON-1817-1,1,84.110

I said , I did not see any harm in the bill when he brought it to me ,
but I had since considered of it , and thought it would be dangerous to
have any thing to do with it . WATSON-1817-1,1,84.111

<font> Q. <$$font> State what passed between you and him on the subject
? WATSON-1817-1,1,84.112

<font> A. <$$font> I told him that we knew very well what it was to
call a meeting ; WATSON-1817-1,1,84.113

but when they were assembled , who was to be accountable for their
actions , in case they should do any mischief . WATSON-1817-1,1,84.114

<font> Q. <$$font> Did he make any answer to that ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,84.115

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; he said there were many meetings in the
country called ; - that nothing had taken place ; - that the people had
gone home peaceably and quietly , that no danger might result from the
meeting ; WATSON-1817-1,1,84.116

I told him , I did not know how this might be , and did not like to have
any risk , WATSON-1817-1,1,84.117

and young Watson asked what I was afraid of . WATSON-1817-1,1,84.118

he asked me what I was afraid of ; WATSON-1817-1,1,85.124

the old one who was present , said , suppose I was afraid of having my
house pulled about my ears by the vengeance of the mob , for that I was
perverting the ends of justice more than supporting it , by refusing to
print the bills ; WATSON-1817-1,1,85.125

young Watson asked me to give him a copy . WATSON-1817-1,1,85.126

<font> Q. <$$font> One of the printed bills ? WATSON-1817-1,1,85.127

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , one of the bills that I had printed ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,85.128

I said , as my name was to the bill , any printer would print it
afterwards , without thinking there was any danger .
WATSON-1817-1,1,85.129

<font> Q. <$$font> You mentioned that as an objection to giving him the
bill . WATSON-1817-1,1,85.130

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; for seeing a printer's name to it , is a great
inducement to another to do it . WATSON-1817-1,1,85.131

I had printed it , WATSON-1817-1,1,85.132

but I declined to give him one ; WATSON-1817-1,1,85.133

he said he wanted one , WATSON-1817-1,1,85.134

it was not to dictate to a printer , but to give it to Mr. Hunt .
WATSON-1817-1,1,85.135

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you make any answer to it ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,85.136

or did you give it him ? WATSON-1817-1,1,85.137

<font> A. <$$font> No , I did not ; WATSON-1817-1,1,85.138

I told him I knew Mr. Henry Hunt very well , and that if he would
produce me his letter that he wanted it , I would myself send him one ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,85.139

he said no , WATSON-1817-1,1,85.140

if I would not send it without his letter , I should not send it with .
WATSON-1817-1,1,85.141

<font> Q. <$$font> You declined letting him have one to send to Mr.
Hunt ? WATSON-1817-1,1,85.142

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; WATSON-1817-1,1,85.143

and he went away WATSON-1817-1,1,85.144

and came back again in five minutes afterwards . WATSON-1817-1,1,85.145

received , the difference of the pound note ; WATSON-1817-1,1,86.150

I had taken half an crown {TEXT:half-a-crown} , I believe ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,86.151

it was making up the pound note ; WATSON-1817-1,1,86.152

I gave them the paper I had bought out of the pound note , and the
difference . WATSON-1817-1,1,86.153

<font> Q. <$$font> You had printed some of the bills ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,86.154

WATSON-1817-1,1,96.447

<font> A. <$$font> In my public shop . WATSON-1817-1,1,96.448

<font> Q. <$$font> Was an order given you for any number ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,96.449

<font> A. <$$font> I believe 3000 or 3500 small , and 500 large .
WATSON-1817-1,1,96.450

I believe an order was given for 3000 small , WATSON-1817-1,1,96.451

but there were about 500 more done afterwards . WATSON-1817-1,1,96.452

<font> Q. <$$font> When you had printed them , to whom were they
delivered ? WATSON-1817-1,1,96.453

<font> A. <$$font> A great number of different people called for them .
WATSON-1817-1,1,96.454

<font> Q. <$$font> Had you had any orders as to the delivery of them ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,96.455

nothing ; WATSON-1817-1,1,96.456

they were fetched away promiscuously , by different individuals .

WATSON-1817-1,1,96.458

<font> Q. <$$font> How came you to do so ? WATSON-1817-1,1,96.460

<font> A. <$$font> I naturally thought that those who fetched the bills
came from the people who employed me . WATSON-1817-1,1,96.461

I thought by means of Mr. Preston , I should know who the persons were
that fetched them . WATSON-1817-1,1,96.462

you printed ? WATSON-1817-1,1,96.463

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> He must be either a person
connected with the purpose or not ; WATSON-1817-1,1,98.505

now whether he is or is not it is a mere simple bringing of this bill :
WATSON-1817-1,1,98.506

he is at present a mere human being , by whom this act is done .
WATSON-1817-1,1,98.507

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; it might be two or three days from the time of
his giving the order ; WATSON-1817-1,1,99.542

about the 28th , I should think it was . WATSON-1817-1,1,99.543

<font> Q. <$$font> Had you any conversation with Mr. Watson , as to
the manuscript from which those were printed ? WATSON-1817-1,1,99.544

<font> A. <$$font> No , I had no conversation with Mr. Watson about

<font> A. <$$font> I have not seen it since the time it was composed ,
that I recollect . WATSON-1817-1,1,100.570

<font> Q. <$$font> At the time it was composed , it was in your shop ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,100.571

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , of course it was . WATSON-1817-1,1,100.572

<font> Q. <$$font> Since that time you have not seen it ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,100.573

nor do you know what has become of it ? WATSON-1817-1,1,100.574

<font> A. <$$font> No . WATSON-1817-1,1,100.575

<font> Q. <$$font> When the first order was given you , who delivered
you the manuscript ; WATSON-1817-1,1,100.576

- Preston , I think you said ? WATSON-1817-1,1,100.577

<font> A. <$$font> No , I did not say Preston , WATSON-1817-1,1,100.578

which of them it was I can@ @not say , WATSON-1817-1,1,100.580

Mr. Watson was present . WATSON-1817-1,1,100.581

<font> Q. <$$font> This manuscript being produced , was it read over in
his presence , WATSON-1817-1,1,100.582

or did he see it before it was delivered to you ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,100.583

<font> A. <$$font> I read it over . WATSON-1817-1,1,100.584

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Did you read it alone ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,100.585

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> How did you read it over ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,100.586

<font> A. <$$font> The same as I would any thing else .
WATSON-1817-1,1,100.587

<P_1,101>

<font> Q. <$$font> To yourself ? WATSON-1817-1,1,101.589

<font> A. <$$font> No , I read it out . WATSON-1817-1,1,101.590

<font> Q. <$$font> Can you take upon yourself to swear that Watson
heard you ? WATSON-1817-1,1,101.591

<font> A. <$$font> I think I can take upon myself to swear that he did
. WATSON-1817-1,1,101.592

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you take upon yourself to swear that he heard you
? WATSON-1817-1,1,101.593

<font> A. <$$font> I do really believe he must have heard me .
WATSON-1817-1,1,101.594

<font> Q. <$$font> Will you take upon yourself to swear that he heard
you ? WATSON-1817-1,1,101.595

<font> A. <$$font> I have already sworn , WATSON-1817-1,1,101.596

and I can@ @not go any further . WATSON-1817-1,1,101.597

<font> Q. <$$font> What have you sworn ? WATSON-1817-1,1,101.598

<font> A. <$$font> That he was present when the manuscript was given to
me . WATSON-1817-1,1,101.599

<font> Q. <$$font> Was it read over so that you can take upon yourself
to swear that he heard its contents ? WATSON-1817-1,1,101.600

<font> A. <$$font> It is impossible to swear that a man heard ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,101.601

for a man may turn a deaf ear to what is read . WATSON-1817-1,1,101.602

<font> Q. <$$font> Will you swear that he heard it ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,101.603

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not understand the meaning of the word swear
further . WATSON-1817-1,1,101.604

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> I understand him to swear that
Watson was present , and that he read it out . WATSON-1817-1,1,101.605

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> My question to him , is ,
whether he is satisfied Mr. Watson must have heard it .
WATSON-1817-1,1,101.606

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> That is impossible ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,101.607

he has said all a man by possibility can say , that he believes he heard
it ; that he pronounced it so loud , that a person , must , he thinks ,
have heard it . WATSON-1817-1,1,101.608

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> What I ask him , and what I want
to know is , whether he believes Mr. Watson heard it .
WATSON-1817-1,1,101.609

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> That he has said already , that he
believes he heard him ; WATSON-1817-1,1,101.610

but if a man swears that another heard it , he would not be believed ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,101.611

he would be thought to be rash . WATSON-1817-1,1,101.612

<P_1,102>

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> I wish to know whether there is
any misapprehension upon this subject , WATSON-1817-1,1,102.614

and would repeat the question . WATSON-1817-1,1,102.615

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Oh , certainly .
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.616

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> Upon the oath you have taken ,
do you believe Mr. Watson heard it ? WATSON-1817-1,1,102.617

<font> A. <$$font> The only thing I could do would be to read it as I
read it then , WATSON-1817-1,1,102.618

and then their Lordships and the Jury may judge whether he must not have
heard it . WATSON-1817-1,1,102.619

<font> Q. <$$font> Will you listen to the question ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.620

Do you believe that Mr. Watson heard it ? WATSON-1817-1,1,102.621

<font> A. <$$font> It is impossible I can swear that another heard it .
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.622

<font> Q. <$$font> The question is not that , WATSON-1817-1,1,102.623

and you must understand the question . WATSON-1817-1,1,102.624

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> The question now put to you is not
of that description which might be objectionable ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.625

but the question is , whether you swear that you believe he heard it .
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.626

<font> A. <$$font> Certainly . WATSON-1817-1,1,102.627

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> So as to be aware of the
contents of it . WATSON-1817-1,1,102.628

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . WATSON-1817-1,1,102.629

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you been examined before as to these bills ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.630

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , at No 5 , Stone Buildings .
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.631

<font> Q. <$$font> Was that the only time ? WATSON-1817-1,1,102.632

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , it was . WATSON-1817-1,1,102.633

<font> Q. <$$font> That was at Mr. Litchfield's Chambers , I presume ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.634

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I believe it was . WATSON-1817-1,1,102.635

<font> Q. <$$font> You have not been examined before the Grand Jury ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.636

<font> A. <$$font> No . WATSON-1817-1,1,102.637

<font> Q. <$$font> When was it you were examined ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.638

<font> A. <$$font> On Saturday week , I believe .
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.639

<font> Q. <$$font> When were you first called on ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.640

<font> A. <$$font> About two days before I had a subpoena left me .
WATSON-1817-1,1,102.641

<font> Mr. Topping . <$$font> If your Lordship pleases we will have
the bills read ? WATSON-1817-1,1,102.642

<P_1,103>

<font> The following Bill was read . <$$font> WATSON-1817-1,1,103.644

{COM:bill_omitted}

<P_1,104>

<font> The Manuscript was read . <$$font> WATSON-1817-1,1,104.647

<font> Mr. Topping . <$$font> Now the large one .
WATSON-1817-1,1,104.648

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> I submit to your Lordship , that
the Counsel for the Prosecution are not in a situation , yet , to read
the large one , WATSON-1817-1,1,104.649

he has not yet given any account of the manuscript ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,104.650

he can@ @not say whether it was delivered to the party or not .
WATSON-1817-1,1,104.651

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> A great many of those were
carried away by Watson himself , WATSON-1817-1,1,104.652

therefore , whether there is any manuscript or not , does not signify .
WATSON-1817-1,1,104.653

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> My Lord , I submit , that is not
sufficient , WATSON-1817-1,1,104.654

we have had no notice to produce the manuscript of this .
WATSON-1817-1,1,104.655

<font> Mr. Topping . <$$font> Do you mean to say you do not know what
became of the manuscript from which the last was printed ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,104.656

<font> A. <$$font> I think it was given to one of the persons who came
for the first bills , to see whether the copy was right ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,104.657

there were 500 given at one time , in the first instance ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,104.658

and I am pretty sure the copy was given with them .
WATSON-1817-1,1,104.659

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Do you offer it now then ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,104.660

<font> Mr. {TEXT:Mr} Gurney . <$$font> At a future time , my Lord , we
will offer it . WATSON-1817-1,1,104.661

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Are not they all made originals ,
when Watson took away some of them ? WATSON-1817-1,1,104.662

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> I should think , my Lord , when Watson
took away so many of them , that that made them alike originals ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,104.663

but , when we can prove the fact it is not worth while to be arguing
points . WATSON-1817-1,1,104.664

<heading>

<font> John Crisp , sworn . <$$font> WATSON-1817-1,1,104.666

<$$heading>

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> My Lord , I object to this witness
being examined , and that , on the ground that he purports to be a
witness , whose description in the printed list delivered under the
Statute of King William , stands thus , " John Crisp , lately abiding at
No. 3 . Tyler's Court , Wardour Street , in the county of Middlesex ,
Grocer . " WATSON-1817-1,1,104.668

My Lord , the objection <P_1,105> I make is this , that the Statute of 7
Ann , cap. 21 . sec. 11. requires , " that when any person is
indicted for High Treason , a list of the witnesses who shall be
produced on the trial for proving the said indictment , - of the Jury ,
mentioning the names , professions , and place of abode , of the said
witnesses and Jurors , shall be given at the same time that the copy of
the indictment is delivered to the party indicted , and that copies of
all Indictments for the offence aforesaid , with such lists , shall be
delivered to the party indicted , ten days before the trial . "
WATSON-1817-1,1,105.669

Your Lordship will see , therefore , that the exigency of this clause
requires the names , professions , and places of abode of the witnesses
to be described . WATSON-1817-1,1,105.670

Now , the description of the witness , as it stands in this list <paren>
for I can see only one person of the name of Crisp , consequently there
can be no doubt that he is the person designated , <$$paren> is " John
Crisp , lately abiding at No. 3 . Tyler's Court , Wardour Street , in
the county of Middlesex , Grocer . " WATSON-1817-1,1,105.671

Here is , therefore , no description of the place of his residence .
WATSON-1817-1,1,105.672

Your Lordships will perceive , that the terms of the Statute of Queen
Anne , have not been at all complied with , in not stating his residence
, WATSON-1817-1,1,105.673

but without entering into the question , how far any substitution of
description would answer , I say there is no such substitution of the
actual description as would answer the purpose of description .
WATSON-1817-1,1,105.674

The term is <font> lately <$$font> abiding at , -
WATSON-1817-1,1,105.675

now that is no definite description of time , WATSON-1817-1,1,105.676

- it may be two months , or a year , WATSON-1817-1,1,105.677

one can hardly , in common language , or in law , give a definition to
the terms lately abiding at , WATSON-1817-1,1,105.678

- they must depend alone on the ideas of the person using that
description . WATSON-1817-1,1,105.679

Your Lordships will give me leave to state , that I conceive this is not
merely a question , turning on a matter of form ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,105.680

- if it were , it would be equally of force , where the law has required
it , just as if a bill of indictment were delivered nine days instead of
ten ; WATSON-1817-1,1,105.681

but when this objection is examined , it is not a mere objection of form
, WATSON-1817-1,1,105.682

but it is an objection <P_1,106> turning upon the non-compliance with
the requisites of this Statute , a failure and breach of which throw
into danger the fairness of every trial for High Treason ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,106.683

for the object of the Statute of Queen Anne , in requiring an identical
description of the witness , and his residence was , that that may
operate as a notice to the person accused , that he may make all the
enquiries which he may conceive conducive to his defence ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,106.684

but if you do not give the person's residence , he can@ @not use those
means of enquiry , which it was the peculiar object of this Statute to
give to him , WATSON-1817-1,1,106.685

and I apprehend , the more that circumstance is considered , the higher
will appear to be the value of this objection to the witness ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,106.686

- if a witness is described as lately living at such a place , it is
impossible for the person accused to make those enquiries which the
Statute meant he should , as to the person to be examined respecting the
matters , to which he is likely to be called in prosecuting the enquiry
, - what the person is - what he is supposed to know - what his
character is , and all those matters directly or indirectly , remotely ,
or nearly affecting the defence . WATSON-1817-1,1,106.687

Your lordship will allow me to press the objection further .
WATSON-1817-1,1,106.688

If this is a competent description for one witness , it is a competent
description of all the witnesses ; WATSON-1817-1,1,106.689

and the 250 witnesses in this list , may be all described , not with
their actual places of residence , or where they may be found , but
under this mysterious , uncertain , as I may express it , anonymous
place of residence . WATSON-1817-1,1,106.690

All may be left in darkness , with respect to the means the prisoner has
of searching them out . WATSON-1817-1,1,106.691

Under these circumstances , I would place this in two ways -
WATSON-1817-1,1,106.692

if it was merely a matter of form , I would submit that he can@ @not be
examined ; WATSON-1817-1,1,106.693

but , secondly I submit it is not a question of form , but turning upon
the substance of the defence , that the prisoner is debarred and shut
out of the very species of defence which the law gives him by the want
of description . WATSON-1817-1,1,106.694

<P_1,107>

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> When it is said <font> lately ,
<$$font> that must be with reference to the time when the list was
delivered ; WATSON-1817-1,1,107.696

now in all sort of reason it must be almost always in its nature lately
, unless the person delivering the list is actually at the place at the
time ; WATSON-1817-1,1,107.697

- the place of abode expressed must in sense and reason be that which it
has been lately , WATSON-1817-1,1,107.698

but that must be made to appear , WATSON-1817-1,1,107.699

therefore it will be proper to enquire , as a matter of fact , when he
was resident there . WATSON-1817-1,1,107.700

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> Did you lately , before the month of May
, reside in Tyler's Court , Wardour Street ? WATSON-1817-1,1,107.704

<font> A. <$$font> I did . WATSON-1817-1,1,107.705

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> When was the list delivered ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,107.706

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> On the 5th of May . {TEXT:?}
WATSON-1817-1,1,107.707

How long before the 5th of May did you quit that residence ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,107.708

<font> A. <$$font> About three months previous .
WATSON-1817-1,1,107.709

<font> Q. <$$font> Had your affairs been embarrassed ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,107.710

<font> A. <$$font> They were rather so , which induced me to leave .
{TEXT:?} WATSON-1817-1,1,107.711

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you at the time keeping out of the way , on
account of any difficulties you were in ? WATSON-1817-1,1,107.712

<font> A. <$$font> Not any pecuniary difficulties immediately ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,107.713

but I considered it a matter of convenience to shift my residence at
that time . WATSON-1817-1,1,107.714

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> He has not mentioned the number .
WATSON-1817-1,1,107.715

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> What number was it you lived at ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,107.716

<font> A. <$$font> No. 3 . WATSON-1817-1,1,107.717

<font> Q. <$$font> Was it a grocer's shop ? WATSON-1817-1,1,107.718

<font> A. <$$font> I did not carry on any business at that place ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,107.719

that was my private residence , WATSON-1817-1,1,107.720

but that has been my business through life . WATSON-1817-1,1,107.721

<font> Q. <$$font> How long had you resided there ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,107.722

<font> A. <$$font> It might be between three and four months , or
longer than that , a short time longer , WATSON-1817-1,1,107.723

I can@ @not speak to any fact immediately impressing it upon my
recollection . WATSON-1817-1,1,107.724

<P_1,108>

<font> Q. <$$font> After you had quitted that place were you discovered
by the Solicitor for the Treasury , till after the 5th of May , until
after you had seen your name printed in the list in the newspapers ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,108.726

<font> A. <$$font> It is within this month I received a subpoena in
consequence of having seen my name in the paper ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,108.727

and having heard that there were officers looking after me , I deemed it
advisable to go to Bow-Street , and give my name and residence .
WATSON-1817-1,1,108.728

<font> Q. <$$font> Was that after the 5th of May ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,108.729

<font> A. <$$font> Yes it was . {TEXT:?} WATSON-1817-1,1,108.730

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you mean after your name was published in the
newspaper as a witness ? WATSON-1817-1,1,108.731

<font> A. <$$font> Yes it was , WATSON-1817-1,1,108.732

that was the first I knew of the present proceedings , and my being a
witness . WATSON-1817-1,1,108.733

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> You say you have resided at this
place about three months . WATSON-1817-1,1,108.734

<font> A. <$$font> Rather more than that . WATSON-1817-1,1,108.735

<font> Q. <$$font> And that in point of fact you had left it three
months before the 5th of May ? WATSON-1817-1,1,108.736

<font> A. <$$font> No , not so long as that . WATSON-1817-1,1,108.737

<font> Q. <$$font> You told my learned friend , you had quitted this
place three months before the 5th of May . WATSON-1817-1,1,108.738

<font> A. <$$font> I must beg not to be understood to confine myself to
a particular week . WATSON-1817-1,1,108.739

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> I did not understand whether it
was three months before the 5th of May , or three months from the
present time ? WATSON-1817-1,1,108.740

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> I understood three months
previous to the 5th of May . WATSON-1817-1,1,108.741

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I believe it was so . WATSON-1817-1,1,108.742

<font> Q. <$$font> Will you have the goodness to tell us where you did
reside in the early part of May , - where you had lived for a month
before that ? WATSON-1817-1,1,108.743

<font> A. <$$font> I took a lodging at Blackwall .
WATSON-1817-1,1,108.744

<P_1,109>

<font> Q. <$$font> You went there from your house in Tyler's Court ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,109.746

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.747

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you reside there from the time of your leaving
Tyler's Court ? WATSON-1817-1,1,109.748

<font> A. <$$font> I remained there about a month , I should think , or
not longer than that ; WATSON-1817-1,1,109.749

it was at Mill Wall . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.750

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you residing there on the 5th of May ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,109.751

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say , really ; WATSON-1817-1,1,109.752

it is a matter I have never thought seriously about .
WATSON-1817-1,1,109.753

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> You can answer whether you
removed from Tyler's Court there ? WATSON-1817-1,1,109.754

<font> A. <$$font> I remained there about a month ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,109.755

and then I removed to where I am now . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.756

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> Where is that ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,109.757

<font> A. <$$font> At Chelsea . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.758

<font> Q. <$$font> You went from Tyler's Court to Mill Wall ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,109.759

and resided there till you removed to Chelsea ? WATSON-1817-1,1,109.760

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.761

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you ever carry on the business of a Grocer , in
Tyler's Court ? WATSON-1817-1,1,109.762

<font> A. <$$font> Never ; WATSON-1817-1,1,109.763

I answered his Lordship that just now . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.764

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> Where did you go to from Tyler's Court ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,109.765

<font> A. <$$font> To Mill Wall . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.766

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Grocer is your business and
profession , but not one you carried on there ? WATSON-1817-1,1,109.767

<font> A. <$$font> Just so . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.768

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> Was it known in Tyler's Court ,
where you were gone to ? WATSON-1817-1,1,109.769

<font> A. <$$font> No . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.770

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you leave word ? WATSON-1817-1,1,109.771

<font> A. <$$font> I did not . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.772

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> How long did you stay at Blackwall ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,109.773

<font> A. <$$font> About a month . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.774

<font> Q. <$$font> Where did you go from thence ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,109.775

<font> A. <$$font> To Chelsea . WATSON-1817-1,1,109.776

<P_1,110>

<font> Q. <$$font> Coming across London to Chelsea ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,110.778

<font> A. <$$font> I will recollect myself for a moment ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,110.779

there was a short time , about a fortnight or three weeks intervened ,
that I was at Ratcliffe Highway , WATSON-1817-1,1,110.780

and then I went to Chelsea ; WATSON-1817-1,1,110.781

I have been six or seven weeks at Chelsea . WATSON-1817-1,1,110.782

<font> Q. <$$font> Then about the 5th of May you went to Chelsea , I
suppose ? WATSON-1817-1,1,110.783

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> No , your inference is quite
incorrect , WATSON-1817-1,1,110.784

he must have been at Chelsea before the 5th of May . {TEXT:?}
WATSON-1817-1,1,110.785

<font> A. <$$font> No . WATSON-1817-1,1,110.786

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> How long have you been at Chelsea ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,110.787

<font> A. <$$font> Six weeks ; WATSON-1817-1,1,110.788

I was absent from Chelsea a short time , a short distance in the country
, WATSON-1817-1,1,110.789

but that is where I have resided for the last two months nearly .
WATSON-1817-1,1,110.790

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> Were you a lodger there ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,110.791

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . WATSON-1817-1,1,110.792

<font> Q. <$$font> And you had come from Ratcliffe Highway there ;
having gone to Ratcliffe Highway from Poplar , and from Tyler's Court to
Poplar ? WATSON-1817-1,1,110.793

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . WATSON-1817-1,1,110.794

<font> Q. <$$font> You did not leave word where you went to , when you
left Tyler's Court ? WATSON-1817-1,1,110.795

<font> A. <$$font> No , it would not have answered the purpose if I had
. WATSON-1817-1,1,110.796

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Was Tyler's Court the last
ostensible place where you were known ? WATSON-1817-1,1,110.797

<font> A. <$$font> I never have concealed myself ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,110.798

but I did not wish it should be known where I went to .
WATSON-1817-1,1,110.799

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> I do not ask whether you locked
yourself up , WATSON-1817-1,1,110.800

but you did not state where you were going to ? WATSON-1817-1,1,110.801

<font> A. <$$font> I did not . WATSON-1817-1,1,110.802

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> I submit to your Lordship , on
the account the witness has given , it is clear he can@ @not be examined
; WATSON-1817-1,1,110.803

I am quite sure that your Lordship will be of opinion , that this is not
a formal objection ; WATSON-1817-1,1,110.804

the provisions <P_1,111> of the Statute of Anne , were considered as
necessary provisions to protect a party standing in the situation of the
prisoner ; WATSON-1817-1,1,111.805

your Lordship sees how anxious the Legislature is , that every possible
information should be given to the prisoner , in order that he might
make all necessary enquiries with regards to the witness , not only as
to his past conduct - WATSON-1817-1,1,111.806

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Do you give any further account of
his residence ? WATSON-1817-1,1,111.807

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> The case must certainly stand ,
with respect to this witness , as it does at present .
WATSON-1817-1,1,111.808

We enquired at this place , Tyler-court , where it is said he is lately
abiding ; WATSON-1817-1,1,111.809

but not getting any information there , we have not enquired at any
other place . WATSON-1817-1,1,111.810

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Do you give any evidence of any
enquiries carried on , in order to give the most perfect information you
could , as to the place of his residence ? WATSON-1817-1,1,111.811

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> My Lord , I have no evidence
upon that subject , WATSON-1817-1,1,111.812

therefore if your Lordships think that this is not within the provisions
of the statute , I would not press his examination .
WATSON-1817-1,1,111.813

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> You have no evidence of any
enquiries made respecting his place of abode ? WATSON-1817-1,1,111.814

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> No , I have not , my Lord .
WATSON-1817-1,1,111.815

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Then it does appear , that that was
not the latest place of residence ; WATSON-1817-1,1,111.816

and as it does not appear that any endeavour has been made to find him
out , after he ceased to reside there , we think he can@ @not be
examined . WATSON-1817-1,1,111.817

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> Will you look whether you see among those
persons any of those you took in that coach ? WATSON-1817-1,1,112.841

<font> A. <$$font> No , neither one of those . WATSON-1817-1,1,112.842

<font> Q. <$$font> What part of Spa-Fields did you go to ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,112.843

<font> A. <$$font> Into the middle of Spa-Fields .
WATSON-1817-1,1,112.844

WATSON-1817-1,1,112.845

<font> A. <$$font> Yes ; WATSON-1817-1,1,112.846

I stopped before I got to the Merlin's Cave . WATSON-1817-1,1,112.847

<font> Q. <$$font> Did either of the persons who went with you , have
any stick or wand ? WATSON-1817-1,1,112.848

<font> A. <$$font> No ; the man who went on the box had a wand .
WATSON-1817-1,1,112.849

<font> Q. <$$font> When you arrived in Spa-Fields , was any thing done
with that wand ? WATSON-1817-1,1,112.850

<font> A. <$$font> No , not at first . WATSON-1817-1,1,112.851

<font> Q. <$$font> No matter , whether at first or at last .
WATSON-1817-1,1,112.852

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Unless you call Hunt , and prove

you mean to say that they were driven to procure a waggon , by being
refused the use of this house , I suppose . WATSON-1817-1,1,119.1051

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Yes , my Lord ,

during the trial . WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1277

The court of course must animadvert upon it if it is done .

<font> Mr. Vincent George Dowling sworn . WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1280

Examined by Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1281

<$$heading>

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you at the meeting that took place at Spa
Fields on the 15th of November last ? WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1283

<font> A. <$$font> I was . WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1284

<font> Q. <$$font> Where were you , in the Fields , or in the Merlin's
Cave ? WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1285

<font> A. <$$font> In the crowd , in front of the Merlin's Cave .
WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1286

<font> Q. <$$font> In the Field ? WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1287

<font> A. <$$font> In the Field . WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1288

<font> Q. <$$font> Were there a large number of persons there ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1289

<font> A. <$$font> A very great number . WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1290

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you hear Mr. Hunt address the populace ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1291

<font> A. <$$font> I did . WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1292

<font> Q. <$$font> From what place ? WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1293

<font> A. <$$font> From the window of the Merlin's Cave public-house .
WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1294

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see any flag at that meeting ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1295

<font> A. <$$font> I did . WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1296

<font> Q. <$$font> Where was that displayed ? WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1297

<font> A. <$$font> From the window of the Merlin's Cave public-house .
WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1298

<font> Q. <$$font> What sort of a flag was it ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,127.1299

<P_1,128>

<font> A. <$$font> It was a tri-coloured flag , green , white , and red
. WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1301

<font> Q. <$$font> Was there any inscription upon it ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1302

<font> A. <$$font> There was . WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1303

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect what it was ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1304

<font> A. <$$font> I do not recollect the express terms ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1305

but there was some reference to Justice , Humanity , and Truth .
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1306

I can@ @not recollect the precise words , WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1307

I should recollect them if I saw them , WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1308

and could identify the flag . WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1309

<font> Q. <$$font> Was any day proposed to Mr. Hunt , as a day to
which the meeting should adjourn ? WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1310

<font> A. <$$font> Mr. Hunt proposed the first day of the meeting of
Parliament . WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1311

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you hear any body , WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1312

and if you did , who was it proposed any amendment to that ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1313

<font> A. <$$font> The younger Mr. Watson first proposed , it should
take place that day fortnight , but subsequently that it should take
place the Monday fortnight , which would be the 2nd of December .
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1314

<font> Q. <$$font> How long did they stay there ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1315

<font> A. <$$font> From the first to the last .
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1316

<font> Q. <$$font> Yes ? WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1317

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not justly call to my recollection ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1318

but from 1 o'clock to about 5 , to the best of my recollection .
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1319

<font> Q. <$$font> You left Spa Fields when the other persons did ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1320

did you afterwards attend the meeting on the 2nd of December ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1321

<font> A. <$$font> I did . WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1322

<font> Q. <$$font> Had you seen any advertisements or placards stuck up
, advertising that second meeting ? WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1323

<font> A. <$$font> I had . WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1324

<font> Q. <$$font> Will you have the goodness to look at that ? <font>
<paren> Handing a placard to the witness . <$$paren> <$$font>
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1325

<font> A. <$$font> That I believe to be a copy of the placard to which
I allude , and which I saw on the walls , antecedent to the meeting .
WATSON-1817-1,1,128.1326

<P_1,129>

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Is this the one that was produced
by Seale ? WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1328

<font> Mr. Solicitor_General . <$$font> Yes , my Lord .
WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1329

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> I take it for granted , this thing
will be brought home to the prisoner . WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1330

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> The contents of the large and of
the small paper were stated to be the same . WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1331

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> No , my Lord , they are very different
. WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1332

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> The contents appear to be the same
. WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1333

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> I took an objection ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1334

and the ground of my objection was , that we had not had notice to
produce what Watson took away . WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1335

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> We shall wait till they have
completed their proof as to that paper . WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1336

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> It went off as Crisp was called
. WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1337

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> I apprehend , with great
deference to your Lordship , we are now in a situation to read that
paper . WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1338

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> I think the printer stated , that
he printed several hundred of them , specifying the contents , and that
Watson took away five_and_twenty of them . WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1339

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> I allude to the large bills ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1340

it is proved the small ones were taken away , WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1341

but we have no identification of the contents of the large one .
WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1342

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> He stated that the contents of
all were the same , and twenty-five of the large ones were taken away by
Watson . WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1343

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Yes , my Lord ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1344

but who brought the paper to be printed , is not proved .
WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1345

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> If they are all originals , you
may read any one of them , as well as the one carried away by Watson .
WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1346

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> We have had no notice of the contents
of the paper . WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1347

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> These were printed from a
manuscript . WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1348

My learned friends were not able to give any account of this manuscript
, WATSON-1817-1,1,129.1349

therefore we contended they could not read <P_1,130> this copy of it .
WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1350

It was said Watson had taken some copies away ; WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1351

that was said in order to satisfy the court ; WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1352

but to let in this duplicate , I submit , Watson should have had notice
to produce it . WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1353

Your Lordship recollects a case , where there was a copy of a letter
taken off by a machine , which would necessarily be a true copy ,
offered in evidence , WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1354

but it was held , the party there must have notice to produce the
original letter ; WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1355

our objection is , that the manuscript is not properly traced , or
proved to be lost , and that it ought to be produced , or some account
given of it . WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1356

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> He takes away twenty-five copies of
one uniform impression , by which , he having come with Preston ,
recognizes them as having been printed under their orders .
WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1357

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> It does not appear that he came
with Preston at that meeting . WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1358

Castle ordered that paper . WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1359

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Castle brought it with an order to
print five_hundred copies ; WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1360

Watson fetched away several , about twenty-five ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1361

then he adopts that , as done in the execution of some order he has
given ; WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1362

and when he takes twenty-five or thirty out of a common impression ,
they must be supposed all to agree in the contents .
WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1363

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> Your objection at one time was ,
that we could not receive this , because this is not the very document
which was in the possession of Watson , and that Watson ought to have
had notice in order to produce those twenty-five copies which he had
carried away , and that until he had received that notice , any other
evidence of the contents was secondary evidence .
WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1364

Now it seems to me , that that is not the case , for that every one of
those which are worked off are originals in the nature and character of
duplicate originals , with respect to which it is clear , you are at
liberty to give one duplicate in evidence without giving notice to
produce the others . WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1365

There is another ground on which this would be made evidence .
WATSON-1817-1,1,130.1366

<P_1,131>

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> In the first place , the
original manuscript was left with the printer , WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1368

he gave no account of that , WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1369

and we say , these are copies of that original manuscript ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1370

therefore being copies , and giving no account of the loss of the
manuscript , he can@ @not shew they corresponded with the original .
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1371

Then in the next place it is said , these are all duplicate originals ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1372

but in fact they are duplicate copies , WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1373

and it by no means follows they are all alike because they are printed ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1374

it by no means follows , in point of law or in point of fact ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1375

and therefore I submit they can@ @not give them in evidence , unless we
have notice to produce that parcel we took away ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1376

and if we withheld it , they might then shew it corresponded with those
now produced ; WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1377

but that can@ @not be done in the first instance , without giving us
notice to produce what we took away , they all being copies of one
original , WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1378

and I apprehend the rule of law is not varied by the use of machinery .
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1379

According to the case of the letter copied by a machine there , there
could be no mistake ; WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1380

but my Lord Ellenborough decided that did not vary the course of the law
as to originals and copies ; WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1381

if they had given us notice to produce the one we took away , they might
show this corresponded with that . WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1382

My learned friends felt the force of the objection ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1383

and they endeavoured to supply it , because they called Crisp to supply
it . WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1384

Your lordships rejected his evidence , WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1385

and therefore , my learned friends admit they feel weight of it ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1386

and I submit this paper can@ @not be read . WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1387

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> It is clear this is not produced
in evidence to shew the contents of the manuscript ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1388

if it was , there would be considerable weight in the objection ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1389

but all these become originals , WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1390

and the manuscript is thrown off and discharged :
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1391

it is in evidence , that they are all from the same press ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1392

and therefore they must be the same . WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1393

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> The object of calling the witness
first , was to bring the manuscript home to one of the conspirators .
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1394

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> In that they failed .
WATSON-1817-1,1,131.1395

<P_1,132>

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Then , my Lord , do not they fail
<font> in_toto <$$font> as to the use of it , because a placard can only
be used as to the matter contained in it ; WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1397

the entire drift of producing the placard is , to shew it contained
improper matter . WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1398

My Lord , when I first took the objection , the witness said a person of
the name of Castle brought the manuscript to be printed ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1399

I said this must go for nothing . WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1400

I then understood it was put in conditionally , in order that the
manuscript sent to the printer , might be brought home to the Prisoner
at the Bar ; WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1401

and the Lord_Chief_Justice said , unless it were brought home , it was
only an act done by Castle . WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1402

The question is , how is the act advanced against the Prisoner ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1403

It is produced to shew it contained treasonable and seditious matters ,
or some other matters promotive of the matters charged in the Indictment
; WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1404

the prosecutor can@ @not say he does not produce it for relevant
purposes ; WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1405

the matter charged is matter of treason and sedition ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1406

and the placard , it is stated , was calculated to promote those objects
: WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1407

the manuscript is brought home to none of the prisoners ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1408

- no copy of it is verified by the prisoners , WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1409

but something which is not identified as a copy of the manuscript is put
in : - for what ? WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1410

for no purpose but to be read ; WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1411

and I say they can@ @not produce it for the circumstance of the date ,
or any other circumstance whatever WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1412

but it is produced to shew the matter it contains , - that it contains
matter promotive of the objects charged in the Indictment ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1413

and therefore it resolves itself into this circumstance ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1414

here is an improved copy of an alleged original , not brought home to
anybody . WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1415

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> Do you propose to offer any thing
further , Brother Copley ? WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1416

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> No , my Lord .
WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1417

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> I am of opinion this is to be
read in evidence now . WATSON-1817-1,1,132.1418

If it were offered , in order to shew the contents of the manuscript
supposed to have been originally <P_1,133> delivered to the printer , it
might be contended , perhaps , that sufficient evidence had not been
given to let it in ; WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1419

but there is another view in which it seems to me sufficient has been
done to allow this paper to be read : WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1420

here is a meeting held at Spa Fields on the 2nd of December , at which
it has been opened , and I suppose it will be proved , that Watson , and
some other persons connected with him in this Indictment , were present
; WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1421

then in order to shew that Mr. Watson who was present at the meeting ,
knew the contents of a placard that had been posted about this town ,
relating to the meeting , and giving notice of it , this fact is proved
, that the printer having from his own head , if you please , printed a
large number of papers exactly like that produced , delivered
twenty-five of them into the hands of Watson , and that that took place
on the 28th of November , four days previous to this meeting .
WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1422

Does not that shew that Watson knew the contents of this paper which was
placarded about the streets , relating to that meeting , at which I
understand he afterwards attended ; WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1423

if he had knowledge of the contents of the paper , it is evidence
against him . WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1424

<font> Mr. Justice Holroyd . <$$font> I am of the same opinion .
WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1425

It is not a question of copy and original ; WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1426

whether a number of papers being printed from a manuscript , were
agreeable to the manuscript , is not the question before the Court ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1427

but they were printed by the orders of two persons who came to the
printer , WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1428

and the prisoner took twenty-five copies away , WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1429

that circumstance shews , there must have been an order given for these
things , a part of which he comes and gets , WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1430

- none of them are originals more than the others , - not those taken
away more than those left behind , WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1431

and the question is , whether this is sufficient proof that the Prisoner
at the Bar took away part of the impression which was printed , and
whether that may be proved in the way proposed ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1432

- it goes to shew his knowledge of the contents of these things ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,133.1433

<P_1,134>

and I am of opinion , for the reason I have given , that this paper may
now be read . WATSON-1817-1,1,134.1435

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> To prove notice of the contents of
a newspaper , you prove , that the man had a copy of the paper ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,134.1436

and you prove , by another , the contents , WATSON-1817-1,1,134.1437

- it is of perpetual occurrence . WATSON-1817-1,1,134.1438

<font> The Placard was read as follows : <$$font>
WATSON-1817-1,1,134.1439

{COM:contents_of_placard_omitted}

<P_1,135>

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> You have already said , you had
seen placards like this stuck upon the walls in different parts of the
town ? WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1442

<font> A. <$$font> I had . WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1443

<font> Q. <$$font> You went to the meeting on the 2d of December ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1444

<font> A. <$$font> I did . WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1445

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you observe whether many people assembled there
? WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1446

<font> A. <$$font> There were a considerable number .
WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1447

<font> Q. <$$font> At what time of the day did you go there ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1448

<font> A. <$$font> I went there about eleven o'clock .
WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1449

<font> Q. <$$font> In the morning ? WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1450

<font> A. <$$font> In the forenoon . WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1451

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you observe any waggon drawn into the Field ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1452

<font> A. <$$font> On my arrival in the Field I went to the Merlin's
Cave , where I understood the meeting was to take place ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1453

I ascended into the room , where the former meeting took place ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1454

and I perceived from the window a crowd assembling at that end of the
Field next Cold-Bath Fields' Prison , WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1455

in consequence of that observation , I proceeded from the Merlin's Cave
to the spot where I saw the crowd assembling ; WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1456

on my arrival there I observed several persons , some of whom bore flags
, WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1457

one of them I recognized to be the same flag , which I had previously
seen on the 15th , exhibited from the Merlin's Cave window ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1458

the second flag was of a smaller description - WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1459

it was tri-coloured , and bearing the same colours with the larger one ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1460

there was a third man , bearing a banner , a large square frame , and a
piece of white cloth , on which was inscribed the words - " The brave
Soldiers are our Friends , WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1461

treat them kindly . " WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1462

To the best of my recollection those were the words upon the placard :
WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1463

some of the persons assembled wore tri-coloured cockades , corresponding
in colours with the flags which I have already alluded to .
WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1464

The centre of attraction seemed to be a waggon , which I then perceived
for the first time ; WATSON-1817-1,1,135.1465

into this a great number <P_1,136> of persons ascended -
WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1466

there was considerable confusion ; WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1467

but after a little lapse of time I observed the prisoner Watson mount
upon the edge of the waggon , and wave his hand , as if to intreat
silence . WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1468

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see any other persons in the waggon , whom
you knew , or whom you recognized ? WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1469

<font> A. {TEXT:A,} <$$font> I saw Mr. Hooper ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1470

and I saw young Watson ; WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1471

Mr. Preston I saw subsequently - WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1472

the elder Mr. Watson , the younger Mr. Watson , and Mr. Hooper .
WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1473

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> You said , I think , that you saw
Mr. Preston ? WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1474

<font> A. <$$font> I did not see him till subsequent to the speech ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1475

he was then either ascending or descending , WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1476

I could not tell which - WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1477

he was elevated rather above the crowd : WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1478

the elder Watson waved his hand , as if to intreat silence from the
crowd around him , which was considerable . WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1479

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you near enough to hear whether he did address
the crowd ? WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1480

<font> A. <$$font> I was quite near enough ; WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1481

in fact , I was within , I suppose , ten yards of the waggon .
WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1482

<font> Q. <$$font> Can you repeat to my Lord and the Jury , what he
said , or any part of what he said , with perfect recollection .
WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1483

<font> A. <$$font> I took a short-hand note . WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1484

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> I do not wish to occupy your
Lordships' time improperly , WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1485

but this is a point of considerable importance - whether a speech , of
which a person has a short-hand note , ought not to have been set out as
an overt act in the Indictment ? WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1486

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> This is the evidence of the overt
act . WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1487

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> I object , my Lord , that they have
not stated the substance of the speeches , WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1488

they only allege that there were speeches . WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1489

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Did you ever know a statement of
all that was said - WATSON-1817-1,1,136.1490

has there ever been an instance in all time of a trial for High Treason
, in which they have not <P_1,137> charged them under generalities , "
divers speeches , " and so on , WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1491

and has there ever occurred an instance , in which a speech or a
consultation was stated in its words . WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1492

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> You will recollect , in the Case
of The King <font> v. <$$font> Francis , as far as I recollect , one of
the charges was , that he wrote divers letters ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1493

and the objection was , that the contents of those letters were none of
them stated ; WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1494

and the decision was , that they need not be . WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1495

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> Your Lordship will allow me to
state , that in that Case , the object of the letter was stated , that
it was to invite the King of France to send Troops into this Country ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1496

and though the Indictment did not state the words , it stated the
substance of them ; WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1497

in all the Cases cited , the subject of the letter has been set out .
WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1498

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> The object ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1499

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> No , my Lord , the substance ;
to shew that letters were sent to the French King for the purpose of
inducing him to send troops to further particular objects which the
party had in view . WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1500

Will your Lordship allow me to refer to what is stated in Mr. East's
Book , as the effect of the cases , WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1501

it is in the margin . WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1502

" Upon an Indictment for compassing the King's death , in which a
treasonable declaration of the Prisoner was alleged as an overt act ,
but was only set forth in substance , it was objected in arrest of
judgment , that the words of the declaration were not specific ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1503

but the Court unanimously held the Indictment sufficient ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1504

it was laid {COM:sic} , that the declaration contained incitements ,
persuasions , and promises of reward , to induce the people to join in
rebellion , which was an overt act of the Treason charged , namely , the
compassing the King's death ; WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1505

and this being the substantial charge , it was sufficiently set forth in
the Cases of Coleman and Lord Preston , WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1506

the substance only and purport of the letters found upon them were set
forth : in Staley's Case , " which was in the reign of Charles the
Second , WATSON-1817-1,1,137.1507

I remember <P_1,138> particularly now that the words were set out ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1508

" {COM:sic} the words were spoken in French , WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1509

and the purport of them was stated in Latin : WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1510

in Francis's Case the like rule was laid down , that it is not necessary
to set forth the letters themselves of a treasonable correspondence ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1511

it is sufficient to state the substance and intent of them ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1512

for they are evidence of the secret compassing and imagination of the
heart : WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1513

in Dr. Drake's Case , it was said by Lord Holt , that either the very
words of a libel might be charged , but then the smallest variation
which changed the word was fatal , or the substance and effect of it may
be stated , and in that case , if the sense be rightly stated , it is
sufficient : " WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1514

now your Lordship sees , by adverting to this record , that the
substance of these words , and these speeches , is not stated upon the
record , but in general terms , that he made seditious inflammatory
speeches ; WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1515

the Indictment does not profess to give the substance of any of those
speeches , WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1516

but the object of them is stated , WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1517

and I think I can undertake to say , there is not a single instance to
be found anywhere , where in an overt act of Treason -
WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1518

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Was there any instance in the
Trials of Hardy or Horne Tooke , in which the letters or speeches were
set out ? WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1519

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> No , my Lord , there was not .
WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1520

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> The speeches there are not alleged as
the Treason . WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1521

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> There were speeches and writings
? WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1522

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> Yes , my Lord , and letters ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1523

and Paine's Rights of Man were given in evidence .
WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1524

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Your Lordship will perceive that this
point occurs on a Treason assigned for the first time under the Statute
of the 36th of the King , under which there has been no Indictment ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1525

for in Despard's case , I believe , this Treason was not inserted in
that Indictment . WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1526

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> Yes , it was . WATSON-1817-1,1,138.1527

<P_1,139>

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Under that act it is made Treason to
conspire to levy war to force and compel the King to change his measures
. WATSON-1817-1,1,139.1529

Now with reference to that count it is material we should know , what
this speech was , in order to know what those measures of the King were
, which the conspirators proposed to compel the King to change ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,139.1530

and it is introduced as one of the main overt acts of the whole .
WATSON-1817-1,1,139.1531

Your lordship will observe , there are three or four overt acts charged
; the one hiring waggons , the next procuring waggons ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,139.1532

the next is procuring the platforms on which the speeches were made ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,139.1533

- the question then is , where the Treason alleged is conspiring to
overturn the government , for one count is for a conspiracy to depose
the king , in other words , to overturn the government ; another for a
conspiracy to compel the King to change his measures , whether the mode
, being a speech made , it is not necessary to set out , if not the
words , the substance of the speech at least - that the mob called on
the King to equalize the distribution of property - that the mob called
on the King to give a certain sum among the poor - or that the mob
called on the King to give a reform in Parliament ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,139.1534

and I am the more satisfied in my humble conception , that it is
necessary within the Statute of King William because , where the Treason
alleged is to compel the King to change his measures , how can we know
whether that speech is adapted to effect it without knowing what the
speech is to which it relates . WATSON-1817-1,1,139.1535

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Can there be any doubt that this is
evidence under the overt acts for levying war ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,139.1536

It is evidence <font> quo animo , <$$font> the thing was done .
WATSON-1817-1,1,139.1537

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Your lordship sees the puzzle which we
are in here . WATSON-1817-1,1,139.1538

There are four Treasons here alleged , the like of which were never seen
in the Crown Office before ; WATSON-1817-1,1,139.1539

if you can put four treasons into one record , it appears to me that the
requisitions of the statute of King William are not <P_1,140> very well
complied with . WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1540

However , having stated this point to your lordship generally , I can
only say , it does appear to me , with respect to many of the treasons
here , to be a question totally new , WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1541

and if the <font> corpus , <$$font> if I may so call it , of the treason
, consist in a speech made , which speech made is to bring about the
death of the King , which death of the King is to be carried into effect
by force ; within the meaning of the statute of King William , how can
the party know what the overt act charged upon him , is , unless the
substance of the speech is set out upon the record ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1542

<font> Mr. Serjeant Copley . <$$font> I do not know whether your
lordship will allow me to suggest , that I do not object to this as it
respects young Watson , that what I suggest is , with respect to the
elder Watson . WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1543

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> The substantive allegation there is ,
that Watson the younger leaped out of the waggon , and invited the
persons present to follow him . WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1544

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> I am perfectly convinced that in
all reasoning upon the subject it is sufficient .
WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1545

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> I am entirely of the same opinion
. WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1546

In the case of the King <font> v. <$$font> Francis , the court laid
down a rule very strongly applicable to this case .
WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1547

There the indictment stated as an overt act , " That the party did
traitorously compose and write , and caused to be composed and written ,
several traitorous letters , notifying the intentions and resolutions of
him the said Francis Francis , and the said other traitors , to move and
levy war , and requiring aid in the said war of the said foreigners and
other persons then in France , " and then stating that they caused these
letters to be sent . WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1548

Now the objection there was , that the letters themselves ought to have
been set forth , WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1549

but the court decided that it was not necessary ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1550

and they decided it for this reason , that the overt act is sufficiently
stated , WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1551

and then the contents of the letters are only evidence of what that
overt act is , WATSON-1817-1,1,140.1552

<P_1,141>

and if you set out the general nature of the overt act , it is also
necessary for you to state the medium of the proof by which it is to be
made out . WATSON-1817-1,1,141.1554

Here it appears to me , that there is a sufficient statement of the
overt act , that the party made seditious , and treasonable , and
inflammatory harangues , and the particular terms of those harangues are
evidence upon that overt act , WATSON-1817-1,1,141.1555

therefore it appears to me , that the case of the King <font> v.
<$$font> Francis , and other cases establish the principle under which
this is clearly admissible . WATSON-1817-1,1,141.1556

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> I am also of opinion , that the
overt act alluded to , is stated with sufficient certainty to allow the
Court to receive this evidence ; WATSON-1817-1,1,141.1557

it is laid with as much certainty as has been usual on any former
occasion , in relation to subjects of the same nature .
WATSON-1817-1,1,141.1558

In Hardy's Trial , there were " books , pamphlets , letters ,
instructions , resolutions , orders , declarations , addresses , and
writings , " stated to have been " composed , written , published ,
purporting , and containing therein , among other things , incitements ,
encouragement and exhortations , to move , induce , and persuade , the
King's subjects to chuse , depute , and send , and cause to be chosen ,
deputed , and sent , persons as delegates to compose and constitute a
convention . " WATSON-1817-1,1,141.1559

Here there is a charge , " that Watson , the elder , and Watson , the
younger , did make , and with loud voices , utter seditious ,
inflammatory , and treasonable speeches and harangues , meaning and
intending thereby , " - for the meaning and intending at the end of this
overt act applies to all the remainder , - " meaning and intending
thereby , to move , excite , cause , and procure the subjects of the
King , so there then being to raise , make , and levy insurrection ,
rebellion and war against the King . " WATSON-1817-1,1,141.1560

The overt act is sufficiently certain , WATSON-1817-1,1,141.1561

but if there were no such overt act in this indictment , I should still
be of opinion , that what the prisoner has himself said with reference
to the transaction then passing and going on , and in the course and
progress of that transaction , must be evidence <P_1,142> received , as
explanatory of those proceedings , and the part he was taking , so as to
shew that that insurrection and riot , that afterwards occurred , was of
such a particular nature , as to come within the clause of levying war .
WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1562

<font> Mr. Justice Holroyd . <$$font> I am of the same opinion .
WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1563

I think that the overt act is sufficiently stated , and the object of it
is stated , as well as the making speeches and harangues ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1564

it is stated by the words " meaning and intending by means of the
several premises aforesaid , to move , excite , cause and procure the
subjects of the King , so there then being to raise , make , and levy
insurrection , rebellion and war against the King within this realm ,
and to subvert and destroy the Constitution and Government of this realm
, as by law established . " WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1565

I do not see how this evidence could possibly be rejected , because
there are several other overt acts of consultations , and conspiring to
levy war to attack the Bank and Tower , and seduce the Soldiers ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1566

and in every count there is an overt act for levying war ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1567

and those speeches which are uttered by the defendant himself , go to
shew the very nature and object of the conspiracy ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1568

at least they are offered in evidence , as having that tendency ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1569

and it is impossible to reject them , WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1570

for they may shew the very nature of that conspiracy , and what the
people were to do in consequence of those proceedings .
WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1571

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> If there had been no overt act that
bears upon this , it is an universal rule of evidence , that what a
party himself says , may be given in evidence to explain his conduct ,
to which it bears any reference . WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1572

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> It is not in that way we put the
objection , that it is not evidence , but that it is not proof of the
overt act . WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1573

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> There is no occasion to discuss ,
that whatever comes from the mouth of man , may be evidence against that
man , to shew the intention with which he acts .
WATSON-1817-1,1,142.1574

<P_1,143>

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> There was no use in wasting
this half-hour , if my learned friends admit that it is evidence .
WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1576

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> I will waste an hour , if I think the
objection a good one . WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1577

<font> Mr. Attorney_General , <paren> to Mr. Dowling . <$$paren>
<$$font> You state that you took in short-hand the address of Mr.
Watson to the people ? WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1578

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you got your short-hand note here ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1580

<font> A. <$$font> I have . WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1581

<font> Q. <$$font> Be so good as to read to my Lords and the Jury what
it was he stated ? WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1582

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Pray , Mr. Short-hand Writer , when
did you take that note ? WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1583

<font> A. <$$font> I took it on the 2nd of December , in Spa Fields .
WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1584

<font> Q. <$$font> When did you copy it out ? WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1585

<font> A. <$$font> I copied it out the same evening . {TEXT:?}
WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1586

<font> Q. <$$font> Is that the copy you made that evening ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1587

<font> A. <$$font> No , it is not ; WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1588

this is the short-hand note I took , WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1589

and this is a literal copy ; WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1590

the short-hand note I took with a pencil , WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1591

and in the crowd , and perhaps having been taken six months back , it
may be somewhat defaced , WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1592

but I can read the short-hand note with a little difficulty , though
certainly I could read the transcript with more ease ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1593

I will read the short-hand note if it is wished .
WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1594

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> You made that transcript the same
evening ? WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1595

<font> A. <$$font> I made this transcript yesterday ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1596

I made another transcript the same evening . WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1597

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Be so good as to lend us the
transcript while you read it : WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1598

I shall shew the short-hand writer is mistaken in one word at least .
WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1599

<font> A. <$$font> It is very probable I may have been mistaken , from
the circumstances in which I was ; WATSON-1817-1,1,143.1600

I can only say , that the note was as correct as it could be under the
circumstances <P_1,144> under which it was taken .
WATSON-1817-1,1,144.1601

Mr. Watson himself spoke first : WATSON-1817-1,1,144.1602

" Friends and Countrymen , We are convened this day , in consequence of
a resolution passed at our last meeting , to hear the answer to the

I can@ @not refrain from expressing the pleasure which I feel at this
moment in addressing so respectable a meeting .
WATSON-1817-1,1,144.1604

The petition to which I allude , and which Mr. Hunt was deputed to
present to the Prince Regent , was prepared , in the hope that his Royal
Highness would give an answer to the cries of these starving thousands
by whom he was addressed . WATSON-1817-1,1,144.1605

I am sorry to inform you , however , that he has resolved to give us no

' England expects that every man will do his duty ; '

- While these miseries exist , how few enjoy splendid luxury ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,144.1613

only half a_million , as this placard expresses , are not either in fear
of embarrassment or in debt . WATSON-1817-1,1,144.1614

Under these circumstances I ask you , Friends and Countrymen , if the
Ministers have done their duty in advising the Prince Regent not to hear
our cries ? WATSON-1817-1,1,144.1615

<font> Q. <$$font> Which way did you go into the city ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1834

<font> A. <$$font> I passed by Mr. Beckwith's shop in Skinner Street ,
which I saw demolished . WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1835

<font> Q. <$$font> That is , before you come to Newgate Street ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1836

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1837

<font> Q. <$$font> Were there any part of the mob at Mr. Beckwith's at
that time . WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1838

<font> A. <$$font> There were not . WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1839

<font> Q. <$$font> In what state did it appear to be at that time ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1840

<font> A. <$$font> The windows appeared to be very much broken and
shattered ; WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1841

the shop appeared to be in a very dilapidated state ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1842

but the shutters were put up to hide the appearance of it as much as
possible . WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1843

<font> Q. <$$font> Where did you come up with the mob ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1844

<font> A. <$$font> In the Minories . WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1845

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see any person's house that was being
attacked , or had been attacked ? WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1846

<font> A. <$$font> The house of Messrs. Brander and Potts bore the
same appearance as Mr. Beckwith's , WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1847

and I saw also Mr. Rea's house , which was demolished in the same way .
WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1848

<font> Q. <$$font> What are Brander and Potts ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1849

<font> A. <$$font> They are Gunsmiths , WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1850

and Mr. Rea is a gunsmith . WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1851

They are on opposite sides of the same street ; WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1852

in the front of Mr. Rea's shop there were some pikes , and some long
guns , WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1853

I saw a very long gun , a duck gun , and some muskets and things of that
sort , pulled down and lying in front of the shop , outside the window .
WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1854

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you mean in the street , outside the shop ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1855

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , the windows of the shop itself were quite
demolished and destroyed . WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1856

<font> Q. <$$font> Had any of the mob arms at that time ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1857

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> He has not said that the mob were
there at that time , I think . WATSON-1817-1,1,152.1858

<P_1,153>

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> You did not see the mob at
those homes ? WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1860

<font> A. <$$font> No , the mischief had been done at that time ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1861

I met the mob coming up the Minories , I suppose three or four_hundred
of them , some of them armed with guns , some with pistols ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1862

some were charging their pieces , and others discharging them .
WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1863

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> Had you met them before you came
to Brander and Potts@ @'s house ? WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1864

<font> A. <$$font> Nearly opposite to Brander and Potts@ @'s house they
were armed with guns , pistols , cutlasses , dirks of various
descriptions , and also a small brass carronade , I believe it was .
WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1865

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Every word is belief .
WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1866

<font> A. <$$font> I am not a very good judge myself -
WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1867

to the best of my belief it was a carronade . WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1868

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> What do you mean by a carronade
? WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1869

<font> A. <$$font> A brass piece of ordnance on wheels , and drawn by
men . WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1870

<font> Q. <$$font> In whose possession was that ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1871

<font> A. <$$font> Of the crowd - WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1872

it was drawn by sailors ; WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1873

two sailors drew it in front , WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1874

and one , with a marling-spike , or a spike of some kind , guided it
behind . WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1875

<font> Q. <$$font> Were those who drew it part of the mob ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1876

<font> A. <$$font> They were persons of that description , riotously
inclined . WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1877

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> I think you said something about
their discharging their pieces ? WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1878

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , some were discharging their pieces in the air
, not to do mischief . WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1879

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> How long did you continue with
the mob ? WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1880

<font> A. <$$font> Till they were dispersed by the horse-guards .
WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1881

<font> Q. <$$font> How soon after that was it that the horse-guards
made their appearance ? WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1882

<font> A. <$$font> Perhaps ten minutes , or a quarter of an hour ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,153.1883

they <P_1,154> were marching up the Minories , WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1884

and I heard some of the people cry - " To Spa Fields . "
WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1885

<font> Q. <$$font> When you say marching up the Minories , do you mean
towards Spa Fields ? WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1886

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1887

<font> Q. <$$font> Then you heard some of them cry - " To Spa Fields ?
" WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1888

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I did . WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1889

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> This was after you had seen the
demolished state of the houses - WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1890

they were then returning ? WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1891

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , they were then returning after the mischief
had been done - WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1892

I was not present when the demolition was made .
WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1893

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> Did you go back to Spa Fields ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1894

<font> A. <$$font> I did after the mob had been dispersed .
WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1895

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you present when the mob was dispersed ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1896

<font> A. <$$font> I was immediately in the rear when the Horse Guards
arrived ; WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1897

I partly suspected the Horse Guards were coming .
WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1898

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Your evidence is all suspicion ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1899

really you must not tell us your suspicions . {TEXT:?}
WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1900

<font> A. <$$font> I saw them arrive , WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1901

and I found that the cause of the mob running , was the arrival of the
Horse Guards . WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1902

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> Did you return to Spa Fields ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1903

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1904

<font> Q. <$$font> Was there any meeting in Spa Fields still continuing
, WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1905

or had they dispersed ? WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1906

<font> A. <$$font> There was a very numerous meeting at Spa Fields when
I got back . WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1907

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know who any of the people were who called
out , " To Spa Fields , " from among the mob ? WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1908

<font> A. <$$font> No , I can@ @not speak to that ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1909

it was a mixed multitude of sailors , and men , and boys .

<font> A. <$$font> I have not . WATSON-1817-1,1,154.1915

<P_1,155>

<font> Q. <$$font> Of any kind ? WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1917

<font> A. <$$font> No . WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1918

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you had any promise made to you ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1919

<font> A. <$$font> No . WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1920

<font> Q. <$$font> Of any kind whatever ? WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1921

<font> A. <$$font> No , of no kind whatever . WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1922

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you ever said that you had had a promise of
some employment ? WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1923

<font> A. <$$font> I never had a promise of any employment , certainly
not . WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1924

<font> Q. <$$font> A promise of any reward ? WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1925

<font> A. <$$font> I have been told that I should be paid for my
labours , as a short-hand writer , WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1926

and I went to Spa Fields expecting to be paid as a short-hand writer .
WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1927

<font> Q. <$$font> You have never said that you expected , or had been
promised any reward whatever ? WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1928

<font> A. <$$font> Certainly not . WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1929

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you never said that you expected a reward or
appointment in consequence of something that had passed ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1930

<font> A. <$$font> No . WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1931

<font> Q. <$$font> Have not you said that , or something of that kind ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1932

<font> A. <$$font> I have said that I expected to be paid for the
labour I performed , as a short-hand writer . WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1933

- It is perhaps unnecessary to state what attendances I had afterwards .
WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1934

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you mean to say , that the reward you have
expected is merely for your labour as a short-hand writer ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1935

<font> A. <$$font> And my attendances in consequence .
WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1936

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you not said , that you expected some reward
from government , not confining it to your wages as a short-hand writer
; that you expected some reward or employment from government ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1937

<font> A. <$$font> I certainly spoke generally , that I expected to be
remunerated for the trouble I had had . WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1938

<font> Q. <$$font> Are those the precise words you used ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1939

<font> A. <$$font> Upon my word I can@ @not recollect the precise words
. WATSON-1817-1,1,155.1940

<P_1,156>

<font> Q. <$$font> You are used to a great deal of precision in taking
a note of other person's words . WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1942

<font> A. <$$font> I do not happen to have taken my own .
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1943

<font> Q. <$$font> You have never said you expected some reward from
government , not confined to your wages as a short-hand writer ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1944

<font> A. <$$font> I have said that I expected to be rewarded generally
certainly for my trouble , WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1945

but never spoke of any appointment , or of any situation ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1946

or applied for any , WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1947

or expected any . WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1948

<font> Q. <$$font> You have never applied for any particular place ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1949

<font> A. <$$font> No . WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1950

<font> Q. <$$font> Nor expected you were to have any particular place ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1951

<font> A. <$$font> Certainly not . WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1952

<font> Q. <$$font> You expect merely a reward for your labours , as a
short-hand writer ? WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1953

<font> A. <$$font> Reward means a reward for labour performed ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1954

and my labours have extended beyond my duties as a short-hand writer .
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1955

<font> Q. <$$font> Then you expect something further ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1956

<font> A. <$$font> I expect something further than my pay per folio .
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1957

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you attend the meeting on the 15th of November ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1958

<font> A. <$$font> I did . WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1959

<font> Q. <$$font> By whose directions did you attend ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1960

<font> A. <$$font> I do not know that I received any directions to
attend . WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1961

<font> Q. <$$font> You must know whether you did or not ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1962

<font> A. <$$font> I believe I did not receive the directions of any
person to attend . WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1963

<font> Q. <$$font> Are you not bound , as a short-hand writer , to know
whether you were sent ? WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1964

Were you sent by any body , and by whom to attend the meeting on the
15th of November ? WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1965

<font> A. <$$font> I was not . WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1966

It was left to my own discretion . WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1967

<font> Q. <$$font> Who spoke to you upon the subject ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1968

<font> A. <$$font> Perhaps it may be necessary to explain -
WATSON-1817-1,1,156.1969

<P_1,157>

<font> Q. <$$font> Who left it to your discretion ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1971

<font> A. <$$font> I will explain . WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1972

I am connected with a public newspaper , WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1973

and have been for some years , WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1974

and it is my duty to do the best I can for my proprietors , and in the
public duty - WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1975

<font> Q. <$$font> This is a speech , and not an answer ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1976

<font> A. <$$font> It is an extempore speech .
WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1977

I can@ @not call to remembrance whether I attended from my own
suggestion , or whether it was suggested to me ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1978

but I attended that meeting . WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1979

<font> Q. <$$font> Who desired you to attend on the 2nd of December ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1980

<font> A. <$$font> I attended by desire of the proprietors of the
Observer newspaper . WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1981

<font> Q. <$$font> Had you any direction from any one in the Secretary
of State@ @'s Office , or any magistrate ? WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1982

<font> A. <$$font> I had not , WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1983

nor never had any previous communication with them .
WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1984

<font> Q. <$$font> Then what is the ground of your claim for wages ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1985

<font> A. <$$font> For labour performed . WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1986

<font> Q. <$$font> They will say they did not send you perhaps ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1987

<font> A. <$$font> Not on that day , WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1988

but subsequently they did . WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1989

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you or not desired to attend there by any
person ? WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1990

<font> A. <$$font> I was not : WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1991

when I arrived at Merlin's Cave I was addressed by a gentleman , an
assistant to Mr. Gurney , the short-hand writer ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1992

and was requested by him to take a note of the speeches in the Field on
that day ; WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1993

and conceiving myself at the moment under Mr. Gurney's immediate
employment , I took a note of these speeches . WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1994

<font> Q. <$$font> How came you to consider yourself under Mr.
Gurney's immediate employment - WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1995

you have nothing to do with Mr. Gurney ? WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1996

<font> A. <$$font> By desire of Mr. Gurney's clerk , that I would
assist him on that day . WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1997

<font> Q. <$$font> Then you were desired by Mr. Gurney's clerk to take
a note ? WATSON-1817-1,1,157.1998

<P_1,158>

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I was . WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2000

<font> Q. <$$font> Your directions came immediately from Mr. Gurney ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2001

<font> A. <$$font> From Mr. Green . WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2002

<font> Q. <$$font> Who is Mr. Green ? WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2003

<font> A. <$$font> Clerk to Mr. Gurney . WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2004

<font> Q. <$$font> Having taken this note on the 2d of December , to
whom did you give the copy when you had transcribed it from your note ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2005

<font> A. <$$font> I gave it to Mr. Beckett .
WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2006

<font> Q. <$$font> Mr. Beckett the Under-secretary of State ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2007

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , so I understand . WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2008

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you any doubt about that ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2009

<font> A. <$$font> I have just now . WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2010

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> I doubt very much whether these
particulars should be enquired into as to the proceedings of government
? WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2011

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> My Lord I am aware of the point which
arose in Mr. Tooke's case , and in Mr. Hardy's , where the name of an
informer was prevented by the Court from being disclosed , on the
grounds of public policy : WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2012

there was no question made , that the name of a magistrate or accredited
person might be asked ; WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2013

and the Court there took the distinction between protecting the name of
a third person , and that of a member or a servant of the public .
WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2014

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> If I am not very much mistaken ,
whether the person had said that he gave information , either to a
member of government , or to some person , with a view to the
communication being made in either case , the counsel were not warranted
to ask that witness who that person was , whether he was a member of
government or not . WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2015

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Your Lordships will allow me , with
great humility , to trouble you with a very few words , having looked
into this point - WATSON-1817-1,1,158.2016

the question first arose , in the instance of a person to whom the
communication had been <P_1,159> made , in order that that person might
be a link between the individual and government ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2017

but an objection was not taken to the question , whether a particular
magistrate or servant of government had not given the directions ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2018

but I am not asking to matters of secret information , but to matters of
fact - to whom he delivered it . WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2019

<font> A. <$$font> Perhaps I might be allowed to explain , in
justification of myself , the circumstances , and the manner in which I
made the communication , to which Mr. Wetherell alludes .
WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2020

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> It was ruled by all the Judges ,
that the witnesses could not be compelled , on cross-examination , to
declare the names of the persons to whom they had given information of
the proceedings of the society , whether such persons were themselves
magistrates , or actually concerned in the administration of government
, or were only the channel through whom the information was conveyed to
government ; WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2021

one of the witnesses however conceiving their views to be dangerous ,
had consulted a private friend what steps he should pursue , who advised
him to communicate the information to government -
WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2022

it was made a question on cross-examination , whether he might not be
compelled to disclose the name of such friend - WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2023

it was ruled he should not , by Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre , Mr. Baron
Hotham , and Mr. Justice Grose ; - contra. the Lord Chief Baron , and
Mr. Justice Buller , WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2024

that is , the note I made before the printed trials came out ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2025

and I have added , see the printed trial , vol. ii. page 405 , vol.
iii. page 88 . WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2026

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Your Lordship's note entirely
corresponds with the printed book which I consulted two days ago ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2027

and if your Lordship's opinion is against me I will not go farther ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2028

the point arose there with respect to producing the middle man ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2029

but I apprehend it was not there decided that the counsel for the
prisoner might not ask the question , whether a person made a
communication to the Secretary of State ? WATSON-1817-1,1,159.2030

<P_1,160>

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> The first proposition , as I have
taken it , being a very young man at the time , is , that it was held by
all the Judges , that the witness could not be compelled to disclose the
name , whether the person was a magistrate , or concerned in the
administration of government , or only the channel through whom the
information was conveyed , WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2032

that is , in the second volume , page 405 . WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2033

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> It is with great deference I should
question the accuracy of your Lordship's note , WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2034

but I apprehend it will be found to be admitted there , that you may
enquire through what Officer of Government the communication was made .
WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2035

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> But a communication to a member of
Government , is a communication to Government ; WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2036

it can@ @not be asked , whether a communication was made to Government
by that person ; WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2037

it is a secret of Government , WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2038

and you have no right to ask it ; WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2039

in Stone's trial , I recollect , Lord Kenyon decided the point .
WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2040

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> My Lord , I will not press any part of
this subject matter further - WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2041

you did , in fact , communicate this to Mr. Beckett ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2042

<font> A. <$$font> If I may be allowed by their Lordships to explain
the innuendo - WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2043

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> No , I do not allow you to explain
it , because I think it is not proper subject for inquiry .
WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2044

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> I do not trace this further than to
Government - WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2045

you communicated this note to some Gentleman - WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2046

I presume the objection does not apply , if the name is not used to the
Under-Secretary of State . WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2047

<font> A. <$$font> To Mr. Beckett . WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2048

<font> Q. <$$font> When did you make the communication to him of the
note ? WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2049

<font> A. <$$font> I think it was the ensuing morning .
WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2050

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you give him , the ensuing morning , the
verbatim copy which you have read to us to-day ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,160.2051

<P_1,161>

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> This is pursuing it in a way in
which I think it ought not to be pursued ; WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2053

there will be no safety in communicating the most important matters to
Government , if those secrets , and the channels of communication are to
be developed ; WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2054

they have formerly been held sacred , WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2055

and I see no reason for departing from the rules which have been laid
down . WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2056

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> One of the witnesses was asked
here - How came you to go then ? WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2057

- I was sent by a Gentleman - WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2058

By whom ? WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2059

- he addresses himself to the Court , WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2060

and says , WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2061

" I am asked , my Lord , by whom , WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2062

if it is proper , I will tell ; " WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2063

<font> Mr. Gibbs , <$$font> one of the Counsel for the Prisoner says ,
" If it be improper I will not ask it ; " WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2064

the Witness says , " If it is a fair question I will answer it directly
; " WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2065

<font> the Lord_Chief_Justice <$$font> says , " There can be no
imputation upon you for answering the question ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2066

if you decline answering , that is another thing ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2067

it exposes you to no difficulties , or penalty , or any thing of that
sort : WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2068

" None , " the witness replies , WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2069

" it is only a point of delicacy , WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2070

I am ready to give an answer , WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2071

I have not the least objection on my part : " WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2072

then <font> Mr. Law <$$font> says , " My Lord , I take it , the
channels for information must be protected {COM:missing_close_quote} :
WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2073

<font> Mr. Attorney_General <$$font> says , " The Court of Exchequer
never would permit that question to be asked {COM:missing_close_quote} :
WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2074

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre <$$font> says , " Upon a general
principle , I do not know whether it ought to be answered : "
WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2075

The Witness says , " It was a person high in office under his Majesty ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2076

but permit me to add , I was not desired by that Gentleman to conceal
his name . " WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2077

<font> Mr. Gibbs <$$font> , " Then where is the delicacy of it ? "
WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2078

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre , <$$font> " He has said what is proper
and material for your purpose , WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2079

that is , that he went there being employed , for the purpose of
collecting information , with a view to the disclosure of it . "
WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2080

<font> Mr. Gibbs , <$$font> " I will not press the question further
than your Lordships think I ought , WATSON-1817-1,1,161.2081

I leave it to the discretion of the Court if it is <P_1,162> thought not
proper . " WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2082

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre , <$$font> " I do not think it is proper
. " WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2083

Then it goes on - WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2084

<font> Mr. Gibbs , <$$font> " Then you were desired by a person high in
Office to go to that place ; WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2085

- how arose your connection {COM:sic} with that Gentleman ? "
WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2086

" My connexion with that Gentleman has been for these ten years , that
is , so far as having the honour of being personally known to him . "
WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2087

- " What sort of connexion had you with him ? "
WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2088

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre , <$$font> " It is hardly proper that the
history of a connexion of that kind should be disclosed here .
WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2089

The Witness says , " that Gentleman would not employ me in any thing
dishonourable , WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2090

nor would I accept it . " WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2091

<font> Mr. Gibbs , <$$font> " I dare say you would not . "
WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2092

Then <font> Lord_Chief_Justice Eyre <$$font> Says , " You find , he went
on purpose to give information of what passed , WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2093

that is the only fact that is material for the prisoner ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2094

the rest is private intercourse , which may involve in it the
consideration of a_thousand other things which may be material to the
government of the country ; WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2095

I think it not proper to be disclosed here , WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2096

it is not necessary to the cause . " WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2097

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Your lordship sees I do not go to any
ulterior conversation between him and government .
WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2098

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> You only wish for the fact of the
communication . WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2099

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Just so , my lord .
WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2100

Did you communicate to the Under_Secretary of State , a full copy of
your report ? WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2101

<font> A. <$$font> I communicated to him a rough copy , intended for
newspaper insertion ; WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2102

it was not so exact a transcript of my notes as that in his lordship's
hand . WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2103

<font> Q. <$$font> Was that the substance , though not so exact ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2104

<font> Mr. Solicitor_General . <$$font> We can@ @not get in to the
contents of a written paper . WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2105

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Did you see in the papers of next
morning the paper you gave for the purpose of insertion ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2106

<font> Mr. Solicitor_General . <$$font> He can@ @not be asked , my
lord , as to the contents of a newspaper , which is not produced .
WATSON-1817-1,1,162.2107

<P_1,163>

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Yes , if he gave it to a newspaper ,
it is by way of verifying it ; WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2109

it is certainly a fact , whether that note was in the paper the next
morning . WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2110

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> Then you must produce that paper
. WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2111

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Did you give your note to Mr. Hone's
publication ? WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2112

<font> A. <$$font> No , indeed , I did not . WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2113

<font> Q. <$$font> Your note you gave to Mr. Beckett the next morning
? WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2114

<font> A. <$$font> I communicated to Mr. Beckett that I had a note the
next morning , WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2115

and gave him a transcript in the evening . WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2116

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you take any note of the word that was upon one
of the flags , WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2117

was it " friends " or " brothers ? " WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2118

<font> A. <$$font> No , I did not , WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2119

neither did I swear positively that it was either the one or the other .
WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2120

- I only swore that I believed the word was , " The brave Soldiers are
our Friends , " WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2121

I would not undertake to say , whether it was friends or brothers .
WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2122

<font> Q. <$$font> You say you took the best note you could of what
passed ? WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2123

<font> A. <$$font> Certainly . WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2124

<font> Q. <$$font> Was there a good deal of noise and disturbance among
the mob , while those two speeches were going on ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2125

<font> A. <$$font> While the two speeches were going on , they were
extremely quiet , WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2126

and were all attention to the speeches ; WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2127

occasionally there were shouts , WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2128

and those shouts did always end immediately . WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2129

<font> Q. <$$font> What time of the day was it , to the best of your
recollection , when the speeches finished on the second of December ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2130

<font> A. <$$font> The speeches of the Watsons I think it must have
been before or by half-@ @past twelve . WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2131

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the younger Watson's the last speech that was
made ? WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2132

<font> A. <$$font> It was . WATSON-1817-1,1,163.2133

<P_1,164>

<font> Q. <$$font> Who else spoke besides the two Watsons ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2135

<font> A. <$$font> Nobody else that I heard . WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2136

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you in a situation in which the people might
perceive you taking the notes ? WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2137

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2138

and many did . WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2139

<font> Q. <$$font> In what part of the field were you ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2140

<font> A. <$$font> I was in front of the waggon .
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2141

<font> Q. <$$font> How far were you from the Watsons ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2142

<font> A. <$$font> I conceive about ten or a_dozen yards from the
waggon . WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2143

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the interval between you and the waggon filled
up by the crowd ? WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2144

<font> A. <$$font> It was . WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2145

<font> Q. <$$font> When you were taking notes of this speech did you
perceive any of the police officers about ? WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2146

<font> A. <$$font> I did not take notice of any .
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2147

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not you see Mr. Stafford near the waggon ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2148

<font> A. <$$font> No . WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2149

<font> Q. <$$font> You met him afterwards ? WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2150

<font> A. <$$font> I saw him afterwards . WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2151

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you happen to know the persons of the police
officers at Bow Street , so as to say , whether they were near you ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2152

<font> A. <$$font> I know the persons of a good many of them .
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2153

I can@ @not say whether they were near the waggon .
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2154

<font> Q. <$$font> You said you spoke to Mr. Stafford ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2155

where was that ? WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2156

<font> A. <$$font> I did not say that I spoke to Mr. Stafford ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2157

I said I saw him . WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2158

<font> Q. <$$font> Where was he when you saw him ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2159

<font> A. <$$font> At the end of Coppice Row .
WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2160

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you chance to see him before the speeches closed
among the crowd ? WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2161

<font> A. <$$font> I did not . WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2162

<font> Q. <$$font> How many minutes was it after the speech had closed
when you saw him taking one of the flags ? WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2163

<font> A. <$$font> In three or four minutes . WATSON-1817-1,1,164.2164

It was not so much as that , <P_1,165> I should think ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2165

the crowd was passing , WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2166

and I saw a rush made by the officers , WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2167

I saw Mr. Stafford among them , WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2168

and I saw the flag fall . WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2169

<font> Q. <$$font> You talked about a magistrate ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2170

to what magistrate did you go ? WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2171

<font> A. <$$font> Mr. Baker . WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2172

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> I do not think he is bound to
disclose the representation he made to government , with a view to
punishment . WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2173

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> My object is to prove the fact of the
notoriety of the meeting , and that in consequence of that notoriety the
short-hand writer , the magistrates , and the police officers were all
present . WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2174

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> You have proved that such and
such magistrates , and such police officers were there .
WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2175

<font> A. <$$font> There were two or three police officers in the room
when I made the representation . WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2176

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Who were those magistrates ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2177

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> I must forbid him to answer that .
WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2178

<$$font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> This was not at the meeting ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2179

it was in a room ? WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2180

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> Was your question as to
magistrates whom he saw there , or magistrates whom he went to
afterwards ? WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2181

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> To magistrates at or near the place .
WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2182

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> You may certainly enquire what
magistrates were on the spot , WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2183

but with respect to the magistrates to whom he made communication in the
course of duty , neither what he communicated , nor the persons to whom
he communicated , can , I think , be evidence - WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2184

if you have a mind to shew that there were many magistrates who were
looking on , and saw what passed , in order to found any argument upon
that , you may prove that fact . WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2185

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> That is all I wish , my Lord ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2186

I do not wish to go to any communication - WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2187

what magistrates were there in Spa Fields - WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2188

how near ? WATSON-1817-1,1,165.2189

<P_1,166>

<font> A. <$$font> In a house , two or three doors beyond the Merlin's
Cave , I found , I think , three magistrates . WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2191

<font> Q. <$$font> Who were they ? WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2192

<font> A. {TEXT:A} <$$font> One , I believe , was Mr. Baker ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2193

the name of the other I do not recollect ; WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2194

there was one , a gentleman belonging to Hatton Garden office .
WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2195

<font> Q. <$$font> How many yards was this house from the place where
the waggon stood , and the speeches were made ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2196

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not estimate the number of yards ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2197

but I suppose four or five_hundred yards at least ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2198

it was a long distance . WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2199

<font> Q. <$$font> Now without asking you what passed between you and
the magistrates , when you had heard the speeches , you went to the
magistrates ? WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2200

<font> A. <$$font> I did . WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2201

<font> Q. <$$font> Were there any police officers with the magistrates
? WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2202

<font> A. <$$font> There were . WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2203

<font> Q. <$$font> How many ? WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2204

<font> A. <$$font> I met two or three in the passage ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2205

and one shewed me the house where they were . WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2206

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you happen to go to the top of Spa Fields to see
whether there were any dragoons ? WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2207

<font> A. <$$font> I did not . WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2208

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you look about to see for any ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2209

<font> A. <$$font> I was in the room in the Merlin's Cave ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2210

and I did not see any . WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2211

<font> Q. <$$font> A red coat on horseback catches the eye ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2212

did you happen to see any in the neighbourhood ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2213

<font> A. <$$font> I did not . WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2214

<font> Q. {TEXT:Q} <$$font> Did you go to any of the magistrates in the
Cold Bath Fields prison ? WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2215

<font> A. <$$font> I did not . WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2216

<font> Q. <$$font> You do not know whether any of the magistrates were
there or not ? WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2217

<font> A. <$$font> I do not . WATSON-1817-1,1,166.2218

<P_1,167>

<font> Q. <$$font> You say that you saw one man there , as you believe
, with a pistol . WATSON-1817-1,1,167.2220

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . WATSON-1817-1,1,167.2221

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see any body else with arms there ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,167.2222

<font> A. <$$font> Another man I saw with a short sword .
WATSON-1817-1,1,167.2223

<font> Q. <$$font> Are you sure about the pistol ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,167.2224

<font> A. <$$font> I have already said , that I believed it to be a

and I saw the Tower was there . WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2257

<font> Q. <$$font> Though the people cried do {COM:sic} go down to the
Tower , you did not go there with them ? WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2258

<font> Q. <$$font> But you did not go down to the Tower ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2260

<font> A. <$$font> I went to the end of the Minories ,

and saw Tower Hill and the Tower . WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2262

<font> Q. <$$font> Where did the people fire their pistols in the air ?

<font> A. <$$font> In the Minories . WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2264

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you go anywhere else but the Minories ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2265

<font> A. <$$font> I followed the crowd up the Minories till they were

<font> Q. <$$font> When were you examined there ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2272

<font> A. <$$font> I do not recollect precisely the date .
WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2273

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you lay before the Grand Jury at Hicks's Hall ,
the copy of your short-hand note you have read to-day ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2274

<font> A. <$$font> I read it to them . WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2275

<font> A. <$$font> I have already told you I do not recollect the exact
date . WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2277

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect the day , or about , when you read
over to the Grand Jury at Hicks's Hall the note of those speeches ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2278

<font> Mr. Solicitor_General . <$$font> My Lord , I apprehend it is
not competent to my learned Friend to ask him what he deposed before the
Grand Jury . WATSON-1817-1,1,168.2279

<P_1,169>

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> I ask him only to facts , the day of
his attendance , and whether he produced the note ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2281

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> On that subject I have a
considerable doubt ; WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2282

I remember a case in which a witness was questioned as to what passed
before the Grand Jury , WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2283

and though it was a matter of considerable importance , he was permitted
to answer ; WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2284

it was a case of life and death . WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2285

<font> Mr. Solicitor_General . <$$font> Certainly , the case having
occurred , I would not trouble your Lordship with a word ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2286

I should have thought , as the Grand Jurymen are sworn to secrecy , what
passed between them ought not to be inquired ? WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2287

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> I had doubts ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2288

and I know many very eminent men at the Bar had doubts ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2289

but I remember the case perfectly . WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2290

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> Can you give me about the date that
you went before the Grand Jury at Hicks's Hall ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2291

<font> A. <$$font> I do not recollect the day , or about the day .
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2292

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect being examined at the Old Bailey ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2293

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2294

<font> Q. <$$font> In Mr. Watson's case ? WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2295

<font> A. <$$font> Not in Mr. Watson's case .
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2296

<font> Q. <$$font> Against Mr. Hooper ? WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2297

<font> A. <$$font> It was against a man of the name of Simmonds ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2298

I was in Court all that day , or the greater part ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2299

but I do not recollect being examined on Mr. Hooper's trial .
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2300

<font> A. <$$font> Have you forgotten going to the Old Bailey to be
examined against Mr. Hooper ? WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2301

<font> A. <$$font> I remember being at the Old Bailey , and being
examined . WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2302

<font> Q. <$$font> Is your name Vincent George Dowling ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2303

<font> A. <$$font> It is . WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2304

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you mean to say you do not recollect being
examined ? WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2305

<font> A. <$$font> I was examined on some trial that day ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,169.2306

<P_1,170>

<font> Q. <$$font> But you do not recollect whether you were on
Hooper's trial ? WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2308

<font> A. <$$font> I know thus much , that to the best of my
recollection I was examined on one or two trials , and there was a trial
on which I was not examined , and where I expected and wished to have
been examined , on account of a particular circumstance that occurred .
WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2309

<font> Q. <$$font> Were you or not examined on Hooper's trial ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2310

<font> A. <$$font> Just give me leave to recollect ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2311

I believe it was on Hooper's trial that I was examined , and not
Simmonds's ; WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2312

I know I was subpoena'd on all of them . WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2313

<font> Q. <$$font> You believe now it was Hooper's , do you ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2314

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2315

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you examine the waggon when you went back to Spa
Fields ? {TEXT:.} WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2316

<font> A. <$$font> I did not . WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2317

<font> Q. <$$font> That did not come within your province ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2318

you were not desired to look into the waggon at all ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2319

<font> A. <$$font> I do not know that I was desired to do any thing
particularly , except take notes of what might take place on the field .
WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2320

<font> Q. <$$font> Have the goodness to recollect whether you were not
examined on Simmonds's trial as well as Hooper's ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2321

<font> A. <$$font> I think , to the best of my recollection , that it
was on Simmonds's , I was not examined , though I expected to be
examined ; WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2322

my recollection , certainly , is not precisely clear as to which of the
trials ; WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2323

I know I was examined on one , and was desirous of being examined on the
other , for a particular reason that occurred .
WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2324

<font> Q. <$$font> How came you to be desirous of being examined ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2325

that is not common ? WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2326

<font> A. <$$font> I will inform you ; WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2327

- I had gone from the Court upon business of my own ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,170.2328

and in my absence , I understood , that Mr. Justice Park in summing up
the evidence , stated , when he came to my name , " the next witness ,
Gentlemen of the <P_1,171> Jury , is Mr. Dowling ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2329

but who this Gentleman is , or what he is , we have not heard ; "
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2330

and I was desirous of acquainting his Lordship who I was , and what I
was , WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2331

and was desirous of informing his Lordship where he might ascertain .
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2332

<font> Q. <$$font> That is all you wished to say ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2333

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , Mr. Gurney and Mr. Alley were present on the
occasion , WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2334

and kindly explained who I was , and what I was .
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2335

<heading>

<font> Re-examined by Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font>
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2337

<$$heading>

<font> Q. <$$font> You have been asked , what were the particular words
upon the banner - WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2339

I did not understand you to say that you took any note of what was on
the banner ? WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2340

<font> A. <$$font> I did not say that I did ; WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2341

I said that I saw a banner , on which there was an inscription .
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2342

<font> Q. <$$font> Whether you are accurate in the words you can@ @not
tell ? WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2343

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say . WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2344

<font> Q. <$$font> You say you took the best notes you could ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2345

did you find any difficulty in taking any note at the time ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2346

<font> A. <$$font> The undulation of the crowd affected me , but not
materially . WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2347

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> It is but justice to the witness to
say , that on looking over all the notes taken by the Court , we none of
us find him mention <font> the <$$font> tri-coloured flag till he
mentioned it with reference to what he had before stated .
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2348

<font> Mr. Dowling . <$$font> I am obliged to your Lordship .
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2349

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> He first spoke of <font> a
<$$font> tri-coloured flag ; WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2350

I have it thus on my note : WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2351

" I saw a flag displayed from the window , white , green , and red . "
WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2352

<font> Mr. Dowling . <$$font> It is only Mr. Wetherell's accuracy
against mine . WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2353

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> He might as well have mentioned the
colours . WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2354

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> He did ; WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2355

after having spoken of being at the Spa Fields meeting , on the 5th of
November , he says , " There was a tri-coloured flag , green , white ,
and red ; " WATSON-1817-1,1,171.2356

<P_1,172>

and then he afterwards says , in another part of his evidence , " I saw
some people bearing flags , one of which was the same , I had seen
exhibited on the 15th from the Merlin's Cave , WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2358

and there was a smaller flag , both tri-coloured . "
WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2359

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> With respect to Mr. Stafford
and the Bow Street officers , did you see any of them near the waggons ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2360

or was the first time you saw them when the mob were advancing from
Coppice Row ? WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2361

<font> A. <$$font> I had seen the Bow Street officers previously at the
corner of Coppice Row ; WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2362

but while at the waggon I did not see them . WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2363

<font> Q. <$$font> The place where you saw the magistrates was at a
distance from that part ? WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2364

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , above the Merlin's Cave . {TEXT:?}
WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2365

<font> Q. <$$font> When a part of the mob went away with young Watson ,
was there a very large number of people left behind in Spa Fields ?
WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2366

<font> A. <$$font> There were a considerable number remained , whom I
left behind . WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2367

Perhaps I ought in justice to myself to {COM:sic} say , that there are
certain explanations which I could have made , which I am not unwilling
to make , but which would do away the insinuations Mr. Wetherell has
made . WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2368

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> The Court have decided that that is
matter {COM:sic} which they can@ @not receive - WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2369

the feelings of the witness must submit to the rules of the Court .
WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2370

<font> Mr. Dowling . <$$font> I am bound by the decisions of the Court
- WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2371

I beg your Lordship's pardon for mentioning another fact ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2372

but your Lordship has announced the wish of the Court , that the
proceedings on this Trial should not be published until its close ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2373

I am fearful , that previous to that desire being expressed , a
publication has been made in many Evening Papers , and probably to the
extent of some thousands , WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2374

- I trust your Lordship will give the Proprietors that indulgence which
their ignorance of your Lordship's wish bespeaks for them .
WATSON-1817-1,1,172.2375

<P_1,173>

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> What has been done can@ @not be
prevented , WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2377

but the desire of the Court must be strictly attended to .
WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2378

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> If I am not wrong in my
recollection , the same direction was given in the trial of Mr. Hardy .
WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2379

<font> Mr. Dowling . <$$font> I was ignorant of that , my Lord ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2380

and was a mere agent for others . WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2381

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> The Court do not pronounce , that
what has been done is not a contempt of the Court ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2382

what the persons publishing have done during the progress of the Trial ,
they have done it at their peril . WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2383

<font> Mr. Dowling . <$$font> I was ignorant of it , my Lord .
WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2384

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> You sent the Attorney_General's speech
, I suppose ? WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2385

<font> Mr. Dowling . <$$font> I have sent no part -
WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2386

I have written no part - WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2387

I was not in Court at that time . WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2388

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> You have sent part of the Prosecutor's
case , I suppose ? WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2389

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> You must not examine this Gentleman
to know whether he has been guilty of an infraction of the order of the
Court . WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2390

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> It would have been as well this
Gentleman should have stopped - WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2391

I do not very well understand this unilateral {TEXT:una-lateral}
note-taking , my Lord . WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2392

<font> Mr. Dowling . <$$font> I do not understand this una-lateral
term . WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2393

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> I will take the liberty of making
application to your Lordship , that as these notes or papers are not
already gone out to the public , they may be stopped .
WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2394

<font> Mr. Justice Bayley . <$$font> I am afraid from what has been
stated , that it is too late , and that many of them have been sent off
by the post . WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2395

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Whether they have incurred the
penalties of the contempt , is a question upon which we do not now enter
; WATSON-1817-1,1,173.2396

the Court has warned such as publish any <P_1,174> part of the
proceeding before it is concluded , that it will be viewed as a high
contempt . WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2397

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> I give you notice , Sir , that if one
of your papers contains the Attorney_General's Speech , I will proceed
upon it . WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2398

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> I assure you , I would be very
sorry there should be one word in any paper whatever ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2399

I would not for a moment countenance such a thing ,
WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2400

but the witness is under the protection of the Court .
WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2401

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Certainly .
WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2402

<font> It being now nearly eight o'clock , four officers were sworn , in
the usual form , to attend the Jury . <$$font> WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2403

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> Gentlemen , I would suggest to you
, that it would not be proper that you should read any newspaper account
of what has passed in Court . WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2404

<font> A Juryman . <$$font> My Lord , I hope we should not think of
doing such a thing . WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2405

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> You will not suppose that I mean to
intimate , that I believe you would do any thing you considered as
improper . WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2406

<font> A Juryman . <$$font> It would be highly improper , my Lord ;
WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2407

certainly we feel it so . WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2408

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> The Court will proceed at nine
o'clock to-morrow morning , Gentlemen . WATSON-1817-1,1,174.2409

from that Bench directed , that none of the proceedings should be
published , <font> de die in diem , <$$font> there has been published a
full account of the Attorney_General's speech in the <font> Observer ,
<$$font> a copy of which I hold in my hand . WATSON-1817-1,1,175.2417

I am the last man to suppose that any editor would wilfully contravene
the directions of the Court , WATSON-1817-1,1,175.2418

I therefore merely mention it . WATSON-1817-1,1,175.2419

I suppose Mr. Dowling's notes were communicated with no intention of
contravening your Lordship's order , WATSON-1817-1,1,175.2420

but I can@ @not help saying , that I think Mr. Dowling appears to be a
partisan {TEXT:partizan} rather than a witness .
WATSON-1817-1,1,175.2421

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> As you have announced that you do
not mean to make any motion , the Court have no time to hear an address
, which is to be followed by no proof . WATSON-1817-1,1,175.2422

If you mean to move for an attachment , the Court will very readily hear
you . WATSON-1817-1,1,175.2423

<font> Mr. Wetherell . <$$font> It is Dowling's paper , which contains
this . WATSON-1817-1,1,175.2424

<font> Mr. Justice Abbott . <$$font> I am pretty confident that when
you were speaking to Mr. Dowling upon that subject , he said he had
taken no notes yesterday . WATSON-1817-1,1,175.2425

<font> Mr. Gurney . <$$font> He did , my Lord .
WATSON-1817-1,1,175.2426

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> If there is to be no motion made ,
it is not necessary to enter into it . WATSON-1817-1,1,175.2427

<P_1,176>

<font> Mr. Attorney_General . <$$font> Perhaps your Lordship will
allow me to say this , WATSON-1817-1,1,176.2429

I am sure that if any body has contravened your Lordship's order , there
is no man more ready to stand forth to enforce the law , or to punish
any person brought before your Lordship , than I shall be , on such an
occasion as this . WATSON-1817-1,1,176.2430

<font> Lord Ellenborough . <$$font> The Court will entertain any motion
that is made upon the subject ; WATSON-1817-1,1,176.2431

if no motion is made , we pass to the business of the Trial .
