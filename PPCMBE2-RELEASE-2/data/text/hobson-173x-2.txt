Tuesday <$$font> . HOBSON-173X-2,288.45

- Spent the morning in meditating on the ill posture of my affairs .
HOBSON-173X-2,288.46

My father had been lame for several years ; my mother old and infirm ,
wore out with age and care . HOBSON-173X-2,288.47

Severall careless servants , not fit to look after business ;
HOBSON-173X-2,288.48

I so weak and so much out of order that I could not tell when I should
be capable myself ; HOBSON-173X-2,288.49

payments comming upon me , which in that condition I knew not how to
provide against ; HOBSON-173X-2,288.50

besides , I had received a letter from London which gave me an account
how the parliament was going to lay such a duty upon Geneva and all
compound liquors as would certainly ruin the distilling trade ,
HOBSON-173X-2,288.51

so I supposed my brothers would be incapable of assisting me upon any
emergency ; all which thoughts depressed my spirits so much , and made
me so weak , that at nine a clock , when I got up , I supposed myself
dying for severall hours . HOBSON-173X-2,288.52

I thank God I had no fearfull thoughts , nor was not at all discouraged
at the apprehensions of death . which I thought every minute
approaching ; HOBSON-173X-2,288.53

but took what care I could to spend that <P_289> small portion of time I
thought I had left to my best spirituall advantage .
HOBSON-173X-2,289.54

I sent for Mr. Clarkson , who came about noon , and administred me the
Sacrament , together with my father and mother , and prayed {TEXT:praed}
with me severall times ; HOBSON-173X-2,289.55

thanks be to Almighty God for my recovery , HOBSON-173X-2,289.56

and I hope the impression which this day's sudden illness made upon me
will never go {TEXT:missing_"go"} out of my mind ; HOBSON-173X-2,289.57

and when I think how suddenly death may overtake one , it will make me
lead a more circumspect life for the future , and allways have regard to
my latter end . HOBSON-173X-2,289.58

Towards night Mr. Gregg came , HOBSON-173X-2,289.59

and I was something better ; HOBSON-173X-2,289.60

he applied large blistering plasters to the wrists of my arms and to my
back , which tormented me very much , and occasioned me to have the
stranguary all the night . HOBSON-173X-2,289.61

He said it was a nervous feaver . HOBSON-173X-2,289.62

At night came Dr. Smithson , who , upon talking with me privately ,
found quickly that it was a mentall as well as corporeall distemper ,
HOBSON-173X-2,289.63

and told me that I had the hypochondriock passion upon me , which then I
could not believe , as being a meer stranger to that distemper , but
found his words very true , HOBSON-173X-2,289.64

for I was afterwards very often so much disordered in my thoughts that I
could not rest nor govern them . HOBSON-173X-2,289.65

In a few days I had every day a shaking fit for an hour , afterwards a
fainting fit for 5 hours successively , which gave me the most pain that
can be immagined while it lasted . HOBSON-173X-2,289.66

Some time after came Dr. Bolderstone , of Coumbridge
HOBSON-173X-2,289.67

<paren> he married the daughter of Mr. Hobson , of Leeds , an
apothecary who was born in this town , and I suppose was some relation
of David and Susan Hobson's who lived and owned {TEXT:owed} a litle
house at the bottom of Dodworth green , now the property of John Wood of
Oxpring walk miln , and Josua Smith of this town <$$paren> ;
HOBSON-173X-2,289.68

he said it was an intermitting feaver , HOBSON-173X-2,289.69

but Dr. Smithison said it was rather St. Vitus' dance , and that I was
in no danger of dying , but rather of a palsie of an apoplexy ;
HOBSON-173X-2,289.70

so I continued to the end of this month . HOBSON-173X-2,289.71

be a scalp , and in it severall large teeth , which were made into
candle sticks , and are now in Bradall . HOBSON-173X-2,296.260

He further told me that , as they are digging for lead , they often meet
with large hollow caves , the roof , and sides , and bottom full of
congealed stone like ice ; HOBSON-173X-2,296.261

and in one there was a spring of water which fell from the roof , and
had made a hollow place at the bottom , in which were 12 stones of the
shape and bigness of a moor hen's <font> egg , <$$font> and speckeled
like them , which he supposes were formed by the motion of the water
turning them round in the hollow where they lay . HOBSON-173X-2,296.262

Christopher Greaves <paren> a blacksmith <$$paren> tells me that in the
bank sides of the river betwixt Hope and Hathersedge , as he has been

among the shales where they were lodg'd , and tumble down the bank side
. HOBSON-173X-2,296.263
