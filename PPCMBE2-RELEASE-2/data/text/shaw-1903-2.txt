<P_3>

<font> A parlormaid enters with a visitor's card . SHAW-1903-2,3.9

Roebuck takes it , SHAW-1903-2,3.10

and nods , pleased . SHAW-1903-2,3.11

Evidently a welcome caller . <$$font> SHAW-1903-2,3.12

Ramsden . Shew him up . SHAW-1903-2,3.13

<font> The parlormaid goes out SHAW-1903-2,3.14

and returns with the visitor . <$$font> SHAW-1903-2,3.15

The Maid . Mr. Robinson . SHAW-1903-2,3.16

{COM:extensive_stage_directions_abbreviated}

<font> As the visitor advances silently to the writing-table , the old
man rises SHAW-1903-2,3.18

and shakes his hand across it without a word : a long , affectionate
shake which tells the story of a recent sorrow common to both .
<$$font> SHAW-1903-2,3.19

Ramsden <bracket> <font> concluding the handshake and cheering up
<$$font> <$$bracket> Well , well , Octavius , it@ @'s the common lot .
SHAW-1903-2,3.20

We must all face it some day . SHAW-1903-2,3.21

Sit down . SHAW-1903-2,3.22

<font> Octavius takes the visitor's chair . SHAW-1903-2,3.23

Ramsden replaces himself in his own . <$$font> SHAW-1903-2,3.24

Octavius . Yes : we must face it , Mr. Ramsden . SHAW-1903-2,3.25

But I owed him a great deal . SHAW-1903-2,3.26

He did everything for me that my father could have done if he had lived
. SHAW-1903-2,3.27

Ramsden . He had no son of his own , you see . SHAW-1903-2,3.28

Octavius . But he had daughters ; SHAW-1903-2,3.29

and yet he was as good <P_4> to my sister as to me . SHAW-1903-2,4.30

And his death was so sudden ! SHAW-1903-2,4.31

I always intended to thank him - to let him know that I had not taken
all his care of me as a matter of course , as any boy takes his father's
care . SHAW-1903-2,4.32

But I waited for an opportunity ; SHAW-1903-2,4.33

and now he is dead - dropped without a moment's warning .
SHAW-1903-2,4.34

He will never know what I felt . SHAW-1903-2,4.35

<bracket> <font> He takes out his handkerchief SHAW-1903-2,4.36

and cries unaffectedly . <$$font> <$$bracket> SHAW-1903-2,4.37

Ramsden . How do we know that , Octavius ? SHAW-1903-2,4.38

He may know it : SHAW-1903-2,4.39

we can@ @not tell . SHAW-1903-2,4.40

Come ! SHAW-1903-2,4.41

do@ @nt {COM:sic_here_and_passim_without_apostrophe} grieve .
SHAW-1903-2,4.42

<bracket> <font> Octavius masters himself SHAW-1903-2,4.43

and puts up his handkerchief <$$font> <$$bracket> . SHAW-1903-2,4.44

That@ @s right . SHAW-1903-2,4.45

Now let me tell you something to console you . SHAW-1903-2,4.46

The last time I saw him - it was in this very room - he said to me : "
Tavy is a generous lad and the soul of honor ; SHAW-1903-2,4.47

and when I see how little consideration other men get from their sons ,
I realize how much better than a son he@ @s been to me . "
SHAW-1903-2,4.48

There ! Does@ @nt that do you good ? SHAW-1903-2,4.49

Octavius . Mr Ramsden : he used to say to me that he had met only one
man in the world who was the soul of honor , SHAW-1903-2,4.50

and that was Roebuck Ramsden . SHAW-1903-2,4.51

Ramsden . Oh , that was his partiality : SHAW-1903-2,4.52

we were very old friends , you know . SHAW-1903-2,4.53

But there was something else he used to say about you .
SHAW-1903-2,4.54

I wonder whether I ought to tell you or not ! SHAW-1903-2,4.55

Octavius . You know best . SHAW-1903-2,4.56

Ramsden . It was something about his daughter . SHAW-1903-2,4.57

Octavius <bracket> <font> eagerly <$$font> <$$bracket> About Ann !
SHAW-1903-2,4.58

Oh , do tell me that , Mr Ramsden . SHAW-1903-2,4.59

Ramsden . Well , he said he was glad , after all , you were not his son
, because he thought that someday Annie and you - SHAW-1903-2,4.60

<bracket> <font> Octavius blushes vividly <$$font> <$$bracket> .
SHAW-1903-2,4.61

Well , perhaps I should@ @n't have told you . SHAW-1903-2,4.62

But he was in earnest . SHAW-1903-2,4.63

Octavius . Oh , if only I thought I had a chance ! SHAW-1903-2,4.64

You know , Mr Ramsden , I do@ @n't care about money or about what people
call position ; SHAW-1903-2,4.65

and I ca@ @n't bring myself to take an interest in the business of
struggling for them . SHAW-1903-2,4.66

Well , Ann has a most exquisite nature ; SHAW-1903-2,4.67

but she is so accustomed to be in the thick of that sort of thing that
she thinks a <P_5> man's character incomplete if he is not ambitious .
SHAW-1903-2,5.68

She knows that if she married me she would have to reason herself out of
being ashamed of me for not being a big success of some kind .
SHAW-1903-2,5.69

Ramsden . <bracket> <font> getting up and planting himself with his
back to the fireplace <$$font> <$$bracket> Nonsense , my boy , nonsense
! SHAW-1903-2,5.70

You@ @'re too modest . SHAW-1903-2,5.71

What does she know about the real value of men at her age ?
SHAW-1903-2,5.72

<bracket> <font> More seriously <$$font> <$$bracket> Besides , she@ @'s
a wonderfully dutiful girl . SHAW-1903-2,5.73

Her father's wish would be sacred to her . SHAW-1903-2,5.74

Do you know that since she grew up to years of discretion , I do@ @n't
believe she has ever once given her own wish as a reason for doing
anything or not doing it . SHAW-1903-2,5.75

It@ @'s always " Father wishes me to , " SHAW-1903-2,5.76

or " Mother would@ @n't like it . " SHAW-1903-2,5.77

It@ @'s really almost a fault in her . SHAW-1903-2,5.78

I have often told her she must learn to think for herself .
SHAW-1903-2,5.79

Octavius <bracket> <font> shaking his head <$$font> <$$bracket> I could@
@n't ask her to marry me because her father wished it , Mr Ramsden .
SHAW-1903-2,5.80

Ramsden . Well , perhaps not . SHAW-1903-2,5.81

No : of course not . SHAW-1903-2,5.82

I see that . SHAW-1903-2,5.83

No : you certainly could@ @n't . SHAW-1903-2,5.84

But when you win her on your own merits , it will be a great happiness
to her to fulfil her father's desire as well as her own .
SHAW-1903-2,5.85

Eh ? Come ! SHAW-1903-2,5.86

you@ @'ll ask her , wo@ @n't you ? SHAW-1903-2,5.87

Octavius <bracket> <font> with sad gaiety <$$font> <$$bracket> At all
events I promise you I shall never ask anyone else . SHAW-1903-2,5.88

Ramsden . Oh , you sha@ @n't need to . SHAW-1903-2,5.89

She@ @'ll accept you , my boy - although <bracket> <font> here he
suddenly becomes very serious indeed <$$font> <$$bracket> you have one
great drawback . SHAW-1903-2,5.90

Octavius <bracket> <font> anxiously <$$font> <$$bracket> What drawback
is that , Mr Ramsden ? SHAW-1903-2,5.91

I should rather say which of my drawbacks ? SHAW-1903-2,5.92

Ramsden . I@ @'ll tell you , Octavius . SHAW-1903-2,5.93

<bracket> <font> He takes from the table a book bound in red cloth
<$$font> <$$bracket> . SHAW-1903-2,5.94

I have in my hand a copy of the most infamous , the most scandalous ,
the most mischievous , the most blackguardly book that ever escaped
burning at the hands of the common hangman . SHAW-1903-2,5.95

I have not read it : SHAW-1903-2,5.96

I would not soil my mind with such filth ; SHAW-1903-2,5.97

but I have read what the papers say of it . SHAW-1903-2,5.98

The title is quite enough for me . SHAW-1903-2,5.99

<bracket> <font> He reads it <$$font> <$$bracket> . SHAW-1903-2,5.100

The Revolutionist's Handbook and Pocket <P_6> Companion .
SHAW-1903-2,6.101

By John Tanner , M. I. R. C. , Member of the Idle Rich Class .
SHAW-1903-2,6.102

Octavius <bracket> <font> smiling <$$font> <$$bracket> But Jack -
SHAW-1903-2,6.103

Ramsden <bracket> <font> testily <$$font> <$$bracket> For goodness' sake
, do@ @n't call him Jack under my roof SHAW-1903-2,6.104

<bracket> <font> he throws the book violently down on the table .
SHAW-1903-2,6.105

Then , somewhat relieved , he comes past the table to Octavius ,
SHAW-1903-2,6.106

and addresses him at close quarters with impressive gravity <$$font>
<$$bracket> . SHAW-1903-2,6.107

Now , Octavius , I know that my dead friend was right when he said you
were a generous lad . SHAW-1903-2,6.108

I know that this man was your schoolfellow , and that you feel bound to
stand by him because there was a boyish friendship between you .
SHAW-1903-2,6.109

But I ask you to consider the altered circumstances . SHAW-1903-2,6.110

You were treated as a son in my friend's house . SHAW-1903-2,6.111

You lived there ; SHAW-1903-2,6.112

and your friends could not be turned from the door . SHAW-1903-2,6.113

This man Tanner was in and out there on your account almost from his
childhood . SHAW-1903-2,6.114

He addresses Annie by her Christian name as freely as you do .
SHAW-1903-2,6.115

Well , while her father was alive , that was her father's business , not
mine . SHAW-1903-2,6.116

This man Tanner was only a boy to him : SHAW-1903-2,6.117

his opinions were something to be laughed at , like a man's hat on a
child's head . SHAW-1903-2,6.118

But now Tanner is a grown man and Annie a grown woman .
SHAW-1903-2,6.119

And her father is gone . SHAW-1903-2,6.120

We do@ @n't as yet know the exact terms of his will ; SHAW-1903-2,6.121

but he often talked it over with me ; SHAW-1903-2,6.122

and I have no more doubt than I have that you@ @'re sitting there that
the will appoints me Annie's trustee and guardian . SHAW-1903-2,6.123

<bracket> <font> Forcibly <$$font> <$$bracket> Now I tell you , once for
all , I ca@ @n't and I wo@ @n't have Annie placed in such a position
that she must , out of regard for you , suffer the intimacy of this
fellow Tanner . SHAW-1903-2,6.124

It@ @'s not fair : SHAW-1903-2,6.125

it@ @'s not right : SHAW-1903-2,6.126

it@ @'s not kind . SHAW-1903-2,6.127

What are you going to do about it ? SHAW-1903-2,6.128

Octavius . But Ann herself has told Jack that whatever his opinions are
, he will always be welcome because he knew her dear father .
SHAW-1903-2,6.129

Ramsden <bracket> <font> out of patience <$$font> <$$bracket> That girl@
@'s mad about her duty to her parents . SHAW-1903-2,6.130

{COM:stage_directions_omitted}

<P_7>

Excuse me , Octavius ; SHAW-1903-2,7.133

but there are limits to social toleration . SHAW-1903-2,7.134

You know that I am not a bigoted or prejudiced man . SHAW-1903-2,7.135

You know that I am plain Roebuck Ramsden when other men who have done
less have got handles to their names , because I have stood for equality
and liberty of conscience while they were truckling to the Church and to
the aristocracy . SHAW-1903-2,7.136

Whitefield and I lost chance after chance through our advanced opinions
. SHAW-1903-2,7.137

But I draw the line at Anarchism and Free Love and that sort of thing .
SHAW-1903-2,7.138

If I am to be Annie's guardian , she will have to learn that she has a
duty to me . SHAW-1903-2,7.139

I wo@ @n't have it : SHAW-1903-2,7.140

I will not have it . SHAW-1903-2,7.141

She must forbid John Tanner the house ; SHAW-1903-2,7.142

and so must you . SHAW-1903-2,7.143

<font> The parlormaid returns . <$$font> SHAW-1903-2,7.144

Octavius . But - SHAW-1903-2,7.145

Ramsden <bracket> <font> calling his attention to the servant <$$font>
<$$bracket> Ssh ! Well ? SHAW-1903-2,7.146

The Maid . Mr Tanner wishes to see you , sir . SHAW-1903-2,7.147

Ramsden . Mr Tanner ! SHAW-1903-2,7.148

Octavius . Jack ! SHAW-1903-2,7.149

Ramsden . How dare Mr Tanner call on me ! SHAW-1903-2,7.150

Say I can@ @not see him . SHAW-1903-2,7.151

Octavius <bracket> <font> hurt <$$font> <$$bracket> I am sorry you are
turning my friend from your door like that . SHAW-1903-2,7.152

The Maid . <bracket> <font> calmly <$$font> <$$bracket> He@ @'s not at
the door , sir . SHAW-1903-2,7.153

He@ @'s upstairs in the drawingroom with Miss Ramsden .
SHAW-1903-2,7.154

He came with Mrs Whitefield and Miss Ann and Miss Robinson , sir .
SHAW-1903-2,7.155

<font> Ramsden's feelings are beyond words . <$$font> SHAW-1903-2,7.156

Octavius <bracket> <font> grinning <$$font> <$$bracket> That@ @'s very
like Jack , Mr Ramsden . SHAW-1903-2,7.157

You must see him , even if it@ @'s only to turn him out .
SHAW-1903-2,7.158

Ramsden . <bracket> <font> hammering out his words with suppressed fury
<$$font> <$$bracket> Go upstairs SHAW-1903-2,7.159

and ask Mr Tanner to be good enough to step down here .
SHAW-1903-2,7.160

<bracket> <font> The parlormaid goes out ; SHAW-1903-2,7.161

and Ramsden returns to the fireplace , as to a fortified position
<$$font> <$$bracket> . SHAW-1903-2,7.162

I must say that of all the confounded pieces of impertinence -
SHAW-1903-2,7.163

well , if these are Anarchist manners , I hope you like them .
SHAW-1903-2,7.164

And Annie with him ! SHAW-1903-2,7.165

Annie ! A- <bracket> <font> he chokes <$$font> <$$bracket> .
SHAW-1903-2,7.166

Octavius . Yes : that@ @'s what surprises me . SHAW-1903-2,7.167

He@ @'s so desperately <P_8> afraid of Ann . SHAW-1903-2,8.168

There must be something the matter . SHAW-1903-2,8.169

<font> Mr John Tanner suddenly opens the door SHAW-1903-2,8.170

and enters . SHAW-1903-2,8.171

{COM:extensive_stage_directions_abbreviated}

He is now in the panic-stricken phase ; SHAW-1903-2,8.173

and he walks straight up to Ramsden as if with the fixed intention of
shooting him at his own hearthrug . SHAW-1903-2,8.174

But what he pulls from his breast pocket is not a pistol , but a
foolscap document which he thrusts under the indignant nose of Ramsden
as he exclaims - SHAW-1903-2,8.175

Tanner . Ramsden : do you know what that is ? SHAW-1903-2,8.176

Ramsden <bracket> <font> loftily <$$font> <$$bracket> No , sir .
SHAW-1903-2,8.177

Tanner . It@ @'s a copy of Whitefield's will . SHAW-1903-2,8.178

Ann got it this morning . SHAW-1903-2,8.179

Ramsden . When you say Ann , you mean , I presume , Miss Whitefield .
SHAW-1903-2,8.180

Tanner . I mean our Ann , your Ann , Tavy's Ann , and now , Heaven help
me , my Ann ! SHAW-1903-2,8.181

Octavius <bracket> <font> rising , very pale <$$font> <$$bracket> What
do you mean ? SHAW-1903-2,8.182

<P_9>

Tanner . Mean ! SHAW-1903-2,9.184

<bracket> <font> He holds up the will <$$font> <$$bracket> .
SHAW-1903-2,9.185

Do you know who is appointed Ann's guardian by this will ?
SHAW-1903-2,9.186

Ramsden <bracket> <font> coolly <$$font> <$$bracket> I believe I am .
SHAW-1903-2,9.187

Tanner . You ! SHAW-1903-2,9.188

You and I , man . SHAW-1903-2,9.189

I ! I ! ! I ! ! ! SHAW-1903-2,9.190

Both of us ! SHAW-1903-2,9.191

<bracket> <font> He flings the will down on the writing table <$$font>
<$$bracket> . SHAW-1903-2,9.192

Ramsden . You ! SHAW-1903-2,9.193

Impossible . SHAW-1903-2,9.194

Tanner . It@ @'s only too hideously true . SHAW-1903-2,9.195

<bracket> <font> He throws himself into Octavius's chair <$$font>
<$$bracket> . SHAW-1903-2,9.196

Ramsden : get me out of it somehow . SHAW-1903-2,9.197

You do@ @n't know Ann as well as I do . SHAW-1903-2,9.198

She@ @'ll commit every crime a respectable woman can ; SHAW-1903-2,9.199

and she@ @'ll justify every@ @one of them by saying that it was the wish
of her guardians . SHAW-1903-2,9.200

She@ @'ll put everything on us ; SHAW-1903-2,9.201

and we shall have no more control over her than a couple of mice over a
cat . SHAW-1903-2,9.202

Octavius . Jack : I wish you would@ @n't talk like that about Ann .
SHAW-1903-2,9.203

Tanner . This chap@ @'s in love with her : SHAW-1903-2,9.204

that@ @'s another complication . SHAW-1903-2,9.205

Well , she@ @'ll either jilt him and say I did@ @n't approve of him , or
marry him and say you ordered her to . SHAW-1903-2,9.206

I tell you , this is the most staggering blow that has ever fallen on a
man of my age and temperament . SHAW-1903-2,9.207

Ramsden . Let me see that will , sir . SHAW-1903-2,9.208

<bracket> <font> He goes to the writing table SHAW-1903-2,9.209

and picks it up <$$font> <$$bracket> . SHAW-1903-2,9.210

I can@ @not believe that my old friend Whitefield would have shewn such
a want of confidence in me as to associate me with - SHAW-1903-2,9.211

<bracket> <font> His countenance falls as he reads <$$font> <$$bracket>
. SHAW-1903-2,9.212

Tanner . It@ @'s all my own doing : SHAW-1903-2,9.213

that@ @'s the horrible irony of it . SHAW-1903-2,9.214

He told me one day that you were to be Ann's guardian ;
SHAW-1903-2,9.215

and like a fool I began arguing with him about the folly of leaving a
young woman under the control of an old man with obsolete ideas .
SHAW-1903-2,9.216

Ramsden <bracket> <font> stupended <$$font> <$$bracket> My ideas
obsolete ! ! ! ! ! ! ! SHAW-1903-2,9.217

Tanner . Totally . SHAW-1903-2,9.218

I had just finished an essay called Down with Government by the
Greyhaired ; SHAW-1903-2,9.219

and I was full of arguments and illustrations . SHAW-1903-2,9.220

I said the proper thing was to combine the experience of an old hand
with the vitality of a young one . SHAW-1903-2,9.221

Hang me if he did@ @n't take me at my word and alter his will -
SHAW-1903-2,9.222

it@ @'s dated only a fortnight after that <P_10> conversation -
appointing me as joint guardian with you ! SHAW-1903-2,10.223

Ramsden <bracket> <font> pale and determined <$$font> <$$bracket> I
shall refuse to act . SHAW-1903-2,10.224

Tanner . What@ @'s the good of that ? SHAW-1903-2,10.225

I@ @'ve been refusing all the way from Richmond ; SHAW-1903-2,10.226

but Ann keeps on saying that of course she@ @'s only an orphan ; and
that she ca@ @n't expect the people who were glad to come to the house
in her father's time to trouble much about her now . SHAW-1903-2,10.227

That@ @'s the latest game . SHAW-1903-2,10.228

An orphan ! SHAW-1903-2,10.229

It@ @'s like hearing an ironclad talk about being at the mercy of winds
and waves . SHAW-1903-2,10.230

Octavius . This is not fair , Jack . SHAW-1903-2,10.231

She is an orphan . SHAW-1903-2,10.232

And you ought to stand by her . SHAW-1903-2,10.233

Tanner . Stand by her ! SHAW-1903-2,10.234

What danger is she in ? SHAW-1903-2,10.235

She has the law on her side ; SHAW-1903-2,10.236

she has popular sentiment on her side ; SHAW-1903-2,10.237

she has plenty of money and no conscience . SHAW-1903-2,10.238

All she wants with me is to load up all her moral responsibilities on me
, and do as she likes at the expense of my character .
SHAW-1903-2,10.239

I ca@ @n't control her ; SHAW-1903-2,10.240

and she can compromise me as much as she likes . SHAW-1903-2,10.241

I might as well be her husband . SHAW-1903-2,10.242

Ramsden . You can refuse to accept the guardianship .
SHAW-1903-2,10.243

<font> I <$$font> shall certainly refuse to hold it jointly with you .
SHAW-1903-2,10.244

Tanner . Yes ; SHAW-1903-2,10.245

and what will she say to that ? SHAW-1903-2,10.246

what does she say to it ? SHAW-1903-2,10.247

Just that her father's wishes are sacred to her , and that she shall
always look up to me as her guardian whether I care to face the
responsibility or not . SHAW-1903-2,10.248

Refuse ! SHAW-1903-2,10.249

You might as well refuse to accept the embraces of a boa constrictor
when once it gets round your neck . SHAW-1903-2,10.250

Octavius . This sort of talk is not kind to me , Jack .
SHAW-1903-2,10.251

Tanner <bracket> <font> rising and going to Octavius to console him ,
but still lamenting <$$font> <$$bracket> If he wanted a young guardian ,
why did@ @n't he appoint Tavy ? SHAW-1903-2,10.252

Ramsden . Ah ! why indeed ? SHAW-1903-2,10.253

Octavius . I will tell you . SHAW-1903-2,10.254

He sounded me about it ; SHAW-1903-2,10.255

but I refused the trust because I loved her . SHAW-1903-2,10.256

I had no right to let myself be forced on her as a guardian by her
father . SHAW-1903-2,10.257

He spoke to her about it ; SHAW-1903-2,10.258

and she said I was right . SHAW-1903-2,10.259

You know I love her , Mr Ramsden ; SHAW-1903-2,10.260

and Jack knows it too . SHAW-1903-2,10.261

Tavy : you must marry her after all and take her off my hands .

And I had set my heart on saving you from her ! SHAW-1903-2,11.285

Octavius . Oh , Jack , you talk of saving me from my highest happiness

Tanner . Yes , a lifetime of happiness . SHAW-1903-2,11.287

If it were only the first half hour's happiness , Tavy , I would buy it

Ramsden . I did not buy it , sir . SHAW-1903-2,12.309

It has been sent me by some foolish lady who seems to admire your views

However , that saves ceremony between us . SHAW-1903-2,12.315

Octavius . May I make a suggestion ? SHAW-1903-2,12.318

Ramsden . Certainly , Octavius . SHAW-1903-2,12.319

Octavius . Are@ @n't we forgetting that Ann herself may have some

Ramsden . I quite intend that Annie's wishes shall be consulted in

But she is only a woman , and a young and inexperienced woman at that .
SHAW-1903-2,12.322

Ramsden <bracket> <font> hotly <$$font> <$$bracket> I do@ @n't want to

And what@ @'s more , she@ @'ll force us to advise her to do it ;

Octavius <bracket> <font> shyly <$$font> <$$bracket> I am not , Jack .
SHAW-1903-2,12.329

So let@ @'s have her down from the drawingroom and ask her what she

SHAW-1903-2,13.343

Tanner <bracket> <font> seriously <$$font> <$$bracket> I know it ,
Ramsden . SHAW-1903-2,13.344

Yet even I can@ @not wholly conquer shame . SHAW-1903-2,13.345

We live in an atmosphere of shame . SHAW-1903-2,13.346

We are ashamed of everything that is real about us ; ashamed of
ourselves , of our relatives , of our incomes , of our accents , of our
opinions , of our experience , just as we are ashamed of our naked skins
. SHAW-1903-2,13.347

Good Lord , my dear Ramsden , we are ashamed to walk , ashamed to ride
in an omnibus , ashamed to hire a hansom instead of keeping a carriage ,
ashamed of keeping one horse instead of two and a groom-gardener instead
of a coachman and footman . SHAW-1903-2,13.348

The more things a man is ashamed of , the more respectable he is .
SHAW-1903-2,13.349

Why , you@ @'re ashamed to buy my book , ashamed to read it :
SHAW-1903-2,13.350

the only thing you@ @'re not ashamed of is to judge me for it without
having read it ; SHAW-1903-2,13.351

and even that only means that you@ @'re ashamed to have heterodox
opinions . SHAW-1903-2,13.352

Look at the effect I produce because my fairy godmother withheld from me
this gift of shame . SHAW-1903-2,13.353

I have every possible virtue that a man can have except -
SHAW-1903-2,13.354

Ramsden . I am glad you think so well of yourself . SHAW-1903-2,13.355

Tanner . All you mean by that is that you think I ought to be ashamed
of talking about my virtues . SHAW-1903-2,13.356

You do@ @n't mean that I hav@ @nt got them : SHAW-1903-2,13.357

you know perfectly well that I am as sober and honest a citizen as
yourself , as truthful personally , and much more truthful politically
and morally . SHAW-1903-2,13.358

Ramsden <bracket> <font> touched on his most sensitive point <$$font>
<$$bracket> I deny that . SHAW-1903-2,13.359

I will not allow you or any man to treat me as if I were a mere member
of the British public . SHAW-1903-2,13.360

I detest its prejudices ; SHAW-1903-2,13.361

I scorn its narrowness ; SHAW-1903-2,13.362

I demand the right to think for myself . SHAW-1903-2,13.363

You pose as an advanced man . SHAW-1903-2,13.364

Let me tell you that I was an advanced man before you were born .
SHAW-1903-2,13.365

<P_14>

Tanner . I knew it was a long time ago . SHAW-1903-2,14.367

Ramsden . I am as advanced as ever I was . SHAW-1903-2,14.368

I defy you to prove that I have ever hauled down the flag .
SHAW-1903-2,14.369

I am more advanced than ever I was . SHAW-1903-2,14.370

I grow more advanced every day . SHAW-1903-2,14.371

Tanner . More advanced in years , Polonius . SHAW-1903-2,14.372

Ramsden . Polonius ! SHAW-1903-2,14.373

So you are Hamlet , I suppose . SHAW-1903-2,14.374

Tanner . No : I am only the most impudent person you@ @'ve ever met .
SHAW-1903-2,14.375

That@ @'s your notion of a thoroughly bad character .
SHAW-1903-2,14.376

When you want to give me a piece of your mind , you ask yourself , as a
just and upright man , what is the worst you can fairly say of me .
SHAW-1903-2,14.377

Thief , liar , forger , adulterer , perjurer , glutton , drunkard ?
SHAW-1903-2,14.378

Not one of these names fit me . SHAW-1903-2,14.379

You have to fall back on my deficiency in shame . SHAW-1903-2,14.380

Well , I admit it . SHAW-1903-2,14.381

I even congratulate myself ; SHAW-1903-2,14.382

for if I were ashamed of my real self , I should cut as stupid a figure
as any of the rest of you . SHAW-1903-2,14.383

Cultivate a little impudence , Ramsden ; and you will become quite a
remarkable man . SHAW-1903-2,14.384

Ramsden . I have no - SHAW-1903-2,14.385

Tanner . You have no desire for that sort of notoriety .
SHAW-1903-2,14.386

Bless you , I knew that answer would come as well as I know that a box
of matches will come out of an automatic machine when I put a penny in
the slot : SHAW-1903-2,14.387

you would be ashamed to say anything else . SHAW-1903-2,14.388

<font> The crushing retort for which Ramsden has been visibly collecting
his forces is lost for ever ; SHAW-1903-2,14.389

for at this point Octavius returns with Miss Ann Whitefield and her
mother ; SHAW-1903-2,14.390

and Ramsden springs up SHAW-1903-2,14.391

{COM:extensive_stage_directions_omitted}

Ramsden . I am sorry , Annie , to force business on you at a sad time
like the present . SHAW-1903-2,16.396

But your poor dear father's will has raised a very serious question .
SHAW-1903-2,16.397

You have read it , I believe ? SHAW-1903-2,16.398

<font> Ann assents with a nod and a catch of her breath , too much
affected to speak . <$$font> SHAW-1903-2,16.399

<bracket> <font> A pause . SHAW-1903-2,16.401

They all look portentous ; SHAW-1903-2,16.402

but they have nothing to say . SHAW-1903-2,16.403

Ramsden , a little ruffled by the lack of any response , continues
<$$font> <$$bracket> I do@ @n't know that I can consent to act under
such conditions . SHAW-1903-2,16.404

Mr Tanner has , I understand , some objection also ; SHAW-1903-2,16.405

but I do not profess to understand its nature : SHAW-1903-2,16.406

he will no doubt speak for himself . SHAW-1903-2,16.407

But we are agreed that we can decide nothing until we know your views .
SHAW-1903-2,16.408

I am afraid I shall have to ask you to choose between my sole
guardianship and that of Mr Tanner ; SHAW-1903-2,16.409

for I fear it is impossible for us to undertake a joint arrangement .
SHAW-1903-2,16.410

Ann <bracket> <font> in a low musical voice <$$font> <$$bracket> Mamma -
SHAW-1903-2,16.411

Mrs Whitefield <bracket> <font> hastily <$$font> <$$bracket> Now , Ann ,
I do beg you not <P_17> to put it on me . SHAW-1903-2,17.412

I have no opinion on the subject ; SHAW-1903-2,17.413

and if I had , it would probably not be attended to .

I am quite content with whatever you three think best .

<font> Tanner turns his head SHAW-1903-2,17.416

Ann <bracket> <font> resuming in the same gentle voice , ignoring her

strong enough to bear the whole responsibility for me and Rhoda without
some help and advice . SHAW-1903-2,17.418

Rhoda must have a guardian ; SHAW-1903-2,17.419

and though I am older , I do not think any young unmarried woman should

Do you intend to call your guardians Granny ? SHAW-1903-2,17.423

Ann . Do@ @n't be foolish , Jack . SHAW-1903-2,17.424

Mr Ramsden has always been Grandpapa Roebuck to me : SHAW-1903-2,17.425

I am Granny's Annie ; SHAW-1903-2,17.426

and he is Annie's Granny . SHAW-1903-2,17.427

Go on , Annie : SHAW-1903-2,17.430

Ramsden <bracket> <font> biting his lip <$$font> <$$bracket> You approve
of your father's choice , then ? SHAW-1903-2,17.433

Ann . It is not for me to approve or disapprove . SHAW-1903-2,17.434

I accept it . SHAW-1903-2,17.435

My father loved me SHAW-1903-2,17.436

and knew best what was good for me . SHAW-1903-2,17.437

Ramsden . Of course I understand your feeling , Annie .
SHAW-1903-2,17.438

It is what I should have expected of you ; SHAW-1903-2,17.439

and it does you credit . SHAW-1903-2,17.440

But it does not settle the question so completely as you think .
SHAW-1903-2,17.441

Let me put a case to you . SHAW-1903-2,17.442

Suppose you were to discover that I had been guilty of some disgraceful

Tavy : do you want to count for something in the world ?
SHAW-1903-2,21.556

Octavius . I want to count for something as a poet : SHAW-1903-2,21.557

I want to write a great play . SHAW-1903-2,21.558

Tanner . With Ann as the heroine ? SHAW-1903-2,21.559

Octavius . Yes : I confess it . SHAW-1903-2,21.560

Tanner . Take care , Tavy . SHAW-1903-2,21.561

The play with Ann as the heroine is all very right ; SHAW-1903-2,21.562

but if you@ @'re not very careful , by Heaven she@ @'ll marry you .
SHAW-1903-2,21.563

Octavius <bracket> <font> sighing <$$font> <$$bracket> No such luck ,
Jack ! SHAW-1903-2,21.564

Tanner . Why , man , your head is in the lioness's mouth :
SHAW-1903-2,21.565

you are half swallowed already - in three bites - Bite One , Ricky ;
Bite Two , Ticky ; Bite Three , Tavy ; SHAW-1903-2,21.566

and down you go . SHAW-1903-2,21.567

Octavius . She is the same to everybody , Jack : SHAW-1903-2,21.568

you know her ways . SHAW-1903-2,21.569

Tanner . Yes : she breaks everybody's back with the stroke of her paw ;
SHAW-1903-2,21.570

but the question is , which of us will she eat ? SHAW-1903-2,21.571

My own opinion is that she means to eat you . SHAW-1903-2,21.572

Octavius <bracket> <font> rising , pettishly <$$font> <$$bracket> It@
@'s horrible to talk like that about her when she is upstairs crying for
her father . SHAW-1903-2,21.573

But I do so want her to eat me that I can bear your brutalities because
they give me hope . SHAW-1903-2,21.574

Tanner . Tavy : that@ @'s the devilish side of a woman's fascination :
SHAW-1903-2,21.575

she makes you will your own destruction . SHAW-1903-2,21.576

Octavius : But it@ @'s not destruction : SHAW-1903-2,21.577

it@ @'s fulfilment . SHAW-1903-2,21.578

Tanner . Yes , of her purpose ; SHAW-1903-2,21.579

and that purpose is neither her happiness nor yours , but Nature's .
SHAW-1903-2,21.580

Vitality in a woman is a blind fury of creation . SHAW-1903-2,21.581

She sacrifices herself to it : SHAW-1903-2,21.582

do you think she will hesitate to sacrifice you ? SHAW-1903-2,21.583

<P_22>

Octavius . Why , it is just because she is self-sacrificing that she
will not sacrifice those she loves . SHAW-1903-2,22.585

Tanner . That is the profoundest of mistakes , Tavy .
SHAW-1903-2,22.586

It is the self-sacrificing women that sacrifice others most recklessly .
SHAW-1903-2,22.587

Because they are unselfish , they are kind in little things .
SHAW-1903-2,22.588

Because they have a purpose which is not their own purpose , but that of
the whole universe , a man is nothing to them but an instrument of that
purpose . SHAW-1903-2,22.589

Octavius . Do@ @n't be ungenerous , Jack . SHAW-1903-2,22.590

They take the tenderest care of us . SHAW-1903-2,22.591

Tanner . Yes , as a soldier takes care of his rifle or a musician of
his violin . SHAW-1903-2,22.592

But do they allow us any purpose or freedom of our own ?
SHAW-1903-2,22.593

Will they lend us to one another ? SHAW-1903-2,22.594

Can the strongest man escape from them when once he is appropriated ?
SHAW-1903-2,22.595

They tremble when we are in danger , SHAW-1903-2,22.596

and weep when we die ; SHAW-1903-2,22.597

but the tears are not for us , but for a father wasted , a son's
breeding thrown away . SHAW-1903-2,22.598

They accuse us of treating them as a mere means to our pleasure ;
SHAW-1903-2,22.599

but how can so feeble and transient a folly as a man's selfish pleasure
enslave a woman as the whole purpose of Nature embodied in a woman can
enslave a man ? SHAW-1903-2,22.600

Octavius . What matter , if the slavery makes us happy ?
SHAW-1903-2,22.601

Tanner . No matter at all if you have a purpose of your own , and are ,
like most men , a mere breadwinner . SHAW-1903-2,22.602

But you , Tavy , are an artist : that is , you have a purpose as
absorbing and as unscrupulous as a woman's purpose . SHAW-1903-2,22.603

Octavius . Not unscrupulous . SHAW-1903-2,22.604

Tanner . Quite unscrupulous . SHAW-1903-2,22.605

The true artist will let his wife starve , his children go barefoot ,
his mother drudge for his living at seventy , sooner than work at
anything but his art . SHAW-1903-2,22.606

To women he is half vivisector , half vampire . SHAW-1903-2,22.607

He gets into intimate relations with them to study them , to strip the
mask of convention from them , to surprise their inmost secrets ,
knowing that they have the power to rouse his deepest creative energies
, to rescue him from his cold reason , to make him see visions and dream
dreams , to <P_23> inspire him , as he calls it . SHAW-1903-2,23.608

He persuades women that they may do this for their own purpose whilst he
really means them to do it for his . SHAW-1903-2,23.609

He steals the mother's milk SHAW-1903-2,23.610

and blackens it to make printer's ink to scoff at her and glorify ideal
women with . SHAW-1903-2,23.611

He pretends to spare her the pangs of child-bearing so that he may have
for himself the tenderness and fostering that belong of right to her
children . SHAW-1903-2,23.612

Since marriage began , the great artist has been known as a bad husband
. SHAW-1903-2,23.613

But he is worse : SHAW-1903-2,23.614

he is a child-robber , a blood-sucker , a hypocrite and a cheat .
SHAW-1903-2,23.615

Perish the race SHAW-1903-2,23.616

and wither a_thousand women if only the sacrifice of them enable him to
act Hamlet better , to paint a finer picture , to write a deeper poem ,
a greater play , a profounder philosophy ! SHAW-1903-2,23.617

For mark you , Tavy , the artist's work is to shew us ourselves as we
really are . SHAW-1903-2,23.618

Our minds are nothing but this knowledge of ourselves ;
SHAW-1903-2,23.619

and he who adds a jot to such knowledge creates new mind as surely as
any woman creates new men . SHAW-1903-2,23.620

In the rage of that creation he is as ruthless as the woman , as
dangerous to her as she to him , and as horribly fascinating .
SHAW-1903-2,23.621

Of all human struggles there is none so treacherous and remorseless as
the struggle between the artist man and the mother woman .
SHAW-1903-2,23.622

Which shall use up the other ? SHAW-1903-2,23.623

that is the issue between them . SHAW-1903-2,23.624

And it is all the deadlier because , in your romanticist cant , they
love one another . SHAW-1903-2,23.625

Octavius . Even if it were so - and I do@ @n't admit it for a moment -
it is out of the deadliest struggles that we get the noblest characters
. SHAW-1903-2,23.626

Tanner . Remember that the next time you meet a grizzly_bear or a
Bengal tiger , Tavy . SHAW-1903-2,23.627

Octavius . I meant where there is love , Jack . SHAW-1903-2,23.628

Tanner . Oh , the tiger will love you . SHAW-1903-2,23.629

There is no love sincerer than the love of food . SHAW-1903-2,23.630

I think Ann loves you that way : SHAW-1903-2,23.631

she patted your cheek as if it were a nicely under_done chop .
SHAW-1903-2,23.632

Octavius . You know , Jack , I should have run away from you if I did
not make it a fixed rule not to mind <P_24> anything you say .
SHAW-1903-2,24.633

You come out with perfectly revolting things sometimes .

Octavius . Is she badly hurt ? SHAW-1903-2,24.652

Has there been an accident ? SHAW-1903-2,24.653

Ramsden . No : nothing of that sort . SHAW-1903-2,24.654

Whitefields . SHAW-1903-2,25.663

And she called on a strange doctor yesterday with a wedding ring on her

Good Heavens , man , what are you crying for ? SHAW-1903-2,25.675

Here is a woman whom we all supposed to be making bad water color
sketches , practising Grieg and Brahms , gadding about to concerts and
parties , wasting her life and her money . SHAW-1903-2,25.676

We suddenly learn that she has turned from these sillinesses to the
fulfilment of her highest purpose and greatest function - to increase ,
multiply , and replenish the earth . SHAW-1903-2,25.677

And instead of admiring her courage and rejoicing in her instinct ;
instead of crowning the completed womanhood and raising the triumphal
strain of " Unto us a chid is born : unto us a son is given , " here you
are - you who have been as merry as grigs in your mourning for the dead

SHAW-1903-2,27.751

Tanner . My dear Ramsden , this is an act of which every man is capable
. SHAW-1903-2,27.752

That is what comes of getting at cross purposes with Nature .
SHAW-1903-2,27.753

The suspicion you have just flung at me clings to us all .

I admit , myself , that there is an element of truth in what <P_28> you

I hope , Octavius , no suspicion of me is possible in your mind .

So be easy : SHAW-1903-2,28.778

our friendship is not in danger . SHAW-1903-2,28.779

cats ! SHAW-1903-2,28.793

Ann . Oh , Jack ! SHAW-1903-2,28.794

Ramsden . You are at present a guest beneath the roof of one of the old
cats , sir . SHAW-1903-2,28.795

My sister is the mistress of this house . SHAW-1903-2,28.796

Tanner . She would put me in the housekeeper's room , too , if she

However , I withdraw cats . SHAW-1903-2,28.798

Cats would have more sense . SHAW-1903-2,28.799

Ann : as your guardian , I <P_29> order you to go to Violet at once and

Ann . I have seen her , Jack . SHAW-1903-2,29.801

And I am sorry to say I am afraid she is going to be rather obstinate

as a moral gymnasium built expressly to strengthen your character in ,
occasionally leads you to think about your own confounded principles
when you should be thinking about other people's necessities .

The need of the present hour is a happy mother and a healthy baby .

Not in our circle , thank you . SHAW-1903-2,30.830

Morality can go to its father the devil . SHAW-1903-2,30.831

Ramsden . I thought so , sir . SHAW-1903-2,30.832

Morality sent to the devil to please our libertines , male and female .

That is to be the future of England , is it ? SHAW-1903-2,30.834

Tanner . Yes ; SHAW-1903-2,33.944

but even the true stories were touched up for telling .
SHAW-1903-2,33.945

A sensitive boy's humiliations may be very good fun for ordinary

SHAW-1903-2,33.947

However , perhaps it was as well for me that I romanced a bit ;

Ann . Oh , never . Never once . SHAW-1903-2,33.950

Up to that time I had played the boy buccaneer with no more conscience
