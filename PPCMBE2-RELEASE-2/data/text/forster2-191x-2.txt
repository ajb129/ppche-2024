Dear Masood I enclose money order for the 10 <slash> + 5.00 fr. that I
owe you . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.9

Take it to the central post office FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.10

<paren> I do@ @n't know the address of any other <$$paren> ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.11

and present it , with your visiting card - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.12

that@ @'s the way I do it at least . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.13

Also give my name if asked . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.14

Let me know if you@ @'re running short of money .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.15

I know that you have been sending some to a friend .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.16

I can easily let you have some , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.17

and indeed debated whether I should make this money order out for a
larger sum , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.18

but it@ @'s a bore to be lent money before you@ @'ve said you want it ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.19

so I did@ @n't . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.20

Many thanks for the Xmas cards . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.21

We all three thought them so pretty . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.22

It@ @'s awfully good of you to think of giving me a birthday present .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.23

I am looking forward to it . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.24

Even more important is it that you let me know what day you return to
England . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.25

We must@ @n't quarrel about sentiment ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.26

We agree that it is the greatest thing in the world ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.27

and only differ as to how it@ @'s to be made the most of ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.28

and while I was reading your letter I did@ @n't even differ .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.29

Who wrote ' Each time that thou goest out of my sight - ' ?
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.30

It is very beautiful . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.31

We had a quiet but orthodox Xmas . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.32

Did you buy a plum pudding ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.33

I am also anxious to know the result of your battle with <font> Madame .
<$$font> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.34

If you <font> hav@ @n't <$$font> fought , my advice is <font> do@ @n't ,
<$$font> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.35

for the sum is small , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.36

she seems very kind , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.37

and furthermore you did@ @n't recapitulate the terms , or make her
repeat them after you , before you took <P_1,101> possession of the
rooms , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.38

and so the thing was not fixed up very tightly .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.39

I was a little nervous when I found you had@ @n't ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.40

and if it@ @'s only 3.50. more per week than you expected , I think
you@ @'ve come off pretty well . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.41

Do@ @n't forget the big <font> Rubens , <$$font>
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.42

& take your history book with you when you look at them .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.43

As for Versailles , go in the middle of the day FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.44

and have - or take - lunch there , so that you may get a good light :
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.45

it@ @'s not much good making expeditions in the afternoon , this time of
year . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.46

St Cloud might also be useful to you . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.47

Do you know how to scan French poetry ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.48

There@ @'s a rule I@ @'d meant to tell you of : FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.49

Final e-mute counts as a syllable , though it must@ @n't be pronounced .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.50

Les sanglots longs ... = 4 syllables FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.51

Blessent mon coeur = " " {COM:4_syllables} FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.52

D'une langueur {COM:footnote_omitted} = " " {COM:4_syllables}
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.53

All these lines are <paren> metrically <$$paren> of the same length .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.54

But when the e mute comes before another word beginning with a vowel ,
or comes at the end of a line , it does@ @n't count .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.55

à la très belle , à la très chere = only 8 syllables .

14 January 1910 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.62

<$$heading>

Dearest boy I am just back from a harassing day ;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.64

on my arrival this morning we had lunch FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.65

and all three went off to Putney in a beastly motor that bumped and
stank FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.66

and gave us head-aches . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.67

However , it was a great thing for my grandmother ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.68

and we left her well and safe at her house . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.69

Then we went on to a long tea party at my aunt's near {COM:sic} , and
then up to Waterloo again , and then down to Weybridge with more people
; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.70

and now would to God I was just arriving at 82 , and beginning to talk
to you . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.71

This letter is to do instead - not that it will .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.72

Well , you know that I was happy with you , and I@ @'ve no need to say
it , and that I think Ste Genevieve most beautiful and most beautifully
framed as does my mother . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.73

But you ought not to have spent such a pot of <P_1,102> money over me .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.74

- I know this will make you cross , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.75

but you ought@ @n't . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.76

It@ @'s far too good for me . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.77

I write looking at it . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.78

It@ @'s a pity the glamour went off Paris . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.79

But nothing influences one so much as fright , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.80

and with your experience , I should have felt the same .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.81

Perhaps you are@ @n't fair to the French . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.82

They have an interest in human capabilities and in ideas that may be
often applied wrongly but is in itself essentially good , and civilised
. FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.83

When M. Constantine said that his countrywomen had beautiful legs he
was better than the English , who pretend that women have no legs at all
! Though best of all are those who take legs for granted .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.84

I meant to have asked more about the man in whose face you threw the
change . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.85

It was a risky thing to do . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.86

Did you actually hit him with it ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.87

Good night . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.88

I am sorry that I fidgeted about the train , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.89

but it would have been grave to miss it , as it would have upset my
mother and grandmother , and thrown out their plans .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.90

Give my best remembrances to your two companions .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.91

I was so glad to see them both again . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.92

I did enjoy stopping with you immensely . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.93

Good night again . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.94

from Forster , member of the Ruling Race to Masood , a nigger .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.95

And let the latter buck up and write . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.96

And let him have a good time at Oxford . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.97

And let him and all his be happy . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.98

Otherwise : Forster will never travel in the same railway carriage with
him again . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.99

20 January 1910 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.105

<$$heading>

Dear Malcolm I began a line to night , in spite of incessant chatter
close to my ear on the subject of art and that .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.107

You praise me for my generosity in writing , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.108

but how far you have left me behind - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.109

two long & delightful letters , and three articles are all on my mind .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.110

So female suffrage leads to polyandry - ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.111

I did so enjoy both - and enjoy and approve of the first .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.112

<paren> This is not to imply that I disapprove of the second <$$paren> .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.113

The fair at Rampur also charms me . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.114

Thank you so very <P_1,103> much for it , and for sending the other two
. FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.115

The idea of the hill country that you convey to me is grandeur with
peace . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.116

Is that right ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.117

Since reading your letters & the articles I have supposed myself to feel
at home there . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.118

The Alps and other mountains that I know feel like boundaries - barriers
between two countries rather than worlds by themselves -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.119

but the Himalayas , partly from their size , partly from their
construction - can hardly give the sense of anything behind , across ,
them - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.120

they must feel like the ' sea that ends not till the world's end ' .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.121

May I see them before I die - the gorge of the Sutlej in particular .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.122

You have given me tremendous pleasure . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.123

I can only write for a little , having as usual put things off till next
day . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.124

I had the luck to find your mother and sister in the other day -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.125

they both seemed well . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.126

So am I . And happy if it were not for politics .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.127

The German scare and snobbery seem doing their worst ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.128

and the appeals this election are made to lower instincts , than
heretofore . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.129

Dishonest , illiberal , the spirit of the petty tradesman , who does@
@n't mind if he@ @'s found out to_morrow , so long as he cheats you
today - that@ @'s the spirit of both sides as it appears to us :
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.130

and I have continually to remind myself that there must be honest effort
& conviction somewhere , hidden behind the froth of either party .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.131

What a rotten letter ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.132

But I want to greet you in the spirit , and accept that though the words
are worthless . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.133

I will write again - by next mail - and tell you all about Paris , where
I have been with Masood . Also about India . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.134

I am reading two books on it at once , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.135

and expect to be most helpful to you . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.136

Meanwhile tell me a little more about it yourself .

10 February 1910 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.144

Dear Malcolm I owe you a letter oh this long while .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.145

I left off the last saying that I was going to tell you something
special in the next , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.146

and now for the life of me I ca@ @n't remember what it is .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.147

It@ @'s a comment on our civilisation . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.148

This reminds me : of my story being read to the Rajah .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.149

<P_1,104>

Well I never ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.151

I do@ @n't know why it should make me smile , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.152

but it does . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.153

That he , sitting in the heart of poetry , should tolerate it seems odd
. FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.154

Perhaps he would think it odd to read a book about Indian Art , as I
have been doing - by Havell . A little petulant in tone , but
fascinating . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.155

Have you ever been to Sanchi ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.156

It does@ @n't look far from Dewas on the map .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.157

This letter is already getting scrappy , as is the way with mine .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.158

Yours really do tell something , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.159

and the description of Dewas and of the way thither is so clear that I
could get there with my eyes shut . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.160

The yogi must have been wonderful . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.161

I expect that to you two such an attitude seems steadily beautiful .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.162

Or do you have your moments of repulsion and think ' What shall it
profit a man to gain his own soul , if he lose the whole world ? '
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.163

It is curious how one's little feelings are connected with the immense
past , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.164

for I am sure that the repulsion of which I speak is our heritage from
Graeco-Roman civilisation . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.165

Logically , the yogi must be right . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.166

Wealth , success , friendship , love , are all one illusion ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.167

and reality , <paren> whatever it may be <$$paren> is obscured by them .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.168

But in practise one shrinks from this conclusion .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.169

The Western world , and in particular the Latin races , have too vivid a
sense of surface-values . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.170

How wonderful - and how comforting - that the yogi should be illogical
at the last moment too ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.171

I thought of you yesterday , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.172

for between the hours of 6.50 , and 8.19 . I made great friends with
the man who was sitting opposite me in the railway carriage ;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.173

and I think you can do that . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.174

We actually exchanged cards , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.175

and think what a wrench that is for English people - not but what he was
Irish which accounts for the whole affair . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.176

If I say that our literary , political , and social judgments concurred
, you will think we were a pair of prigs , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.177

but really he was as different to me as possible ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.178

so at the most there was only one . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.179

I do not <font> think <$$font> he will pick my pocket or murder me -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.180

in the British mind there always lurks this fear -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.181

and this morning I have written to him suggesting a meeting in London .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.182

If it ever comes off , I will tell you about it .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.183

He was a very charming fellow on the surface , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.184

and there@ @'s no reason he should@ @n't be further down .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.185

Now I am in the train again returning to London .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.186

No prospect of life_long friendship here . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.187

My companions are two soldiers , who will not talk to each other so it
is not likely that they will talk to me , and a young lady with the
wings of many blue birds in her hat . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.188

The train is just going over Wiltshire Gap at a frightful lick
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.189

and I am writing very well considering . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.190

The sky is grey , the earth brown . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.191

The only approach to colour is in the valleys , whose green is ruled
with the silver lines of the irrigation : and in the cuttings , where
the chalk is eternally white . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.192

Here is Andover . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.193

The nicer of the two soldiers has got out , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.194

and it has begun to rain . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.195

Cole I met for a second not long ago . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.200

He has been a recluse since his marriage . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.201

Speaking generally , our mutual friends seem all right .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.202

Dickinson asked me to go to Italy with him this Easter ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.203

but I could@ @n't . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.204

He has been electioneering , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.205

and I ought to have done the same , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.206

but do dread it , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.207

and am so ignorant and incompetent . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.208

Hilton Young stood against Austen Chamberlain .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.209

He was defeated heavily , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.210

but I do@ @n't know what he expected . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.211

It may have been satisfactory to him . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.212

I am just going to tea with another vanquished Paladin in the shape of
Sir Frederick Pollock - or rather with his wife & daughter & Sydney
Waterlow , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.213

for I do not expect the warrior himself will be there ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.214

and when he is he always frightens me . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.215

Oh I almost forgot . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.216

I have <font> not <$$font> sent Lady Low a card about the O. {TEXT:O} &

I really can@ @not . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.218

I only inflicted the story on you because we had talked about the

There is no reason that a perfectly innocent person should suffer .

It seems sketchy , though I have no notion what I mean by that useful

and they have@ @n't the peculiar will power to put them right .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.240

Has@ @n't the reception of ' Chantecler ' been humiliating -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.241

all the literary people had wrought themselves into such a state that
disappointment was certain . - And so myself after reading Crime and
Punishment . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.242

But Dostoieffskie always makes one feel ' comfortable ' - again
difficult to define . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.243

Tolstoi does@ @n't . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.244

Henry James does . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.245

George Meredith does@ @n't . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.246

Swinburne does . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.247

Browning does@ @n't . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.248

There certainly are ' dears ' in literature , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.249

and a man may <bracket> be <$$bracket> a dear in any line ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.250

and it has nothing to do with niceness or the drawing_room table .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.251

But whether it has anything to do with literature - .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.252

I have been muddling round this point for some time now ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.253

but ca@ @n't get it clearer . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.254

Again thanking you , and with many regrets : Yours very sincerely E. M.

Hugh Meredith , with whom I am staying , & who is also a friend of
Dickinson's , would very much like to see you .

<bracket> 15 April 1910 <$$bracket> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.263

Dear Malcolm I received your letter with even greater pleasure than
usual , as the <P_1,107> news Hasluck told me made me uneasy .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.264

Being first in Wales , and then here , I had not the opportunity of
calling at Green Street , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.265

& though Hasluck's second letter was so far reassuring that the subject
was not mentioned , I am more glad than I can say to be reassured
properly . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.266

I hope I shall soon hear again : FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.267

what a wretched time you must both have had : FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.268

my love to you both . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.269

We have been here a week , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.270

and if a note of petulance creeps into my remarks , put it down to the
rain , which has continued without a break for 60 hours .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.271

' Non semper imbres - ' FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.272

, & it promises to clear now . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.273

The place is glorious , though the beauties are a trifle well ordered ,
or seen from a somewhat well ordered foreground perhaps , as we are
entirely surrounded by English people mostly of middle age .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.274

A curate , who is almost too stupid to be alive , is close to me ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.275

& pointing out waterfalls to him is his wife , who is haughty & cautious
, & not sure whether my mother & myself will do .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.276

In the hall other guests are making bead necklaces or playing
poker-patience , or deploring the vulgarity of Lloyd George ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.277

and the rest are sleeping . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.278

Has it ever occurred to you that the south coasts of Europe & of Asia
are analogous - three peninsulas , with the chief mountain chain knotted
up at the head of the middle one ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.279

I am accordingly now in the Himalayas , while Dickinson is in Ceylon !
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.280

I should like to have been with him , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.281

but my mother was persuaded to come abroad , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.282

& I am with her - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.283

she is enjoying it , in spite of a bad attack of lumbago .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.284

- I was amused & delighted with your description of your state .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.285

Really you do have - luck I was going to say , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.286

but it is scarcely the word I mean . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.287

I hope that you keep a diary - except that your letters will make up
that deficiency . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.288

You must have seen more than any one of our time at King's .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.289

I like ' do Taubacca ' as a measure for distance , & the people who have
never heard of the Great White Queen . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.290

We go on - if mother is well enough - to Parma , Pisa , Siena , Florence
, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.291

and get back the end of May . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.292

I am anxious to see Hasluck . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.293

He seems to have had a topping time . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.294

Did I tell you I stopped with Dickinson at Cambridge ?
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.295

He was in very good form , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.296

and <font> can@ @not <$$font> swallow America , try though he does .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.297

Your political reading chides me . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.298

I ought to , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.299

but continually postpone . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.300

Just now I am enthralled by Gibbon's Autobiography .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.301

There are passages in it that are more than ' correct ' , and on the
border line of beauty . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.302

What a giant he is - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.303

greatest historian & greatest name of the 18=th= century I say ;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.304

whether it is his greatness or his remoteness that makes his goings on
with religion so queer I do not know . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.305

That such a nature should be preoccupied at all with it personally
puzzles me . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.306

It is a sort of jig_saw puzzle that he plays with a little when not
occupied with more <P_1,108> important things ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.307

but he genuinely regrets that the pieces will not fit .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.308

Write again soon . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.309

West Hackhurst , Abinger Hammer , Dorking FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.315

29 June 1910 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.316

Dear Malcolm A letter , not to say two , should indeed be on its way
from me to you , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.317

but I seem to have done so little lately , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.318

and one that I have begun is left unfinished at home .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.319

This will be an anxious month for you , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.320

and I need not say that my thought & sympathy have been & will be with
you both . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.321

It is terrible to hear of so much discomfort and suffering , though I
can imagine with what courage it has been borne {TEXT:born} .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.322

You say that neither of you have been anxious for a child :
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.323

when it comes surely you will feel differently , and realise it is the
greatest of blessings . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.324

Children are so delightful - and something more besides .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.325

I called at Green Street not long ago , in the hopes of gleaning some
news about you both , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.326

but did@ @n't : - the less as Mrs. Darling was then away at Ober
Ammergau . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.327

I was delighted to speak directly to your sister on the subject that I
knew was occupying her mind as well as mine , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.328

but feared that she might think me intrusive , and perhaps resent it in
other ways . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.329

When I am in London again - the end of July - I shall call again .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.330

I am just going to Harrogate for a fortnight - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.331

a horrible & expensive experience , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.332

but my mother has been ordered there for gout ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.333

and if I do not lead her to the waters , will not drink them .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.334

I shall have my work , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.335

and they say the scenery is fine and the invalids genteel ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.336

but I would give up all and the 80 mineral springs thrown in , for one
hour's ride with you in your hills . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.337

Do@ @n't I recollect <P_1,109> Bashar - <paren> though I spell its name
from memory <$$paren> - ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.338

You leave off at an exciting moment . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.339

Were you backed up at Simla FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.340

or did <paren> forget his name <$$paren> manage to get round people
there ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.341

To be continued in our next , I hope . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.342

Let me tell you a little about India . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.343

I am reading Manucci's ' Storia do Mogor ' - a most entertaining book if
it comes your way . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.344

He goes via Persia FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.345

and arrives in time at the court of Shah Jahan , afterwards fighting
against Aurangzebe whom he loathes . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.346

He is so amusing & vivid about the Indian character that I ca@ @n't
believe it@ @'s all lies , though it is said to be partly .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.347

Now I will tell you about China & Japan . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.348

I have been to Shepherd's Bush , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.349

but was disappointed - the painting huddled away among the commercial
work , & not catalogued . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.350

Then to the British Museum {TEXT:B_M} , which , with coy dignity , has
brought out <font> its <$$font> Chino-Japanese pictures , and simply
knocked Shepherd's Bush into a cocked_hat . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.351

I never imagined such beauty poetry & humour - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.352

at least I knew from specialists they were there ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.353

but never imagined I should see them . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.354

The Chinese things in particular are as easy to love as Fra Angelicos ,
or Botticellis - a ' fairy walking on the waves ' - ; the ' Paradise of
the West ' - gods & goddesses in a bowery garden , even too happy to
drink their cups of tea . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.355

The ' garden of the 100 children ' who are playing endless games without
a single grown_up . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.356

How unlike the " Organised Play " which it was my fate to witness at a
Whitechapel Board School ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.357

I saw Masood yesterday - much flustered about the advancing Missionary
methods - ; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.358

but he generally is flustered over something .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.359

He does not mind the old type , who slammed the heathen on the head with
a bible , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.360

but resents the sympathetic person who dons native dress and says Siva
is another and but an imperfect name for Christ .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.361

I do@ @n't know . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.362

What do you think of missions ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.363

I should be grievously sorry if the whole world became Christians ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.364

but within certain limits missions have their value .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.365

E.g. in Northern Nigeria the missionaries would do something to raise
the population , while the government <paren> if I may judge from a
friend of mine <$$paren> resents all attempts to make the native think
or feel , because it may increase the difficulties of administration .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.366

It is stormy and cold , but beautiful : dog roses , foxgloves , and blue
ancusas in the garden ; also strawberries . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.367

I must stop now , & do some work . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.368

With all messages & wishes : Yours affectionately E. M. Forster .

Dear Malcolm , This is all splendid . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.377

I was very anxious to hear , and partly knew all you were both going
through . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.378

I am pleased about the baby , of course , and more pleased than I can
say that his coming has made other things better .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.379

He is the future , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.380

& our love for him is still hidden in it : FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.381

I never can look beyond the present , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.382

and the present is you two . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.383

I am distressed about your deafness , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.384

& wish you would tell me more about it . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.385

Is there discomfort too ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.386

And how is your general health ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.387

I will not let anything go further if you do not wish .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.388

As to being godfather , I have thought it over during the week ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.389

& have decided to say no . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.390

I have only once said yes , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.391

and that was to parents whose atheism was even more pronounced than my
own . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.392

I do thank you both from the bottom of my heart for trusting & honouring
me , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.393

but in spite of possibly seeming ungracious , I can@ @not feel that I
had better accept . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.394

I hope & think that you will understand . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.395

If I am lucky , when he grows up he will like me
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.396

and I may be of use to him , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.397

but I must leave it there . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.398

<paren> And , outside my family , no grown_up person was ever of any use
to me - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.399

what one really wants is a god-brother , not a godfather <$$paren> .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.400

I stopped a night with Hasluck last week , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.401

and saw picture p.c.s. of India that made my mouth water .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.402

My goodness what a place ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.403

But those Dravidian temples are nightmares . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.404

" Obviously devil worship " says H. FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.405

and they look it , tho' I ca@ @n't believe they really are .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.406

It is so difficult to imagine any one glorifying what he knew to be Evil
, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.407

and if Satanism was studied carefully <paren> I leave the field open !
<$$paren> it would surely prove to be a revolt - however misguided -
against the conventional ideas of good . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.408

Blake and Carducci are clearly this . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.409

One glance at the fields or the sky ought to prove the non-existence of
spiritual evil . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.410

There is disease or decay , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.411

but they are incidental , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.412

and the spiritual power behind them is either Nothing or Good .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.413

- This is a long cry from Hasluck , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.414

and atheists were ever adiabolists , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.415

so I@ @'ll go no further . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.416

<P_1,111>

Next Sat. I go for the week end to Hilton Young's cottage ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.418

and if the weather holds shall walk away from it on the Monday for 2 or
3 days , or longer if people will give me food and shelter ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.419

but there is something very awful in my appearance when I walk alone ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.420

and very often they wo@ @n't . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.421

Ten days later , if weather still holds and various other things go
right , I may walk again under the aegis of E. V. Thompson .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.422

Every one will take me in then . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.423

Do you get any time for reading ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.424

I am taking huge chunks of Mat Arnold . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.425

He@ @'s not as good as he thinks , but better than I thought .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.426

His central fault is prudishness - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.427

I do@ @n't use the word in its narrow sense , but as implying a general
dislike to all warmth . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.428

He thinks warmth either vulgar or hysterical .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.429

Well good night & good_bye . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.430

I do hope you understand about the godfatherhood .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.431

Dear Bob My aunt has not been well enough to have us ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.441

and all our plans have gone to pieces . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.442

I may be walking for a week this month , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.443

I will write again shortly . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.445

I am so glad you are all well . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.446

I have just been to stop with E. H. Young near Marlborough ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.447

and thence walked to the White Horse , Wantage , & Goring , along the

It is glorious country . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.449

I got home last night . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.450

<font> Private <$$font> Sidgwick and Jackson are nibbling , though

That I wo@ @n't have FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.453

but have no objection to ' End Papers . ' FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.454

To come to the point : would it vex Fry if they asked him to design one
? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.455

Does he feel for the stories anything the least approaching enthusiasm ?
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.456

I know that he wants money , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.457

but would rather he went without it than that I procured it him by means
of uncongenial or " contemptuous " work . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.458

I think the stories good myself , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.459

so do not mind learning the opinions of others .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.460

If Fry has had one , and you know it , I should be very grateful .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.461

- This idea has only just occurred to me : FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.462

I have mentioned ' End Papers ' to S. and J. in the vague , but
breathed no further word , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.463

& please do@ @n't you . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.464

I expect nothing will come of it . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.467

Dear Malcolm I am so pleased to get your second letter ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,114.521

but its reference to the godfathership makes me write again .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,114.522

I do trust and think that you will both have understood why I have
refused - how deeply I was moved at your asking , how carefully I
thought it over , how thoroughly I agree with you that it is a grave
matter . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,114.523

I know that I may have put you to incidental inconveniences too ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,114.524

If all goes well , he will like me FORSTER2-191X-2,1,114.526

I could@ @n't be of less use to him than my own official godparents have

and perhaps it@ @'s the emptiness of my own experience in this direction

Promises are too tragic , considering what life is .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,114.530

Dear Sir Some time ago I heard a rumour that my novel <font> The Longest
Journey <$$font> had been mentioned in the <font> Revue des Deux Mondes
. <$$font> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.601

Naturally I was much pleased , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.602

and tried to find out in which number the criticism had appeared , but
without success . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.603

You can judge therefore what pleasure your letter has given me .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.604

I like the book myself - in the peculiar way in which one does like
one's own work - having feared that it was provincial rather than
intimate , and would only interest the limited circle of my friends .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.605

Leaving aside the high authority of the <font> Revue des Deux Mondes ,
<$$font> it does touch me very much that a reader , not an Englishman ,
should care for my book more at a second reading than at a first , and
should detect in it a few of the qualities that I prize myself in the
books of others . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.606

I would like to thank you for your letter , and to add that I have never
received a letter that has encouraged me more .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.607

You are also kind enough to ask about my other books .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.608

About two years ago I published <font> A Room With a View <$$font>

And last month I published a more ambitious work called <font> Howards
End . <$$font> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,117.611

Of this I am venturing to send you a copy - not to secure a mention in
the <font> Revue des Deux Mondes , <$$font> because it is only too
probable that you will not think it worthy of this , but in order that I
may make some slight acknowledgement of the pleasure that your letter

Dear Garnett With the possible exception of the Times , which avowedly

Dearest Boy , I was so glad to hear that you were not vexed with me .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.639

It is such a difficult subject FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.640

and we shall not make anything of it until we talk together even more
freely than we have before . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.641

There are two sides to it - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.642

firstly , it is an experience for you ; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.643

secondly , you may do good to her . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.644

Now , in this latter side I do@ @n't think there is any point at all .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.645

You will not do any good to her . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.646

I am absolutely certain of it . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.647

It is not your fault , or hers ; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.648

This is natural . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.650

The only good you can do is indirectly - through men .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.651

Vice can only be suppressed through men . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.652

Tell every one you know that it is a horrible disgusting notion that
love can be bought for money . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.653

Now , we must meet next Wednesday . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.658

I am engaged all day , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.659

but will you meet me at 10.30 P.M. sharp - if anything a little before
- underneath the clock inside Charing Cross Station ;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.660

it is@ @n't a very big clock , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.661

but it is easy to see - right in the middle of the inside of the facade
. FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.662

Because I feel like you , I am sick of the old conventional surroundings
, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.663

and another sight of 47 Leicester Square is more than I can at present
stand . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.664

So meet me where I say , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.665

and if it is fine we will walk , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.666

and if it is cold we will go and have sandwiches somewhere ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.667

and in either case we will pretend it is Constantinople .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.668

I must tell you one more thing . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.669

My book is selling so well that I shall probably make enough money by it
to come to India . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.670

There will not only be an American edition , but a Canadian , and
perhaps a translation into French . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.671

I do not tell most people this because they would think I was bragging ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.672

Dear Mr. Benson Thank you for your letter , and for the extract from
Mrs. Benson's letter ; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.683

I need not say how flattered I felt by them and how much they interested
me . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.684

Their tone , though , was much too <font> respectful ; <$$font>
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.685

while reading them , I felt as if I had made some serious contribution
to thought or literature , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.686

but I know that I have not . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.687

Thus , I agreed with you that the book is poetical rather than
philosophical . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.688

This sounds arrogant , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.689

but one's confused little mind is visited by impulses of beauty ,
whereas systematic thought can only come to the mind that is both strong
and orderly . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.690

However , it is great fun writing , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.691

and I am sure I do not want to run myself down !
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.692

The house certainly would not appeal so strongly to the idealists ;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.693

I had not thought of that . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.694

Indeed , though the supernatural element in the book is not supposed to

FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.710

for I am not clear of Latham yet . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.711

I have to take my temperature for a week , & then see him again .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.712

Drops of my blood have gone <paren> at a guinea a piece <$$paren> to the
laboratory , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.713

and though no traces of tubercle have been found in them , what is
termed ' the resistant power ' is rather low , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.714

and L. wants to send me for a short period to a Sanitorium .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.715

I think it is all rot , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.716

& shall persuade him against it if I can . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.717

It will be expensive & depressing , and a real worry to my mother , who
will regard it much too seriously . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.718

You wo@ @n't do that , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.719

but still you wo@ @n't want to think of me sitting in a draughty
verandah with a purple nose and an overfilled stomach and an empty brain
, and people who are really ill sitting round me .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.720

So I shall get off if possible . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.721

How can Cambridge remind you of Heaven , and yet of Oxford too ? - !
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.722

<paren> Who@ @'s got a nasty one this time ? <$$paren>
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.723

I am glad that you have seen a real University at last .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.724

- As for L. L. D. {COM:G.L.D.?} I have sent him a line , asking him
to write to you if he has leisure to see people .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.725

Sometimes he has@ @n't , being a busy man , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.726

so you must not think it indifference should you not hear from him .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.727

I know he wants to see you if he can . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.728

My mother returns tomorrow . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.729

I do@ @n't think we can imagine at all how unhappy she feels .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.730

We have never yet lost anyone out of the first rank of those whom we
love . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.731

I will give her your message . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.732

I am reading Lyall's hand book about the English in India - the sort of
thing I required . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.733

Also have failed to read another of Alice Parin's novels called <font>
Idolatry . <$$font> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.734

The other I tried was good , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.735

but this is about missionaries & wicked Hindus and most tiresome .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.736

When will you be back from Cambridge ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.737

I think it@ @'s a very good idea to be there FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.738

but mind you work . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.739

Do you not address your letter from the hospitable mansion of Beg ?
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.740

Is this wise - ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.741

If I can , I shall look in at No 12 on next Wednesday ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.758

but I can@ @not be sure when I get to town . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.759

We <paren> Greenwood & I <$$paren> started walking yesterday in a thick
mist from Swindon to the cottage of a friend of mine near Marlborough .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.760

It was rather beastly , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.761

for we got right up in a cloud , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.762

and should have lost our way but for having a compass .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.763

We did about 14 miles , arriving for tea . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.764

There were two or three others stopping there ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.765

and one of them , Davies , reminded me that you had introduced him and
me at <font> Le Bourgeois gentilhomme . <$$font>
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.766

Do you remember ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.767

His face came back to me when he told me . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.768

I liked him extremely . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.769

How much more grown_up Oxford men are than Cambridge !
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.770

It is a thing I sometimes do@ @n't like in them ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.771

but I liked it in Davies . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.772

He is a clever chap , is he not ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.773

Today G. & I have reached the above pleasing address ;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.774

but do not write to it , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.775

for we leave tomorrow ; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.776

Westbury , Wincanton , & Sherbourne is probably our route , should your
enfeebled frame be able to open an atlas , and your brain be strong
enough to look at it ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.777

I wish I could go walking with you , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.778

but fear you would not care for it - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.779

you athletic brutes are so slack when it comes to the point :
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.780

it is fragile creatures like myself who take their 15 miles a day for a
week and thrive on it . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.781

This reminds me - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.782

I meant to have said it before - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.783

my aunt wants us to fix some day for your visit to her when you can .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.784

She has no engagements , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.785

so any time will do ; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.786

her kind remembrances to you , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.787

& she much wants to see you again . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.788

She was well , though in bed most of the time :
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.789

it is more comfortable for her <P_1,122> till the weather is settled .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.790

My mother's lumbago is also better ; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.791

she is now at Salisbury with Mrs. Aylward . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.792

This makes me easy , and able to enjoy my walk , as I know she is with
some one whom she likes . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.793

If I knew you were all right , I should feel A._I .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.794

This letter , stupid as it is , is intended to cheer you .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.795

I am pleasantly tired , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.796

and G. is strumming little tunes on the piano .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.797

By the way I have been playing THE WALZE the strange harmonies of which
occasionally are beyond me . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.798

Still , it is@ @n't likely one would take in the great
oriento-occidental music of the future at once .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.799

Besides I am forgetting that damned middle part of the tune again .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.800

I suppose you are@ @n't down at Ramsgate alone -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.801

29 July 1911 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.810

Dear Malcolm You have been a slack correspondent lately with reason ; I
without . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.811

There is no reason that I should not have written you a long letter
every week , full of wit and body . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.812

I have been thinking of you all , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.813

but that is no excuse , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.814

for it is easy , indeed inevitable , to think of those one loves .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.815

I wish you did not feel parted from your hills ;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.816

but it@ @'s a feeling that we must all go through .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.817

It is tempting to proceed " But they will come back to us more glorious
for the separation " , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.818

yet I wo@ @n't , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.819

for hills , whether of earth or of the imagination , are too big to play
cup-and-ball with in this comfortable way . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.820

I write to you for 1$$4 hour ; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.821

then I go down to the river , to row my mother & a friend about .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.822

My mother is about the same , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.823

thank you very much . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.824

I ca@ @n't persuade her to take a change . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.825

I am going to Italy myself on Monday - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.826

she will have visitors here . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.827

It@ @'s so hot that the pen <paren> now that I have taken it up
<$$paren> clings to my recreant fingers . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.828

We went to town yesterday to see the Russian Ballet , after which a
thunderstorm broke , flooded the streets and the tubes , sopped me
through , and caused Hasluck , who met us at tea , <P_1,123> to take a
taxi , unheard_of portent . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.829

It looks about to do likewise now , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.830

yet I suppose our heat is nothing like yours .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.831

I will now tell you all about Bashahr . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.832

It is a very remarkable place , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.833

and extraordinary figures may be witnessed at the Rampur fair .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.834

The religion of the country is not Buddhism as Mr. Emerson <paren> an
honest but superficial observer <$$paren> supposes , but Di-theism ;
there being two supreme gods , the Sutlej and the Kailas , the one
proceeding out of the other . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.835

<paren> Do not confuse Ditheism with Dualism , as was recently done by
the Bishop of Lahore <$$paren> . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.836

The Sutlej consents to an occasional garland of wire rope :
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.837

the Kailas are worshipped without ritual . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.838

There are places in Bashahr that might have dropped out of Switzerland ,
and other places that actually have dropped out of the moon - desert
after desert of mountain ranges heaving . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.839

Politics are complicated : FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.840

I will deal with them next time . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.841

Oh and as for some photographs I have received I glanced at them
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.842

but they are very far from giving the spirit of the country ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.843

let me tell you once and for all ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.844

How much more of this are you going to stand ?
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.845

See the results on the human brain , when it is not set to work at files
occasionally ; and further_more when there is going to be a thunderstorm
. FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.846

How undignified ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.847

How unworthy of our Island Race ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.848

Let me hasten to reintroduce those photographs properly .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.849

Thank you for them very much . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.850

They gave me a very good idea of Bashahr , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.851

and I am sending them for safe keeping to your mother ;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.852

she also has very kindly lent me some . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.853

By now - or during now , if there is such a phrase - I have taken my
ladies on the river , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.854

and the storm , whose effects you have already felt , is bursting , or
rather popping , with a maximum of bluster and a minimum of rain .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.855

I have been reading Kipling's child's history of England with mingled
joy and disgust . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.856

It@ @'s a fine conception , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.857

but oh is it necessary to build character on a psychological untruth ?
In other words to teach the young citizen that he is absolutely unlike
the young German or the young Bashahri - that foreigners are envious and
treacherous , Englishmen , through some freak of God , never - ?
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.858

Kipling and all that school know it@ @'s an untruth at the bottom of
their hearts - as untrue as it is unloveable .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.859

But , for the sake of patriotism , they lie . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.860

It is despairing . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.861

How slowly righteousness works up against the tide .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.862

I could@ @n't on the other hand read the New Machiavelli , finding it
too fretful and bumptious , and very inartistic ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.863

but must try again - the more so as Wells , in an article in <font> Le
Temps <$$font> has mentioned me among the authors qui méritent être
mieux connus en France ; on which the <font> New Age <$$font> remarks "
to recommend Forster to the French Nation is to insult its intelligence
; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.864

he simply does not count . " FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.865

The best novels I have come across in the past year are Rosalind
Murray's <font> The Leading Note <$$font> <paren> Josie might like it
<$$paren> ; and <P_1,124> Wedgwood's <font> Shadow of a Titan - <$$font>
unfortunately written in an affected and unreadable style .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.866

So glad JJ. is well & happy . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.867

What are his movements ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.868

Can you have him with you all the year , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.869

or does the climate make it impossible ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.870

Wish you well through the Durbar . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.871

Poor George & Mary will be almost dead before they reach you .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.872

They looked at their last gasp when I saw them at the Coronation
Procession - his face bright red , hers white , and both without the
slightest expression . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.873

When you have a spare day - only then - do send me some Indian Papers -
the Pioneer , and if possible something Nationalist & semi-seditious .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.874

I have read Chirol's book , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.875

and am anxious to taste the Journalism direct -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.876

just specimen copies . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.877

Dear Josie , Your letter arrived today , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.886

FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.887

Now why do@ @n't you write oftener ? FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.888

I extend to you the courteous invitation . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.889

Simla sounds trying . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,124.890

No , I shall <font> not <$$font> take over the house_keeping when I come
to stop with you , good as I am at <P_1,125> that sort of thing .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.891

I came home last week to find the housemaid in hospital ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.892

and we are running this house on a cook , which , small as this house is
, means ' planning ' FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.893

and all that is sobering and unpleasant . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.894

So I shall <font> not <$$font> help you . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.895

I had much rather overlook your mistakes with a courteous smile .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.896

It@ @'s something to be near fine country . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.897

Beastly children ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.898

Why did@ @n't you turn them into the rain ! FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.899

Whether it is something to have the novels of Hardy with you , I doubt .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.900

He is a poet , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.901

and the few novels of his I@ @'ve read were unsatisfying .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.902

However serious the edifice , the ground plan of it is farce .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.903

He@ @'s a poet <paren> I repeat ; having got my previous sentence rather
cockeye <$$paren> - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.904

and only comes to full splendour in his poems .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.905

In them his narrow view of human , and especially female , character
does@ @n't matter , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.906

and Wessex and Destiny at last stand clear out of the mist .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.907

- This sounds arrogant , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.908

but it is much quicker to be arrogant ; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.909

and even where I do@ @n't read Hardy , I have idolatrous reverence for
him . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.910

He is one of the few writers one trusts . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.911

What he said to a friend of mine is very illuminating :
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.912

" I am a very stupid man . " FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.913

He lacks the all-round intelligence that one expects as a matter of
course in this cultivated age - a lack that is often a sign of creative
power . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.914

Michelangelo lacked , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.915

so did William S . ; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.916

Goethe is the only genius who was not stupid .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.917

Malcolm was very entertaining and just about T. H. and Destiny's
clothes in his last letter - received a week ago .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.918

I am writing to him soon . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.919

Meanwhile will you thank him for it and for the Indian Punch .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.920

I had a glorious time in Italy - such weather water and woods .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.921

I was in the Lakes all the time , except for excursions to Milan and
Bergamo , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.922

and managed to keep clear of ' resorts ' . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.923

When you and Malcolm take your Italian villa , I know which Lake it
ought to be on , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.924

but shall not commit its sacred name to paper .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.925

Much did I bathe , much eat , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.926

and lived in a dream till I fell suddenly into England on Basle station
- hundreds of tourists struggling for half that number of seats on the
midnight train , and shouting that all would be well if the others would
behave like Gentlemen . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.927

The sacred word reechoed loudly . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.928

Eight in the carriage , still chanting it , we started , our legs
intertwined like spillikins , so that if one gentleman moved in the
night , all the other seven woke up . FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.929

The train was two hours late , the boat later .
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.930

I returned a little discontented to Albion , FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.931

and still long for the beautiful forms of the Italian hills .
