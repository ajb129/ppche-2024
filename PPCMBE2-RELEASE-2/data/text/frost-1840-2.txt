? FROST-1840-2,236.52

- He first formed them in front of the house ; FROST-1840-2,236.53

- Yes ; I returned through the house FROST-1840-2,236.66

from the large doors from the street into the yard ; FROST-1840-2,236.68

they were formed again in the yard , FROST-1840-2,236.69

and I directed the large doors to be closed after them , which was done
. FROST-1840-2,236.70

Do you know how they were secured ? FROST-1840-2,236.71

- I believe they were fastened on the inside by means of a square piece
of iron which crosses them ; FROST-1840-2,236.72

I then took Lieutenant Gray into the room , to the eastern end of the
house , FROST-1840-2,236.73

and told him that I had proposed that the soldiers should go into that
room , if he approved of it , as a proper position for them ;
FROST-1840-2,236.74

he did approve of it ; FROST-1840-2,236.75

but it was necessary that it should be ventilated , FROST-1840-2,236.76

and the troops were not marched into it for some little time .
FROST-1840-2,236.77

They were stationed there with Lieutenant Gray and two serjeants ?
FROST-1840-2,236.78

- They were ; FROST-1840-2,236.79

soon afterwards I went into the passage , FROST-1840-2,236.80

and learning that the party advancing to the town were then in the town
- FROST-1840-2,236.81

That is the passage that leads from the end room into the
commercial-room ? FROST-1840-2,236.82

- I passed through that passage into the front passage , opening to the
front door , FROST-1840-2,236.83

and then I directed the special constables , who were about the door ,
to withdraw into the house , which was done ; FROST-1840-2,236.84

and I directed the front door to be closed , which was also done ;
FROST-1840-2,236.85

the door was afterwards opened , FROST-1840-2,236.86

and two or three special constables were put in charge of the door ,
with orders to permit no one to enter . FROST-1840-2,236.87

I then went from that passage into the room above what you call the
commercialroom , at the west end of the building ; FROST-1840-2,236.88

it is a room , I believe , of the same size and of the same form , with
bow-windows , as that has . FROST-1840-2,236.89

On the first floor ? FROST-1840-2,236.90

- On the first floor of the building ; FROST-1840-2,236.91

Coming down Stowe-hill ? FROST-1840-2,236.93

<P_237>

Is there a view from that bow-window ? FROST-1840-2,237.96

plan , through which I could see a body of men passing the wing of the
house formed in column . FROST-1840-2,237.97

- They were what I call a column of men , formed regularly abreast of

FROST-1840-2,237.103

I stayed a short time at the window to observe the appearance and
formation of the body , FROST-1840-2,237.104

and I then ran hastily down stairs into the passage below .
FROST-1840-2,237.105

When I got opposite the bar , which is immediately in front of the door
, I there saw the heads of what appeared to me to be a column , or a
body of men , entering the door ; FROST-1840-2,237.106

I believe they were , at the instant , within the door-way ,
FROST-1840-2,237.107

but if not within the door-way , they were close upon the door-way .
FROST-1840-2,237.108

That is the front porch ? FROST-1840-2,237.109

Through the passage ? FROST-1840-2,237.119

- Through the passage , FROST-1840-2,237.120

Beaten against , from where ? FROST-1840-2,237.134

What effect did that produce ? FROST-1840-2,237.136

- The lower half of each shutter was closed , FROST-1840-2,237.137

and I heard a noise against the board as if the shutters were pushed
against violently , FROST-1840-2,237.138

and the glass above was broken . FROST-1840-2,237.139

Had the lower half of the shutters been shut when the soldiers were

What happened upon that ? FROST-1840-2,238.165

trousers , FROST-1840-2,238.169

From whence did those shots proceed ? FROST-1840-2,238.171

with this mob or multitude , even that is not admissible evidence .
FROST-1840-2,240.272

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> When was he brought ?
FROST-1840-2,240.273

- It was before day-break ; FROST-1840-2,240.274

he was brought in the morning . FROST-1840-2,240.275

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <font> Which is a mandril ?
FROST-1840-2,240.276

- This is what is called a mandril - <bracket> <font> pointing it out
<$$font> <$$bracket> FROST-1840-2,240.277

- it is used by the colliers in the mines in cutting coal .
FROST-1840-2,240.278

<heading>

<font> Cross-examined by Mr. Kelly . <$$font> FROST-1840-2,240.280

<$$heading>

Will you allow me to ask you what is your business or profession ?
FROST-1840-2,240.282

- I am an attorney . FROST-1840-2,240.283

Are you in partnership with Mr. Protheroe , the gentleman who has been
sitting in court during this proceeding ? FROST-1840-2,240.284

- I was , till the close of the year that has just ceased .
FROST-1840-2,240.285

For a very great number of years ? FROST-1840-2,240.286

- From June 1824 . FROST-1840-2,240.287

Have you had any other business or calling than that of an attorney ?
FROST-1840-2,240.288

- I have been interested in coal-mines , FROST-1840-2,240.289

and am still . FROST-1840-2,240.290

I observe , in this long account which you have given of this
unfortunate transaction , that you have not once mentioned Mr. Frost's
name ? FROST-1840-2,240.291

- No , I have not . FROST-1840-2,240.292

Do you know Mr. Frost ? FROST-1840-2,240.293

- I do . FROST-1840-2,240.294

How long have you known him ? FROST-1840-2,240.295

- For a period of 17 or 18 years . FROST-1840-2,240.296

Were you well acquainted with him about the time when the Reform Bill
was in progress ? FROST-1840-2,240.297

- Yes , I was . FROST-1840-2,240.298

Previously to that time had you been on good terms with him ?
FROST-1840-2,240.299

- I had known very little of him , FROST-1840-2,240.300

and had had no personal intercourse with him of any kind .
FROST-1840-2,240.301

<P_241>

Had your firm - yourself and Mr. Prothero , any dealings or
transactions with him ? FROST-1840-2,241.303

- None at all . FROST-1840-2,241.304

Do you know whether any differences had arisen between him and either
yourself or Mr. Prothero ? FROST-1840-2,241.305

- With Mr. Prothero there had . FROST-1840-2,241.306

Did those differences continue till near about the time of the Reform
Bill ? FROST-1840-2,241.307

- I think not ; FROST-1840-2,241.308

my impression is that there was an action brought by Mr. Prothero
against Mr. Frost , and two indictments against him for a libel ;
FROST-1840-2,241.309

I do not know when the sentence upon the indictment was passed ,
FROST-1840-2,241.310

I think in 1823 or 1824 ; FROST-1840-2,241.311

and for some years afterwards , I am not aware that any differences of
any kind existed between Mr. Prothero and Mr. Frost .
FROST-1840-2,241.312

Except the state of variance which such proceedings might have
occasioned , you do not know of any variance or any new proceeding ?
FROST-1840-2,241.313

- None at all . FROST-1840-2,241.314

About the time of the Reform Bill , did you yourself become more
particularly acquainted with Mr. Frost ? FROST-1840-2,241.315

- I met him in public . FROST-1840-2,241.316

Did you meet him , among other occasions , at public meetings ?
FROST-1840-2,241.317

- I did . FROST-1840-2,241.318

Had you opportunities of observing his public conduct during that time ?
FROST-1840-2,241.319

- I had . FROST-1840-2,241.320

And afterwards ? FROST-1840-2,241.321

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,241.322

I need hardly ask you , whether at the time to which I have alluded ,
about the period of the Reform Bill , there was a great deal of
excitement at Newport , as well as at other places ?
FROST-1840-2,241.323

- There were public meetings held at Newport upon the subject .
FROST-1840-2,241.324

Was there a great deal of excitement ? FROST-1840-2,241.325

- There was a good deal of interest felt in the subject .
FROST-1840-2,241.326

Was there no more than interest , FROST-1840-2,241.327

was there not a very great deal of excitement at the time ?
FROST-1840-2,241.328

- I should say , there was excitement , certainly .
FROST-1840-2,241.329

You say , that you yourself attended public meetings about that time ?
FROST-1840-2,241.330

- I did . FROST-1840-2,241.331

Have you attended meetings at the same time as Mr. Frost ?
FROST-1840-2,241.332

- I have ; FROST-1840-2,241.333

I have seen him present at meetings at which I have been present .
FROST-1840-2,241.334

And , I believe , from that time to this , Mr. Frost has taken a very
prominent part in politics and at public meetings ?
FROST-1840-2,241.335

- He has . FROST-1840-2,241.336

Have you yourself done so likewise ? FROST-1840-2,241.337

- Not very prominent . FROST-1840-2,241.338

Did you , at the time to which I have alluded , about the time of the
Reform Bill ? FROST-1840-2,241.339

- I attended a few public meetings on two or three occasions ,
FROST-1840-2,241.340

and took part in the discussions at those meetings .
FROST-1840-2,241.341

I must ask you , whether you yourself have not at public meetings , or
at a public meeting , declared , that the majority of <P_242> 37 in the
House of Lords , who had voted against the Reform Bill , deserved
guillotining , or something to that effect ? FROST-1840-2,242.342

- No , certainly not . FROST-1840-2,242.343

You deny that ? FROST-1840-2,242.344

- Distinctly . FROST-1840-2,242.345

Or any thing to that effect ? FROST-1840-2,242.346

- Certainly , nothing to that effect . FROST-1840-2,242.347

Will you undertake to say that you have made no observation at all
concerning the deserts , in your estimation , of that majority of 37 in
the House of Lords ? FROST-1840-2,242.348

- I have no recollection of saying any thing at all approaching to what
you stated . FROST-1840-2,242.349

Will you undertake to say that you have not ? FROST-1840-2,242.350

- To my recollection I have not . FROST-1840-2,242.351

I will call the place to your recollection . FROST-1840-2,242.352

At a meeting at the Guildhall at Usk ; FROST-1840-2,242.353

did you ever attend such a meeting ? FROST-1840-2,242.354

- I did , at the county hall at Usk , at which the high sheriff presided
- a county meeting . FROST-1840-2,242.355

We must go by steps . FROST-1840-2,242.356

I ask you if you did not there publicly make some observation concerning
that majority in the House of Lords ? FROST-1840-2,242.357

- I may have done so . FROST-1840-2,242.358

Did you not do so in fact ? FROST-1840-2,242.359

I ask you , upon your oath , did you not make some observation :
FROST-1840-2,242.360

we shall , by-and-by , perhaps , find what it is ? FROST-1840-2,242.361

- I believe I did . FROST-1840-2,242.362

Concerning the majority of 37 in the House of Lords .
FROST-1840-2,242.363

Have you , now that you have had a little time to recollect yourself ,
any doubt that you did ? FROST-1840-2,242.364

- I have already told you that I believe I did make some observation .
FROST-1840-2,242.365

Have you any doubt that you did ? FROST-1840-2,242.366

- I have not . FROST-1840-2,242.367

Now , will you tell me , to the best of your recollection , what was
that observation ? FROST-1840-2,242.368

- I can@ @not tell you . FROST-1840-2,242.369

Did you make any observation importing what you thought that majority
deserved ? FROST-1840-2,242.370

- According to my recollection , I censured the majority ,
FROST-1840-2,242.371

but as far as my recollection goes , I did it in no offensive terms
whatever . FROST-1840-2,242.372

Did you say any thing as to what they deserved , in your opinion ?
FROST-1840-2,242.373

- I do not recollect that I did ; FROST-1840-2,242.374

I believe I did not . FROST-1840-2,242.375

Or what you wished they might meet with ? FROST-1840-2,242.376

- I believe not . FROST-1840-2,242.377

Try FROST-1840-2,242.378

and recollect yourself , whether you did not say at that meeting
something to this effect , that you wished they might meet with the fate
of certain parties in France , in allusion to the French Revolution ?
FROST-1840-2,242.379

- I believe not . FROST-1840-2,242.380

Did you make any allusion to any parties in France , as connected with
that observation ? FROST-1840-2,242.381

- I believe I alluded to what had occurred in France .
FROST-1840-2,242.382

Did you not allude to the fate of the predecessors of the present King
of the French ? FROST-1840-2,242.383

- I may have done so , FROST-1840-2,242.384

but I have no recollection whether I did or not . FROST-1840-2,242.385

Did you not make an observation , relative to that majority of 37 , in
connexion with the fate of those persons in France ?
FROST-1840-2,242.386

- I have no recollection of having done any thing of the kind .
FROST-1840-2,242.387

<P_243>

Will you undertake to swear that you did not ? FROST-1840-2,243.389

- I will not undertake to swear , having no recollection on the subject
. FROST-1840-2,243.390

Did you make any observation concerning the Bishops ?
FROST-1840-2,243.391

- I have no recollection . FROST-1840-2,243.392

Were there not about that time very serious disturbances in Newport ?
FROST-1840-2,243.393

- I know of none at all . FROST-1840-2,243.394

Do you remember the period when the present Duke of Beaufort was
insulted ? FROST-1840-2,243.395

- I recollect hearing that the present Duke of Beaufort , when
canvassing the town , met with some insult . FROST-1840-2,243.396

Were there not some disturbances at Newport , at the time when the
present Duke of Beaufort was a candidate ? FROST-1840-2,243.397

- I was not a witness of any . FROST-1840-2,243.398

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Was that at the time of
this riot ? FROST-1840-2,243.399

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> No , my Lord , at the time of
the Reform Bill . FROST-1840-2,243.400

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> You say that you were not present at any
of those disturbances ? FROST-1840-2,243.401

- I was not . FROST-1840-2,243.402

Were you at that time a magistrate ? FROST-1840-2,243.403

- I was not . FROST-1840-2,243.404

Or mayor ? FROST-1840-2,243.405

- No . FROST-1840-2,243.406

Then I understand you to say , that you have no knowledge of any part
taken by Mr. Frost at the time of those disturbances ?
FROST-1840-2,243.407

- I have not . FROST-1840-2,243.408

None at all ? FROST-1840-2,243.409

- None whatever . FROST-1840-2,243.410

You say that you were present at public meetings where Mr. Frost was .
FROST-1840-2,243.411

During all the time that you have had an opportunity of actually
observing his political and public conduct , was there any thing
reprehensible in it , in your judgment ? FROST-1840-2,243.412

- I frequently differed with Mr. Frost upon questions upon which I took
an opposite view , in which some heat may have been shown ;
FROST-1840-2,243.413

but I was witness to nothing that , I should say , was distinctly
reprehensible . FROST-1840-2,243.414

You have differed with him as any persons may , whose conduct is
perfectly irreproachable ? FROST-1840-2,243.415

- When I say that , my recollection is brought to a meeting in which I
certainly thought Mr. Frost acted with a good deal of want of temper ,
or feeling , towards me individually . FROST-1840-2,243.416

I am not asking you as to his temper towards an individual ;
FROST-1840-2,243.417

I am asking you as to his public conduct , as far as you yourself
personally observed , FROST-1840-2,243.418

and I particularly call your attention to those times of excitement , of
which you have spoken , when you say he took a very prominent part ;
FROST-1840-2,243.419

I ask whether there was any thing in his conduct tending to riot , or
other illegal proceeding ? FROST-1840-2,243.420

- I think not . FROST-1840-2,243.421

Have you had any opportunities of observing his public conduct since he
was made a magistrate ? FROST-1840-2,243.422

- I have . FROST-1840-2,243.423

During how many years was he a magistrate ? FROST-1840-2,243.424

- I should say three years , to my recollection , or nearly so .
FROST-1840-2,243.425

During the whole of that time was not his public conduct , as <P_244> a
magistrate , praiseworthy , as far as you had an opportunity of
observing ? FROST-1840-2,244.426

- I would rather not have answered that question ; FROST-1840-2,244.427

I may have found fault with Mr. Frost's public conduct as a magistrate
, FROST-1840-2,244.428

and I have done so ; FROST-1840-2,244.429

but I am not prepared to say that Mr. Frost was not acting from his
belief of what was right or wrong . FROST-1840-2,244.430

Have you ever seen any thing which you had just reason to believe was
otherwise than what he believed to be right ? FROST-1840-2,244.431

- I would rather say that I have not , certainly ; that I have not
witnessed any thing but what he himself may have believed to be right .
FROST-1840-2,244.432

You have always lived in Newport , I believe ? FROST-1840-2,244.433

- Not always ; FROST-1840-2,244.434

I have lived in Newport 20 years . FROST-1840-2,244.435

Do you know that very particular inquiries were made concerning Mr.
Frost's fitness and propriety of conduct before he was appointed a
magistrate ? FROST-1840-2,244.436

- I do not . FROST-1840-2,244.437

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> I am very unwilling to
interpose to object to any questions that may be put ;
FROST-1840-2,244.438

but that , I submit , is not a proper question . FROST-1840-2,244.439

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> He has answered the question ;
FROST-1840-2,244.440

he says he does not know . FROST-1840-2,244.441

I have asked you hitherto concerning Mr. Frost's public character ;
FROST-1840-2,244.442

I will now ask you , as long as you have known or heard any thing about
him , has not his private character , as a private individual and member
of a family , been perfectly good ? FROST-1840-2,244.443

- I should say not . FROST-1840-2,244.444

As a member of a family ? FROST-1840-2,244.445

- That I know nothing of . FROST-1840-2,244.446

It was concerning that that I asked you ? FROST-1840-2,244.447

- I understood you to ask me respecting his character as a private
individual ; FROST-1840-2,244.448

I took it in two branches ; FROST-1840-2,244.449

as a member of a family , I know nothing of him whatever .
FROST-1840-2,244.450

I ask you as to his character in the relations of private life with his
family ? FROST-1840-2,244.451

- I know nothing whatever of his relations in private life with his
family . FROST-1840-2,244.452

Did you know Vincent ? FROST-1840-2,244.453

- I have seen Vincent . FROST-1840-2,244.454

Were you present at his trial ? FROST-1840-2,244.455

- I was . FROST-1840-2,244.456

What had you to do with his trial ? FROST-1840-2,244.457

- The trial was conducted by the magistrates ; FROST-1840-2,244.458

the management of the proceedings was intrusted by the Government to the
magistrates of the borough . FROST-1840-2,244.459

At the time you were mayor ? FROST-1840-2,244.460

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,244.461

Consequently when you were a magistrate yourself ? FROST-1840-2,244.462

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,244.463

Then , in fact , you , in your public capacity , were one of his
prosecutors ? FROST-1840-2,244.464

- I was ; FROST-1840-2,244.465

at least I considered the Government to be his prosecutors ,
FROST-1840-2,244.466

and the magistrates were merely the local agents in conducting it by
means of their clerk . FROST-1840-2,244.467

He was , we understand , convicted and sentenced to some term of
imprisonment ? FROST-1840-2,244.468

- He was , at the last assizes for this county . FROST-1840-2,244.469

Do you not know that a great deal of dissatisfaction has been expressed
publicly concerning the mode in which he is supposed <P_245> to have
been treated ? FROST-1840-2,245.470

- I do not know it , except from the same sources of information that
you may . FROST-1840-2,245.471

I am not a witness , FROST-1840-2,245.472

but you are ; FROST-1840-2,245.473

do not you know that the supposed treatment of Vincent , since he has
been a prisoner , has been a subject of public complaint ?
FROST-1840-2,245.474

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Do you know any thing of it ,
but what you may have seen in the newspapers ? FROST-1840-2,245.475

- I do not . FROST-1840-2,245.476

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Whatever may be his means of information ,
I apprehend I am entitled to ask whether the imprisonment of Vincent ,
or the supposed mode of treatment of Vincent , has not been made a
subject of public complaint - whether it was not notorious that that was
so ? FROST-1840-2,245.477

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> That is not the question
that you put ; FROST-1840-2,245.478

your Question was , " whether he knew it ? " FROST-1840-2,245.479

he says he only knows it by seeing it in the newspapers .
FROST-1840-2,245.480

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> That might be the very mode in which it
became publicly notorious . FROST-1840-2,245.481

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> You must produce the newspapers .
FROST-1840-2,245.482

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> I apprehend it is not necessary to produce
the newspapers in order to show that any matter is publicly notorious .
FROST-1840-2,245.483

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> But he knows nothing of it ,
except through that medium . FROST-1840-2,245.484

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> The witness thinks fit to answer me in
that way ; FROST-1840-2,245.485

he says , " I only know it from the newspapers . " FROST-1840-2,245.486

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> It might be in various ways
; FROST-1840-2,245.487

there might be public meetings in which it was discussed ;
FROST-1840-2,245.488

you may ask him that question ; FROST-1840-2,245.489

but if he only knows {TEXT:know} it through the newspapers , he must
produce the newspapers . FROST-1840-2,245.490

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Now attend to the form of my question ;
FROST-1840-2,245.491

do you know that complaints have become public and notorious on the
subject of Vincent's supposed treatment ? FROST-1840-2,245.492

- I do not , as I have already stated , except from having seen it in a
particular paper , which is said to be edited and conducted by himself ,
called the " Western Vindicator . " FROST-1840-2,245.493

Do you know whether any complaints concerning the supposed treatment of
Vincent have been the subject of discussion among the magistrates ?
FROST-1840-2,245.494

- I do not . FROST-1840-2,245.495

I believe you did not , as mayor of Newport , act with the county
magistrates ? FROST-1840-2,245.496

- I did not . FROST-1840-2,245.497

Have there been any meetings within your own knowledge of late for the
purpose of putting down the chartists or chartism ?
FROST-1840-2,245.498

- No , I know of none . FROST-1840-2,245.499

You have attended none ? FROST-1840-2,245.500

- No , not recently . FROST-1840-2,245.501

Within the last year ? FROST-1840-2,245.502

- I attended a public meeting at Christ-church in the spring of the year
, for the purpose of agreeing upon an address of loyalty to the Queen ,
and an offer of supporting the lawful authority by enrolling ourselves ,
if called upon , in an association . FROST-1840-2,245.503

<P_246>

Had that any thing to do with the chartists or chartism ?
FROST-1840-2,246.505

- The meeting was produced by the public meetings held upon the subject
of chartism . FROST-1840-2,246.506

That meeting , then , was produced by chartism ? FROST-1840-2,246.507

- It was . FROST-1840-2,246.508

And directed against it ? FROST-1840-2,246.509

- In so far as supporting the lawful authority might be supposed to be
directed against it . FROST-1840-2,246.510

Were you at Newport during the whole of the 3d of November , the Sunday
? FROST-1840-2,246.511

At what time was it , as nearly as you remember , that you first
received any intelligence of a nature which led you to employ special
constables ? FROST-1840-2,246.513

- As far back as the Thursday previously I received information that led
me to make inquiries , which ended in my giving , on Saturday , orders
to the superintendent of the police to have special constables ready ;
but not for the Sunday night , but for a subsequent night , for the
Tuesday night . FROST-1840-2,246.514

You first received some information which put you on inquiries on

I made inquiries on Thursday ; FROST-1840-2,246.517

I want to know when you first actually appointed any constables ?
FROST-1840-2,246.519

- Special constables had been sworn in some months ago .

put in motion the police ? FROST-1840-2,246.521

- On the Saturday I gave instructions to the superintendent of the
police . FROST-1840-2,246.522

Where was it that any person was first , as far as you know , taken into
custody ? FROST-1840-2,246.523

- I think as early as 12 o'clock on the night of Sunday ,
FROST-1840-2,246.524

but it may have been later ; FROST-1840-2,246.525

I will not be positive as to the time ; FROST-1840-2,246.526

it was not earlier than 12 , I believe . FROST-1840-2,246.527

Were all the persons , as they were successively taken into custody ,
brought to the Westgate Inn ? FROST-1840-2,246.528

- They were brought to the Westgate , before Mr. Brewer , my colleague
, who was there sitting , and myself . FROST-1840-2,246.529

Had you any opportunity of observing , after you yourself received the
wound under which you now suffer , how soon the mob dispersed ?
FROST-1840-2,246.530

- I should say in about ten minutes , or perhaps less .
FROST-1840-2,246.531

In ten minutes the place was clear ? FROST-1840-2,246.532

- I will not say the place was clear . FROST-1840-2,246.533

I understood that the street was clear in about ten minutes afterwards .
FROST-1840-2,246.534

I do not know whether I have quite correctly taken your answer with
regard to one matter . FROST-1840-2,246.536

to the French Revolution , or any observation in connexion with the
French Revolution ? FROST-1840-2,247.553

returned to me , FROST-1840-2,248.603

At this time were the guns of your soldiers charged ?
FROST-1840-2,248.605

Were the lower shutters of the three windows shut ?
FROST-1840-2,248.607

they were forming in front . FROST-1840-2,248.613

Over the half_shutters you could perceive weapons ?
FROST-1840-2,248.614

- Spears and pikes ; FROST-1840-2,248.617

I saw they were forming in front of the building . FROST-1840-2,248.618

Did the weapons seem to be in a line ? FROST-1840-2,248.619

- They appeared to be forming very steadily , from the manner in which
the weapons came up before the window ; FROST-1840-2,248.620

they then discharged a volley of small arms at us , and at the same time
rushing through the building by the hall-door , which they had forced ,
or which had been left open . FROST-1840-2,248.621

When they fired this volley of small arms at you , what effect did that
produce upon the windows ? FROST-1840-2,248.622

- It tore the windows in different parts ; FROST-1840-2,248.623

I perceive that it was caused by slugs and balls ; FROST-1840-2,248.624

the window-shutters were torn by the effect of the slugs and balls
discharged at us . FROST-1840-2,248.625

Down to that time had your men loaded their guns ? FROST-1840-2,248.626

- We were then unmasked ; FROST-1840-2,249.648

we were exposed to their view by the shutters being opened ,
FROST-1840-2,249.649

and another volley of small arms was discharged at us .
FROST-1840-2,249.650

Did you perceive that the mayor had been wounded ? FROST-1840-2,249.651

- Not immediately ; FROST-1840-2,249.652

our men commenced firing at the windows when the shutters were opened .

When the shutters were removed , did you find that the glass had been
broken ? FROST-1840-2,249.654

- The windows had been lifted up ; FROST-1840-2,249.655

That was before the shutters were closed ? FROST-1840-2,249.659

Your men then fired through the windows ? FROST-1840-2,249.661

- They did ; FROST-1840-2,249.662

the mob effected an entrance into the building by the hall ,
FROST-1840-2,249.663

and our firing continued for about half a minute at the windows ,
FROST-1840-2,249.664

and the door-way communicating with the passage of the house was secured
till the rush had subsided , and till the special constables had time to
get clear of the mob . FROST-1840-2,249.665

Where did the special constables go to ? FROST-1840-2,249.666

- Some of them went up to the top of the building , but most of them
behind into the court-yard ; FROST-1840-2,249.667

the door was then opened , FROST-1840-2,249.668

and our firing commenced into the passage . FROST-1840-2,249.669

Did you go into the passage ? FROST-1840-2,249.670

- I did . FROST-1840-2,249.671

of the room ? FROST-1840-2,249.676

. FROST-1840-2,249.677

Did you see whether any of them had arms ? FROST-1840-2,249.678

- Some of them had arms ; every one that I saw ; FROST-1840-2,249.679

there were very few that I did see . FROST-1840-2,249.680

Your men fired into this passage ? FROST-1840-2,249.681

- Our men fired into that passage , FROST-1840-2,249.682

and soon the body of one of the mob fell across the passage , who was
killed . FROST-1840-2,249.683

Could you at all judge how long the firing continued ?
FROST-1840-2,249.684

- Less than 10 minutes , the whole affair . FROST-1840-2,249.685

By that time were the streets cleared , and the mob dispersed ?
FROST-1840-2,249.686

<P_250>

- The streets were soon cleared of all dangerous objects ,
FROST-1840-2,250.688

but the attack in the inner part of the building continued to the last ,
FROST-1840-2,250.689

and whenever the smoke cleared away , they attempted to force our
position . FROST-1840-2,250.690

Was that after the firing in the street had begun ?
FROST-1840-2,250.691

- After the firing in the street had begun . FROST-1840-2,250.692

In what manner did they try to force your position ?
FROST-1840-2,250.693

- By attempting to rush up to the door-way ; FROST-1840-2,250.694

but they always faltered when they encountered their own dead ,
FROST-1840-2,250.695

and then received our fire . FROST-1840-2,250.696

Was the passage entirely cleared within the 10 minutes ?
FROST-1840-2,250.697

- Cleared of all except the dead and wounded ; FROST-1840-2,250.698

I gave my men directions then to spare their ammunition .
FROST-1840-2,250.699

- No ; I averaged that they fired about three rounds per man ,
FROST-1840-2,250.701

Did you see any ammunition that had belonged to the mob ?
FROST-1840-2,250.703

we broke up some , FROST-1840-2,250.705

Where did you see this ammunition that you say had belonged to the mob ?
FROST-1840-2,250.707

- It was taken from the pockets of those who were killed .

description of powder , and made up like soldier's , with ball-cartridge

How many rounds did you find upon him ? FROST-1840-2,250.715

- I am not aware exactly ; FROST-1840-2,250.716

but I dare say about 30 or 40 . FROST-1840-2,250.717

skilfully made up ? FROST-1840-2,250.718

- Yes , there was a good deal of ammunition loose .

Where did you go then ? FROST-1840-2,251.778

- I then entered the building FROST-1840-2,251.779

and occupied the room on the right flank of the building .
FROST-1840-2,251.780

The room where the firing took place ? FROST-1840-2,251.781

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,251.782

How long did you stay there before you received the order to load ?
FROST-1840-2,251.783

- I received no orders to load . FROST-1840-2,251.784

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> What he said was , that he
gave orders to load . FROST-1840-2,251.785

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I understood Sir Thomas Phillips to
say , that he ordered them to load . FROST-1840-2,251.786

Did Sir Thomas Phillips give you any orders to load ?
FROST-1840-2,251.787

- I do not remember receiving any orders to load . FROST-1840-2,251.788

What did he give you orders to do ? FROST-1840-2,251.789

- We consulted together , FROST-1840-2,251.790

and as it was the expectation that the mob would attack us in the
building , he was anxious that I should enter it ; FROST-1840-2,251.791

he <P_252> offered me this room , which , on examination , I found
capable of answering for the purpose very well , as it was on the ground
floor , and as it communicated with the steps and with the house ;
FROST-1840-2,252.792

I brought my men there ; FROST-1840-2,252.793

I did not load , because there was no immediate necessity ;
FROST-1840-2,252.794

it is a point upon which I am the only judge . FROST-1840-2,252.795

You say you were about a minute in front of the building , and then 10
minutes in the court-yard ? FROST-1840-2,252.796

- About 10 minutes in the court-yard . FROST-1840-2,252.797

And then you went into the building , FROST-1840-2,252.798

and went to this room , which you and Sir Thomas Phillips agreed was a
fit position for you to occupy ? FROST-1840-2,252.799

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,252.800

You say you did not receive any orders to load , FROST-1840-2,252.801

but you loaded because you thought the time was come when it was
necessary to do so ? FROST-1840-2,252.802

- I loaded when I was fired on ; FROST-1840-2,252.803

I required no orders to load ; FROST-1840-2,252.804

I had not time to look for instructions , FROST-1840-2,252.805

and there was no necessity for it . FROST-1840-2,252.806

Were you fired on the moment the shutters were opened ?
FROST-1840-2,252.807

- The moment the shutters were opened , that served to expose us ,
FROST-1840-2,252.808

and we received a fresh volley . FROST-1840-2,252.809

Had you been fired on before ? FROST-1840-2,252.810

- We were fired on when the mob came in front of the building .
FROST-1840-2,252.811

Before the shutters were opened ? FROST-1840-2,252.812

- Before the shutters were opened . FROST-1840-2,252.813

Did you then give orders to load ? FROST-1840-2,252.814

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,252.815

The shutters were opened for the purpose of giving effect to your fire
upon the mob ? FROST-1840-2,252.816

- To allow our men to fire ; FROST-1840-2,252.817

the shutters were about a foot higher than the men ,
FROST-1840-2,252.818

and unless the shutters were opened the soldiers could not fire .
FROST-1840-2,252.819

Unless they fired in the air ? FROST-1840-2,252.820

- Soldiers do not do that . FROST-1840-2,252.821

But many shots came in over the glass ? FROST-1840-2,252.822

- Yes , a great many . FROST-1840-2,252.823

Many of the shots were in the ceiling ? FROST-1840-2,252.824

- Many in the ceiling . FROST-1840-2,252.825

Then the practice of the mob was different from that of the military ,
FROST-1840-2,252.826

and all the damage they did was to break the windows and to make a hole
in the ceiling ? FROST-1840-2,252.827

- And to tear the shutters , and to wound one of our party , and Sir
Thomas Phillips . FROST-1840-2,252.828

That was not until after the shutters were opened ?
FROST-1840-2,252.829

- No . FROST-1840-2,252.830

Do not mix matters together that I am endeavouring to keep separate ;
FROST-1840-2,252.831

what I want to know distinctly is , whether you did not load for the
purpose of firing before you opened the shutters ? FROST-1840-2,252.832

- I loaded for the purpose of firing before I opened the shutters .
FROST-1840-2,252.833

You say you expended about three rounds of ball-cartridge ?
FROST-1840-2,252.834

- I averaged it at about three rounds per man . FROST-1840-2,252.835

How long were you in that room before the firing over the shutters into
the ceiling commenced ? FROST-1840-2,252.836

- Something better than five minutes . FROST-1840-2,252.837

<P_253>

<heading>

<font> Re-examined by Mr. Attorney-general . <$$font>
FROST-1840-2,253.840

<$$heading>

Before you opened the shutters , had there been firing against the
shutters ? FROST-1840-2,253.842

- There had been firing against the shutters , and through the shutters
. FROST-1840-2,253.843

Were the shutters damaged by that firing before you opened the shutters
? FROST-1840-2,253.844

- The shutters were damaged and torn by that firing before I opened the
shutters . FROST-1840-2,253.845

Could you see whether the shot marks were on a level with you ?
FROST-1840-2,253.846

- Perfectly on a level with us , FROST-1840-2,253.847

but the shutters protected us in a great measure . FROST-1840-2,253.848

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> What was on a level with him , the
marks in the shutters ? FROST-1840-2,253.849

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Yes , my Lord .
FROST-1840-2,253.850

Could you tell whether the balls in the ceiling had glanced against the
shutters ? FROST-1840-2,253.851

- Very likely they might have done so . FROST-1840-2,253.852

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> That was not the question ;
FROST-1840-2,253.853

you were asked not whether it was likely , but whether you could tell ?
FROST-1840-2,253.854

- I could not tell . FROST-1840-2,253.855

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> If they had glanced against the
shutters , might that have taken them up into the ceiling where you saw
them ? FROST-1840-2,253.856

- We can never account for how a ball goes ; FROST-1840-2,253.857

it takes all directions . FROST-1840-2,253.858

But independently of the balls that went into the ceiling , can you say
whether , before you opened the shutters , the balls struck the shutters
on a level with you ? FROST-1840-2,253.859

- The balls struck the shutters on a level with me ;
FROST-1840-2,253.860

the other balls in the ceiling I did not remark till after the whole
attack ; FROST-1840-2,253.861

but those I perceived the very moment they occurred .
FROST-1840-2,253.862

<font> Foreman of the Jury . <$$font> Did the mob fire at the military
after the military were completely unmasked ? FROST-1840-2,253.863

- They fired a volley on us the moment we opened the shutters ;
FROST-1840-2,253.864

and they might have fired a great deal more , FROST-1840-2,253.865

but our fire commanded theirs , FROST-1840-2,253.866

and the din and noise was so great that I could not tell what they did ,
except from a knowledge of the wounds we received .
FROST-1840-2,253.867

<font> Foreman of the Jury . <$$font> My Lord , that seems to me a very
important point , FROST-1840-2,253.868

and the answer we have received is hardly a satisfactory one ;
FROST-1840-2,253.869

will your Lordship have the goodness to put the question to the witness
in the way you think best , whether the mob fired upon the military
after they knew the military were in this room , after they had exposed
themselves . FROST-1840-2,253.870

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> He says that the mayor and
Serjeant Daily were wounded after the shutters were thrown up .
FROST-1840-2,253.871

<font> Foreman of the Jury . <$$font> This difficulty suggests itself
to my mind - whether those wounds might not have been received by the
continuous random firing of the mob previous to the unmasking .
FROST-1840-2,253.872

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Do you mean before the
shutters were thrown up ? FROST-1840-2,253.873

<P_254>

<font> Foreman of the Jury . <$$font> Yes , my Lord .
FROST-1840-2,254.875

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> You want to know whether they
continued firing after they knew the military were in the room ?
FROST-1840-2,254.876

<font> Foreman of the Jury . <$$font> That is the point I want to have
ascertained . FROST-1840-2,254.877

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> The gentlemen of the jury
want to know , whether you mean to say , that the mob deliberately fired
upon the military , after they knew you were there , when the shutters
were opened ? FROST-1840-2,254.878

- I have no reason to suspect otherwise ; FROST-1840-2,254.879

the mob fired deliberately upon us when they saw us unmasked ;
FROST-1840-2,254.880

I was prepared for it , FROST-1840-2,254.881

and as I was prepared , they did so . FROST-1840-2,254.882

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Are you satisfied that the mob saw
you at the time they fired the volley upon you ? FROST-1840-2,254.883

- I am satisfied they must have seen me . FROST-1840-2,254.884

<font> Foreman of the Jury . <$$font> That is what I wanted to know .
FROST-1840-2,254.885

- <font> Witness . <$$font> The windows extended to the very floor ,
FROST-1840-2,254.886

and I was exposed , every part of me . FROST-1840-2,254.887

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> In your uniform ?
FROST-1840-2,254.888

- In my uniform . FROST-1840-2,254.889

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Did they see soldiers beside you ?
FROST-1840-2,254.890

- The soldiers were in a line behind me . FROST-1840-2,254.891

Can you state to a certainty , whether the mob must have seen the
soldiers , at the time they fired , as well as yourself ?
FROST-1840-2,254.892

- They must have seen the soldiers as well as myself .
FROST-1840-2,254.893

Did the windows go down to the ground ? FROST-1840-2,254.894

- They extended to the very floor of the house , all but a few inches .
FROST-1840-2,254.895

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> That is what you wanted ,
is it ? FROST-1840-2,254.896

<font> Foreman of the Jury . <$$font> It is , my Lord .
FROST-1840-2,254.897

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Will your Lordship have the goodness to
ask the witness this question : FROST-1840-2,254.898

after the shutters were taken down , when he supposes they were unmasked
, how many soldiers out of the 30 in the room received any wound ?
FROST-1840-2,254.899

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> You hear the question ,
Captain Gray ; FROST-1840-2,254.900

how many soldiers out of the 30 in the room received any wound after the
shutters were opened ? FROST-1840-2,254.901

- Only one . FROST-1840-2,254.902

Was that Serjeant Daily ? FROST-1840-2,254.903

- Serjeant Daily . FROST-1840-2,254.904

Did the mayor receive his wound after that time ? FROST-1840-2,254.905

- The mayor received a wound at the same time . FROST-1840-2,254.906

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I hope your Lordship will pursue this
inquiry ; FROST-1840-2,254.907

the mayor said , that he received his wound simultaneously .
FROST-1840-2,254.908

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Any question that you can
suggest , the Court will put . FROST-1840-2,254.909

<heading>

<font> Serjeant James Daily was called . <$$font> FROST-1840-2,254.911

<$$heading>

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> My Lord , Serjeant Daily is described
thus , " A Serjeant in Her Majesty's 45th regiment of foot , abiding at
the barracks at Pillgwenlly , in the parish of St. Woollos , in the
<P_255> borough of Newport , in the county of Monmouth . "
FROST-1840-2,255.913

I propose to examine him , my Lord , on the <font> voir_dire . <$$font>
FROST-1840-2,255.914

<bracket> <font> The witness was sworn upon the <$$font> voir_dire .
<$$bracket> FROST-1840-2,255.915

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I wish to know which of these two is
the correct description of you : " James Daily , a serjeant in Her
Majesty's 45th regiment of foot , abiding at the Newport poor-house ; "
or " James Daily , a serjeant in Her Majesty's 45th regiment of foot ,
abiding at the barrack at Pillgwenlly ? " FROST-1840-2,255.916

- At the poor-house . FROST-1840-2,255.917

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> We had a second list sent with that
alteration . FROST-1840-2,255.918

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Where has your company been
stationed for some time past ? FROST-1840-2,255.919

- They have been stationed , ever since they arrived at Newport , at the
union poor-house . FROST-1840-2,255.920

How long is it since they arrived at Newport ? FROST-1840-2,255.921

- I am not certain of the date ; FROST-1840-2,255.922

more than three months . FROST-1840-2,255.923

How has that union poor-house been fitted up for your reception ?
FROST-1840-2,255.924

- It has been fitted up in temporary order as a barrack-room .
FROST-1840-2,255.925

Have the whole company been stationed there ? FROST-1840-2,255.926

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,255.927

Are there any other barracks besides where your company is stationed ?
FROST-1840-2,255.928

- Our company are stationed all together . FROST-1840-2,255.929

Are there any others in Newport ? FROST-1840-2,255.930

- The company that I belong to are stationed at the poor-house barracks
, FROST-1840-2,255.931

and have been so ever since they arrived at Newport .
FROST-1840-2,255.932

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> There is no objection as to
this being in the parish of St. Woollos . FROST-1840-2,255.933

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> None at all . FROST-1840-2,255.934

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> It is not disputed that this is
in the parish of St. Woollos , in the borough of Newport .
FROST-1840-2,255.935

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Is this called Pill ?
FROST-1840-2,255.936

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Is this district called Pill ,
or Pillgwenlly ? FROST-1840-2,255.937

- I am not certain . FROST-1840-2,255.938

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general . <$$font> It is called Pillgwenlly in
the printed list , FROST-1840-2,255.939

and the boy proved that Pillgwenlly was called Pill .
FROST-1840-2,255.940

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Is this barrack in Pillgwenlly ?
FROST-1840-2,255.941

- Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> No . FROST-1840-2,255.942

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> It appeared to me that it was on the
other side of the town . FROST-1840-2,255.943

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> It is not quite on the other side of
the town , FROST-1840-2,255.944

but it is a long way beyond the Court-y-bella machine-house .
FROST-1840-2,255.945

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> You must ask somebody who
is acquainted with the situation of Pillgwenlly . FROST-1840-2,255.946

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Where is it that your company
is stationed ? FROST-1840-2,255.947

- It is stationed at the poor-house , at the top of Stowe-hill .
FROST-1840-2,255.948

The whole company is stationed there ? FROST-1840-2,255.949

- The whole company . FROST-1840-2,255.950

Do you know Pillgwenlly ? FROST-1840-2,255.951

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,255.952

<P_256>

Do you know how far Pillgwenlly extends ? FROST-1840-2,256.954

- I do not . FROST-1840-2,256.955

Are there any barracks at Pillgwenlly ? FROST-1840-2,256.956

- There have been barracks fitted up there for a part of our regiment
that arrived there after the riot at Newport , where the mill formerly
was . FROST-1840-2,256.957

Were you ever stationed at those barracks ? FROST-1840-2,256.958

- Never . FROST-1840-2,256.959

How far are those barracks from the poor-house ? FROST-1840-2,256.960

- Near about a mile . FROST-1840-2,256.961

Are they all in the parish of St. Woollos ? FROST-1840-2,256.962

- I do not know . FROST-1840-2,256.963

Where was Lieutenant Gray quartered ? FROST-1840-2,256.964

- He was quartered in Newport . FROST-1840-2,256.965

Where was he quartered on the 4th of November ? FROST-1840-2,256.966

- He was quartered in the town of Newport . FROST-1840-2,256.967

He had lodgings there ? FROST-1840-2,256.968

- He had lodgings there . FROST-1840-2,256.969

On the 4th of November , were there any men of your company at Newport ,
except those that were in the poor-house ? FROST-1840-2,256.970

- There was a party ordered down to go to the Westgate Inn , 28 privates
and two serjeants , under Lieutenant Gray . FROST-1840-2,256.971

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I am afraid I must stop this , or I
shall be supposed not to be objecting to the witness .
FROST-1840-2,256.972

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> We are still upon the <font>
voir_dire . <$$font> FROST-1840-2,256.973

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> At present , it seems that
there is a description given of the barracks as being at Pillgwenlly ;
FROST-1840-2,256.974

and it would seem from this witness's evidence that there is not only
the place called the union poor-house , in which the troops have been
quartered , but that some of this very regiment have been quartered in a
place which was fitted up as barracks at Pillgwenlly .
FROST-1840-2,256.975

Therefore , this description was rather calculated to mislead , because
it says that they ought to find him at Pillgwenlly , whereas , in fact ,
they ought to find him at the other place . FROST-1840-2,256.976

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> It seems to come to this , that
at the time when the notice was given , which is the time we are to look
to , there was a barrack in the union poor-house , FROST-1840-2,256.977

and there appears likewise to have been a barrack at Pillgwenlly ;
FROST-1840-2,256.978

now , the witness , it would appear , was of that division stationed in
the poor-house , and not of that stationed at Pillgwenlly .
FROST-1840-2,256.979

Those are the facts ; FROST-1840-2,256.980

but both the barracks are in the parish of St. Woollos and in the
borough of Monmouth . FROST-1840-2,256.981

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> He was not abiding in the barracks
at Pillgwenlly . FROST-1840-2,256.982

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> And this description sent
them there to look for him . FROST-1840-2,256.983

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> He was not abiding at the
barracks at Pillgwenlly , FROST-1840-2,256.984

he was stationed at the union poor-house . FROST-1840-2,256.985

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> It is over particular .
FROST-1840-2,256.986

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> Then it will come to this ,
whether that over_particularity may or may not be rejected , because ,
if it may , there is enough here , because he is described as of the
<P_257> 45th regiment , " in the parish of St. Woollos , in the borough
of Newport . " FROST-1840-2,257.987

But if your Lordship thinks , as this particular description is
erroneous , that is a sufficient objection , the moment your Lordship
intimates that , of course I withdraw the witness .
FROST-1840-2,257.988

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> I think the
over-particularity might mislead . FROST-1840-2,257.989

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> That is quite enough .
FROST-1840-2,257.990

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> The description is inaccurate .

Where do you live ? FROST-1840-2,257.996

Do you remember the Sunday evening , the 3d of November last ?
FROST-1840-2,257.998

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,257.999

Were you a special constable ? FROST-1840-2,257.1000

- The mayor's . FROST-1840-2,257.1005

Sir Thomas Phillips ? FROST-1840-2,257.1006

- Sir Thomas Phillips . FROST-1840-2,257.1007

At what time in the evening did you set off ? FROST-1840-2,257.1008

- Ten o'clock . FROST-1840-2,257.1009

Had you gone out before that , FROST-1840-2,257.1010

or was that the first time ? FROST-1840-2,257.1011

- That was the first time . FROST-1840-2,257.1012

Were you on horseback ? FROST-1840-2,257.1013

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,257.1014

What road did you take ? FROST-1840-2,257.1015

- Towards Risca . FROST-1840-2,257.1016

Did any one go with you ? FROST-1840-2,257.1017

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,257.1018

Who was he ? FROST-1840-2,257.1019

- A man named Richard Webb . FROST-1840-2,257.1020

On your road to Risca did you meet any persons ? FROST-1840-2,257.1021

- I went through a party standing on the roadside .
FROST-1840-2,257.1022

How far were you from Newport when you went through that party of men ?
FROST-1840-2,257.1023

- Three miles and a half . FROST-1840-2,257.1024

Is there any name to the place where you saw those men ?
FROST-1840-2,257.1025

- Rigby's , they call it . FROST-1840-2,257.1026

How many men were there ? FROST-1840-2,257.1027

- There may have been a_dozen or two . FROST-1840-2,257.1028

What were they doing ? FROST-1840-2,257.1029

- Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I do not see how my learned friend
can make this evidence . FROST-1840-2,257.1030

There is no connexion whatever between the prisoner at the bar and this
transaction . FROST-1840-2,257.1031

For any thing that has been even opened , certainly for any thing that
has been proved , or that appears likely to be proved , this may have
been a mere insulated matter , possibly a matter of accident .
FROST-1840-2,257.1032

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> At present he has proved nothing
that is material , FROST-1840-2,257.1033

and I do not see how we can reject the evidence . FROST-1840-2,257.1034

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> The question is as to the number of
persons collected together . FROST-1840-2,257.1035

It may be very immaterial , FROST-1840-2,257.1036

but , recollecting what use is sometimes made of evidence , I do not
like to <P_258> see a number of immaterial things collected together ,
for the purpose of being used in argument hereafter , for purposes of
which I am ignorant . FROST-1840-2,258.1037

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> It is in evidence , that in
the course of that night this man was sent out from Newport , for the
purpose of making inquiry as to what the state of the country was , at a
time shortly preceding the arrival of these persons at Newport .
FROST-1840-2,258.1038

I can@ @not stop that . FROST-1840-2,258.1039

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Suppose the answer to the next
question was , that the men were armed , FROST-1840-2,258.1040

you could not say that was immaterial ? FROST-1840-2,258.1041

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Perhaps your Lordship has not adverted to
the second branch of the question , which is , " What were they doing ?
" FROST-1840-2,258.1042

Suppose they were committing murder ? FROST-1840-2,258.1043

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> It may turn out that the answer may
make the question wholly irrelevant ; FROST-1840-2,258.1044

it may make it relevant . FROST-1840-2,258.1045

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> It may turn out so ; FROST-1840-2,258.1046

but it is for the purpose of preventing an irrelevant answer that we
object to the question . FROST-1840-2,258.1047

We say that , at present , the acts of the twelve men , or whatever the
number were , who were assembled on the Sunday evening at the time
alluded to by the witness - that those acts , whatever they may have
been , are not evidence against the prisoner at the bar , unless he is
proved to have been present , and unless he is , by previous evidence ,
directly connected with them . FROST-1840-2,258.1048

I quite agree that , so far as your Lordships' minds are concerned ,
whatever the answer may be , it is altogether immaterial ;
FROST-1840-2,258.1049

but I can@ @not admit that it is so , considering the other part of the
tribunal before which this cause is conducted . FROST-1840-2,258.1050

Who shall say what is to be the effect in a long trial lasting several
days , of any acts given in evidence , by a body of men , upon the minds
of the jury ? FROST-1840-2,258.1051

It may be calculated to produce a very serious effect upon their minds ,
though your Lordships may afterwards consider that it has no bearing
upon the case at all ; FROST-1840-2,258.1052

I apprehend in a case of this kind it is necessary to connect
individuals who are supposed to have done any acts whatever with the
prisoner at the bar , before those acts can be given in evidence ;
FROST-1840-2,258.1053

and , therefore , I object to the question as to what those twelve men
on the Sunday evening were doing . FROST-1840-2,258.1054

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Let us hear in what
direction this was . FROST-1840-2,258.1055

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> He said that he went in the
direction of Risca . FROST-1840-2,258.1056

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Is that in the direction
from which , on the following morning , those persons came to Newport ?
FROST-1840-2,258.1057

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> It is . FROST-1840-2,258.1058

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> Ask that question .
FROST-1840-2,258.1059

Mr. <font> Wightman . <$$font> Is that the road to the hills from
Newport ? FROST-1840-2,258.1060

- It is . FROST-1840-2,258.1061

<P_259>

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> It comes by Court-y-bella .
FROST-1840-2,259.1063

Mr. <font> Wightman . <$$font> Is it beyond Court-y-bella ?
FROST-1840-2,259.1064

- It is . FROST-1840-2,259.1065

Is it upon the high road ? FROST-1840-2,259.1066

- It is upon the same tram-road . FROST-1840-2,259.1067

Does Court-y-bella stand between Risca and Newport ?
FROST-1840-2,259.1068

- By the tram-road it does . FROST-1840-2,259.1069

Do you know the Cefn ? FROST-1840-2,259.1070

- I do . FROST-1840-2,259.1071

Is the Cefn upon the road between Newport and Risca ?
FROST-1840-2,259.1072

- Yes , it is . FROST-1840-2,259.1073

Do you know a place called the Welch Oak ? FROST-1840-2,259.1074

- Yes , I do . FROST-1840-2,259.1075

Is that between Risca and Cefn ? FROST-1840-2,259.1076

- Yes , it is . FROST-1840-2,259.1077

Does the tram-road , of which you have been speaking , pass by Tredegar
Park ? FROST-1840-2,259.1078

- It does ; FROST-1840-2,259.1079

it goes through Tredegar Park . FROST-1840-2,259.1080

You saw 12 persons or more , you say , on the road ;
FROST-1840-2,259.1081

I want to know what they were doing ? FROST-1840-2,259.1082

- Standing under a wall . FROST-1840-2,259.1083

Did you see whether they had any thing in their hands or not ?
FROST-1840-2,259.1084

- I could not see so plain as that ; FROST-1840-2,259.1085

it was dark . FROST-1840-2,259.1086

Did you pass on ? FROST-1840-2,259.1087

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,259.1088

Did you go by the Cefn ? FROST-1840-2,259.1089

- I had passed the Cefn then . FROST-1840-2,259.1090

Did you go on to the Welch Oak ? FROST-1840-2,259.1091

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,259.1092

Did you pass that ? FROST-1840-2,259.1093

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,259.1094

Did you get on as far as Risca ? FROST-1840-2,259.1095

- Yes , I went very near Risca . FROST-1840-2,259.1096

When you got near Risca , did you hear any thing ?
FROST-1840-2,259.1097

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> My Lord , I object to that question .
FROST-1840-2,259.1098

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> We are not going to ask as to
conversations ; FROST-1840-2,259.1099

we will vary the form of the question . FROST-1840-2,259.1100

Mr. <font> Wightman . <$$font> Did you hear any noise , any sound ?
FROST-1840-2,259.1101

Mr. <font> Attorney-general . <$$font> It is the anxiety to avoid a
leading question that induces my learned friend to put it in that shape
. FROST-1840-2,259.1102

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I attended to my learned friend's
opening , FROST-1840-2,259.1103

and I must be quite aware of what this is , FROST-1840-2,259.1104

and of course I am anxious to shut out that which I feel , upon the
authority that I hold in my hand , is not evidence against Mr. Frost .
FROST-1840-2,259.1105

I am not capable of doing much more than referring to the authority .
FROST-1840-2,259.1106

It is a case in Roscoe's Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases
, page 59 . FROST-1840-2,259.1107

" Similar evidence was lately admitted in a case of robbery .
FROST-1840-2,259.1108

The prisoner came with a mob to the prosecutor's house ,
FROST-1840-2,259.1109

and one of the mob went up to the prosecutor , FROST-1840-2,259.1110

and civilly , and , as he believed , with a good intention , advised him
to give them something to get rid of them , which he did .
FROST-1840-2,259.1111

To show that this was not <font> bonâ_fide <$$font> advice to the
prosecutor , but in reality a mode of robbing him , it was proposed to
give evidence of other demands of money made by the same mob at other
houses at different periods of the day , when some of the prisoners were
present . FROST-1840-2,259.1112

Parke , Justice , having conferred with Vaughan , Baron , and Alderson ,
said , ' We are of opinion that what was done by the mob before and
after the particular transaction at the prosecutor's <P_260> house , but
in the course of the same day , and when any of the prisoners were
present , may be given in evidence . ' " FROST-1840-2,260.1113

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> That was upon the special commission
at Winchester . FROST-1840-2,260.1114

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> That was an indictment for
a robbery . FROST-1840-2,260.1115

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> The mob went about the country
robbing different people . FROST-1840-2,260.1116

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> And there the acts of the mob
elsewhere were not allowed to be given in evidence with a view of
showing their intention , unless they could show that some of the
prisoners were present . FROST-1840-2,260.1117

This is not an indictment against Mr. Frost for conspiracy .
FROST-1840-2,260.1118

But suppose it were an indictment for a conspiracy , where you may
almost prove any thing , and then apply the evidence afterwards ;
FROST-1840-2,260.1119

still , even in that case , where a number of persons are indicted for
conspiracy , if you propose to give any evidence against any body ,
however little it may affect the person immediately under trial , you
must show that it immediately affects somebody concerned in the
conspiracy . FROST-1840-2,260.1120

Now here a certain number of persons are supposed to be standing under a
wall ; FROST-1840-2,260.1121

the night is so dark that it can@ @not be seen whether they had any
thing in their hands , FROST-1840-2,260.1122

and it is supposed FROST-1840-2,260.1123

<paren> for one must not disguise the fact ; FROST-1840-2,260.1124

it is in that way only I can argue it <$$paren> , FROST-1840-2,260.1125

it is supposed , that because somebody fired a shot by which the witness
was wounded , that that may be legitimately given in evidence against
Mr. Frost ; as if no shot could be fired that night in any direction
towards the hills , without Mr. Frost having some connexion with it ;
and this without any evidence whatever that any one of the parties
present at the firing of that gun was connected at all with Mr. Frost ,
or was a person with whom Mr. Frost had had any communication .
FROST-1840-2,260.1126

Any thing of that sort might have happened ; FROST-1840-2,260.1127

in short , any damage might have been done by any body -
FROST-1840-2,260.1128

Mr. <font> Wightman . <$$font> That is not what I am going to ask him
about at present . FROST-1840-2,260.1129

Mr. Justice <font> Williams . <$$font> The question was not as to a
shot , but as to a sound . FROST-1840-2,260.1130

Sir <font> F. Pollock . <$$font> I believe that the sound was the
sound of a pistol , and that then he found himself wounded .
FROST-1840-2,260.1131

Mr. <font> Wightman . <$$font> No ; you had better wait till you hear
the answer . FROST-1840-2,260.1132

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> I think you can@ @not object to the
question , because a legitimate answer may be given to it ;
FROST-1840-2,260.1133

suppose the answer was that he saw a number of men there armed , or a
number of men being drilled , FROST-1840-2,260.1134

why , this is the very quarter from which the party came the following
morning , FROST-1840-2,260.1135

and that would be legitimate evidence . FROST-1840-2,260.1136

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> As it does not appear that either Mr.
Frost , the <P_261> prisoner , was present , or that any one of the
persons who composed the multitude of the 4th of November was present ;
but for aught that appears to the contrary , this may have been a body
of men totally distinct from and unknown to every one of the individuals
composing the multitude of the 4th of November , and totally unconnected
with and unknown to Mr. Frost ; FROST-1840-2,261.1137

I beg to ask upon what principle at all authorized by law can any thing
said or done by these people be evidence against Mr. Frost ?
FROST-1840-2,261.1138

In order to show the danger of this evidence until Mr. Frost or some of
the mob of which he is supposed to have been a member on the 4th of
November are connected with this particular meeting of persons , let me
just suppose this , that in answer to the question put by my learned
friend as to what he heard , the witness were to answer , that he heard
one of them say , " We are marching to London for the purpose of
deposing the Queen , " FROST-1840-2,261.1139

is it to be pretended that a declaration of that kind -
FROST-1840-2,261.1140

<paren> for a declaration in a matter of high treason is an act done ,
FROST-1840-2,261.1141

it is evidence of a compassing , FROST-1840-2,261.1142

and would be an overt act <$$paren> - FROST-1840-2,261.1143

is it to be pretended that an act of that kind , or indeed any act done
by any body of persons not proved to have been even known to or seen by
the prisoner at the bar , is to be used upon his trial against him ?
FROST-1840-2,261.1144

Now , suppose some such answer were to come out , FROST-1840-2,261.1145

how is it possible for your Lordships , with the utmost care and desire
to exclude irrelevant matter , to divest the minds of the jury of the
effect of such an answer ? FROST-1840-2,261.1146

My Lord , I apprehend that upon the very clearest principles nothing
done or said by a body of persons of whom the prisoner is not proved to
have been one , and to which he is not proved directly or indirectly to
be at all a party , can be admissible in evidence against him .
FROST-1840-2,261.1147

Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Tindal . <$$font> I think we have a right to
see how this large body of men were collected . FROST-1840-2,261.1148

The evidence might show that upon the very same road by which the
multitude arrived in the morning a large number of men on the preceding
night were found in such a part of the road , and another party upon
another part of the road , and that they met together at a certain place
to proceed for a general purpose ; FROST-1840-2,261.1149

I think the question is clearly admissible . FROST-1840-2,261.1150

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> It is impossible to exclude this
evidence . FROST-1840-2,261.1151

The prisoner will not be affected by it unless there is some evidence
afterwards to show that he was a party to it . FROST-1840-2,261.1152

But you must go by steps ; FROST-1840-2,261.1153

I think they may certainly prove that at an early period of the night a
number of persons armed were assembled in different parts of the country
, who were to be with the prisoner in the morning ;
FROST-1840-2,261.1154

that is clearly legitimate evidence ; FROST-1840-2,261.1155

and supposing this witness proves that they fired upon him , that is
another fact from which it may be subsequently collected that there was
an armed force occupying that district , <P_262> which he afterwards
commanded and directed . FROST-1840-2,262.1156

It is clearly admissible evidence . FROST-1840-2,262.1157

Mr. Justice <font> Williams . <$$font> Supposing this body of men had
been brought nearer in point of time , and nearer in point of distance
to the transactions at Newport , there could have been no question then
that this was admissible evidence . FROST-1840-2,262.1158

Then the only difference is that it is more remote in distance and more
remote in time ; FROST-1840-2,262.1159

but what difference does that make , except that the evidence is weaker
? FROST-1840-2,262.1160

I am totally at a loss to discover , in point of legal principle , as to
the question of admissibility , what distinction there can be .
FROST-1840-2,262.1161

The evidence may be weaker - FROST-1840-2,262.1162

it may prove less - FROST-1840-2,262.1163

but the state of the country that night and about that time is some
proof , so far as it goes , tending to throw some light upon what
occurred at that point of time ; FROST-1840-2,262.1164

I admit not very near , and therefore just in that proportion more weak
. FROST-1840-2,262.1165

Mr. <font> Wightman . <$$font> About how far is Risca from Newport ?
FROST-1840-2,262.1166

- About six miles . FROST-1840-2,262.1167

When you got near to Risca , did you hear any noise ?
FROST-1840-2,262.1168

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,262.1169

What was that noise ? FROST-1840-2,262.1170

- I heard cheering , FROST-1840-2,262.1171

and I heard a gun fire . FROST-1840-2,262.1172

About what o'clock would that be ? FROST-1840-2,262.1173

- I should think it was past eleven . FROST-1840-2,262.1174

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> He is not now speaking of the twelve
men . FROST-1840-2,262.1175

Mr. <font> Wightman . <$$font> No ; he saw the twelve men about three
miles from Newport ; FROST-1840-2,262.1176

he is now about six . FROST-1840-2,262.1177

- Did the cheering appear to you to be from one or more persons ?
FROST-1840-2,262.1178

- It seemed to come from a good many . FROST-1840-2,262.1179

How far were you beyond the place called the Welch Oak ?
FROST-1840-2,262.1180

- About a mile , I should think . FROST-1840-2,262.1181

Towards Risca ? FROST-1840-2,262.1182

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,262.1183

In what direction did the sound appear to you to be ?
FROST-1840-2,262.1184

- From up the hills above Risca bridge . FROST-1840-2,262.1185

When you heard this , did you go on , FROST-1840-2,262.1186

or did you return ? FROST-1840-2,262.1187

- I returned . FROST-1840-2,262.1188

What sort of a night was it at this time ? FROST-1840-2,262.1189

- Raining , and very dark . FROST-1840-2,262.1190

On your way back , when you got to Rigby's , the place you have spoken
of , did you see any persons ? FROST-1840-2,262.1191

- Yes . FROST-1840-2,262.1192

About what time would it be when you got to Rigby's the second time , in
coming back ? FROST-1840-2,262.1193

- I should think about twelve . FROST-1840-2,262.1194

Tell us what you saw there ? FROST-1840-2,262.1195

- The men tried to stop me , FROST-1840-2,262.1196

and stabbed me . FROST-1840-2,262.1197

Mr. <font> Kelly . <$$font> Does your Lordship think this evidence
also ? FROST-1840-2,262.1198

Mr. Baron <font> Parke . <$$font> Yes ; I do not see how we can reject
it . FROST-1840-2,262.1199

Mr. <font> Wightman . <$$font> When you got to Rigby's , tell us what
you saw ? FROST-1840-2,262.1200

- The men tried to stop me , FROST-1840-2,262.1201

and struck me with something in the thigh . FROST-1840-2,262.1202

Where was that ? FROST-1840-2,262.1203

- At Rigby's , in the road . FROST-1840-2,262.1204

<P_263>

What number of men ? FROST-1840-2,263.1206

- About sixteen , I should think then . FROST-1840-2,263.1207

How were they standing ? FROST-1840-2,263.1208

- Across the road . FROST-1840-2,263.1209

Were they in a line ? FROST-1840-2,263.1210

- Yes , I should think they were . FROST-1840-2,263.1211

parties of men collected , some of whom were armed , in the direction
from which those persons came in the morning . FROST-1840-2,263.1257
