The <font> Accomptant's Pocket Companion . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,1.4

<$$heading>

No Man can pretend to enter upon Business , before he rightly
understands a distinct Method of keeping his Accompts in such Order , as
at any Time he can satisfy himself and every Person with whom he trades
, how the State of Affairs stands betwixt them . Also , how he has
disposed of such Goods , Houses , Ships , or other Effects , which he
had either purchased , or were left to him : Whereby he knows to whom he
is Debtor , or who are Debtors to him . DRUMMOND-1718-1,1.6

The Words <font> Debtor <$$font> and <font> Creditor <$$font> , being so
well understood by the very meanest in every civil Society , it is not
worth while to give their Etymology , and scarce to tell , that by
<font> Debtor <$$font> , is meant the Person owing , and by <font>
Creditor <$$font> the Person to whom he owes , or who gives him Credit .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,1.7

<P_2>

<font> Merchant-Accompts <$$font> being a Branch of the Mathematicks ,
are so much improved , that a perfect Knowledge of them is almost become
a Science , because every Thing terminates in a clear Demonstration .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,2.9

If therefore a Man , by Practice , makes himself Master of keeping his
Accompts fair , by giving every Accompt the proper Title , and making
every such Accompt justly Debtor or Creditor where it ought to be ; he
himself at any Time can adjust or ballance every Accompt :
DRUMMOND-1718-1,2.10

And in Case of Death , his Friends or Creditors will find no Difficulty
in it : So that his Family can@ @not suffer ; and his Character of
having been an exact Man , will remain after him , to the great
Satisfaction of his Posterity . DRUMMOND-1718-1,2.11

There is no Manner of Mystery in keeping clear Accompts , tho every Man
frames a Method to himself , according to the Nature of his Trade ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,2.12

yet all must in the End exactly ballance , if you observe to charge the
proper Debtors , and discharge the proper Creditors .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,2.13

First , When a Man launches out into Trade , he is to make a just
Inventary {COM:sic} of his Stock , such as <font> Money , Goods , Houses
, Land-Estate , Ships <$$font> and <font> Debts <$$font> owing to him ,
either in Accompt by Bond , Bill , or other Security .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,2.14

And in Regard Men of Business are presumed to owe to others , and that
their real Estate is not what is contained in the above Inventary
{COM:sic} , but what remains after Deduction of the Debts which he owes
: Therefore these Debts must be carried in to your Books immediately
following the Inventary {COM:sic} . DRUMMOND-1718-1,2.15

To guide you in forming this <font> Inventary {COM:sic} <$$font> , your
<font> ready Money <$$font> comes first in View , DRUMMOND-1718-1,2.16

and naturally is the first Article . DRUMMOND-1718-1,2.17

You are to notice in what Town , what Place of the Town , and what Part
of any Building your <font> Houses <$$font> are , valuing them <P_3> as
they cost ; or , according to the Estimate put on them .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.18

If you have more as one in a Town , keep the Prices of each within the
Line , DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.19

and extend the Value of all to the out Column . DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.20

You are to give the Name of , and Place where your <font> Land-Estate
<$$font> lies , valuing it at the Number of Years purchase it is worth .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.21

Neither will it at all be amiss if you insert a general Abstract of the
<font> Rent-Roll . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.22

Such <font> Goods <$$font> as are sold by Weight , and contained in Cask
, Bales , &c. notice the Numbers of such Cask , &c. wherein they are
contained , the gross Weight of Goods and Cask , and the nett Weight ,
which is the Remainder , after the Tare <paren> or Weight of the Cask
<$$paren> is subtracted from the Gross . DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.23

All Cask , Bales , Packs , &c. ought to be numbered .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.24

Goods sold by Measure must have the Number , Pieces , and Measure of
each Piece . DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.25

In all other Goods , notice the Quantity ; after which the Value , as
they cost . DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.26

Some in their Inventary {COM:sic} value Goods as they do desire to sell
them ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.27

but I know no Reason for this , but to make a Man appear rich by his
Inventary {COM:sic} , and , at ballancing , his Gain appear little .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.28

You are to name your <font> Ships <$$font> , their Burden and Value , as
they cost , Reparations included . DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.29

In <font> Debts <$$font> due to you , add to the Person's Name the
Nature of the Debt , the Tenor of the Obligation , the Time when payable
, and the Sum due ; and just so by Debts which you owe .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,3.30

To <font> Journalize <$$font> all the Branches of your Inventary
{COM:sic} , by giving each Accompt a proper Title : <font> Ready Money
<$$font> is commonly exprest by the Word <bracket> Cash <$$bracket>
<P_4> which is derived <paren> as Mr. <font> Colinson <$$font> rightly
observes <$$paren> from the <font> Italian <$$font> Word <bracket> Cassa
<$$bracket> a Chest ; whence we make that Chest in which our Money is ,
<font> Debtor <$$font> for what Sums we receive and put into it ; and
<font> Creditor <$$font> , by what Sums we take out , and pay from it .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,4.31

<font> Houses , Land-Estate , Goods <$$font> , and <font> Persons
<$$font> owing you , are Debtors , by the Title under which they go .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,4.32

And because every <font> Debtor <$$font> must have a <font> Creditor
<$$font> , we give the Word <bracket> Stock <$$bracket> Credit by each
of the above Accompts , DRUMMOND-1718-1,4.33

and make it <font> Debtor <$$font> to every Man to whom we owe .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,4.34

Thus having finished your Inventary {COM:sic} , it will be of great Use
and Ease to you to keep a <font> Ware-House-Book <$$font> , which saves
the Trouble of giving every little Sale of Goods , a Post in your <font>
Journal <$$font> and <font> Leger . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,4.35

Open this Book with both Sides in View : DRUMMOND-1718-1,4.36

Upon the Top , for a Title , you name the <font> Goods <$$font> , and
<font> Ware-House <$$font> or <font> Cellar <$$font> where they ly ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,4.37

upon both Sides you have a Column for the Date . DRUMMOND-1718-1,4.38

On the Left_hand side keep an Accompt of such Goods you receive in ; 1st
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Day , 2d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Person from whom , the Ship or
Place from whence , 3d {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Number
and Quantity of the Goods received . DRUMMOND-1718-1,4.39

On the opposite Side you accompt for the Disposal of them ; 1st
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Date , 2d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Method of Disposal , either for
ready Money to Persons , or ship'd off for Adventures , 3d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Numbers and Quantities so
disposed of . DRUMMOND-1718-1,4.40

When you see by the <font> Ware-house-Book <$$font> what Goods are
disposed of for ready Money , you are to make <font> Cash <$$font>
Debitor for that Sum , and give the Accompt which goes under the Title
of these Goods Credit for the Quantity sold , and the Value sold for .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,4.41

<P_5>

What you sell to any Man , you must charge to his Accompt , giving the
Goods Credit therefore ; and just so , when you ship them for Adventures
. DRUMMOND-1718-1,5.43

At ballancing this Book , you see what Goods are on hand .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,5.44

Because there are Charges which must necessarily {TEXT:necessarly} be
laid out upon Goods ; it is very proper you keep a Book of <font>
Incident Charges <$$font> , wherein you are to take the Day when , and
every particular Sum paid upon such Goods : All which being added when
the whole Sale is made , comes as a Charge upon the Goods .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,5.45

Next proceed to minute every Transaction of your Trade in the <font>
Memorial <$$font> or <font> Waste-book <$$font> , in a very distinct
Stile , yet couching the Narrative in as few Words as reasonably you can
. DRUMMOND-1718-1,5.46

Observe to make all Additions or Substractions in a Column or Columns
within the Out-Column , that you may carry the real Sum to be debited or
credited distinctly out , which not only gives you easy journalizing ,
but the different Columns make a handsome and beautifull Post .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,5.47

If no Man is concerned with you in any Branch of Trade , you keep only
<font> Proper Accompts . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,5.48

If you sell a Parcel of Goods for ready Money , I. Write in the
Memorial , 1st {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Date of Sale .
2d {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Quality of the Goods . 3d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Numbers of Cask , Bales ,
Pieces , <font> &c. <$$font> 4th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} ,
The Quantity sold . 5th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Price
sold for . <paren> as so much <font> per Lib. Ell <$$font> , &c.
<$$paren> DRUMMOND-1718-1,5.49

And 6th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , Extend the Sum to the
outward Money Column . DRUMMOND-1718-1,5.50

<P_6>

In the Purchase or Sale of Goods , the Name of them is the Title of the
Accompt , either as <font> Debtor <$$font> or <font> Creditor <$$font> :
Because , tho , when I buy Goods from any Man , I am , properly speaking
, Debtor to that Man , yet the Consideration of that Debt being for
these Goods ; I make the Goods Debtor to him , and give them Credit for
every Sale made of them . DRUMMOND-1718-1,6.52

So at balancing the Accompt of Goods , I find what I have gain'd or lost
upon such a Commodity , Whence you naturally see when <font> Cash
<$$font> is <font> Debitor <$$font> , the <font> Goods <$$font> so sold
must be <font> Creditor <$$font> by <font> Cash . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,6.53

II. Observe the same Method to minute buying of Goods .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,6.54

And since <font> Cash <$$font> is <font> Debtor <$$font> for the Sum I
receive for Goods sold , and these <font> Goods Creditor : <$$font> By
the same Parity of Reason , <font> Goods <$$font> bought for <font>
Ready Money <$$font> are <font> Debtor <$$font> and <font> Cash Creditor
<$$font> for the Sum paid therefore . DRUMMOND-1718-1,6.55

III. Selling <font> Goods upon Time <$$font> , minute the Bargain , 1st
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} The Quality , 2d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Quantity . 3d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Price sold for . 4th
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Time when payable .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,6.56

And 5th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , Extend the Sum .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,6.57

To give the proper <font> Debtor <$$font> and <font> Creditor <$$font> ,
you@ @'ll {TEXT:'l} consider , by what I said before , the <font> Person
buying <$$font> being <font> Debtor <$$font> , DRUMMOND-1718-1,6.58

I devolve my Right upon the <font> Goods <$$font> which now become
<font> Creditor . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,6.59

When you buy <font> Goods <$$font> you only reverse the <font> Debtors
<$$font> and <font> Creditors . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,6.60

IV. When you sell <font> Goods <$$font> in the way of <font> Barter
<$$font> , <paren> that is , I give one Commodity for another <$$paren>
after narrating the Transaction and extending the Sum , which is the
Value of the Goods so exchanged ; You plainly see <font> Goods received
are Debtor <$$font> , and the <font> Goods delivered Creditor .
<$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,6.61

In Cases of buying you still change the <font> Debtors <$$font> and
<font> Creditors . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,6.62

<P_7>

V. You sell Goods . Part for Cash . - for another Man's Obligation
assign'd to you ; - for Goods in Barter . - payable in Time .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,7.64

Minute the Transaction by the following Example , DRUMMOND-1718-1,7.65

29th {COM:font_change_excludes_numerals} May . DRUMMOND-1718-1,7.66

Sold to <font> John Dickinson <$$font> 56000 Weight Iron , at 2 <font>
Pence per l. <$$font> For which received in Cash , - <font> L.

<font> To Journalize , this Post . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,7.73

<$$heading>

<font> Cash <$$font> - <font> Debtor L. <$$font> 66 13 4 <font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,7.75

Thomas Davidson <$$font> - <font> Debtor <$$font> 100
DRUMMOND-1718-1,7.76

Wheat 400 Bolls - <font> Debtor <$$font> 200 DRUMMOND-1718-1,7.77

<font> John Dickinson <$$font> - <font> Debtor <$$font> 100
DRUMMOND-1718-1,7.78

<font> L. <$$font> 466 13 4 DRUMMOND-1718-1,7.79

Iron - <font> Creditor <$$font> - 466 13 4 DRUMMOND-1718-1,7.80

Had <font> John Dickinson <$$font> only indorsed <font> Davidson
<$$font> 's Bill to me , or given me Precept on him , I shou'd make
{TEXT:made} <font> Dickinson <$$font> my Debtor , because it is Time
enough to give him Credit <P_8> when such Bill or Precept is paid ,
being only in a manner Security for a Sum , which if not paid , must
recur upon the Drawer or Indorser . DRUMMOND-1718-1,8.81

I. If your <font> Houses <$$font> are pull'd down or burnt , in regard
your Stock is diminished by their Value , the Title <font> Houses
<$$font> is <font> Creditor <$$font> by <font> Gain <$$font> and <font>
Loss . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,8.82

{COM:symbol_omitted}

N.B. The Words <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss <$$font> we make
the Name of an Accompt ; whereby at ballancing our Books we find how
much our Stock is increased or decreased since we commenced Trade .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,8.84

Therefore making that Title <font> Debtor <$$font> to every Accompt I
lose on , and <font> Creditor <$$font> by every Accompt I gain on , the
Difference betwixt the <font> Debtor <$$font> and <font> Creditor
<$$font> side , shows my nett <font> Gain <$$font> or <font> Loss
<$$font> ; that is , If the Sums on the <font> Debtor <$$font> side
being collected , do not amount to the Sums on the <font> Credit
<$$font> side ; so much as it takes to ballance or make up the Value of
the Sums on the opposite side , so much is my real Gain , and <font> è
contra . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,8.85

II. When I sell a <font> House <$$font> , 1st
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , For <font> ready Money <$$font> , I
give it Credit by <font> Cash . <$$font> 2d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , If upon Time , by the <font> Person
<$$font> to whom sold . 3d {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , If in
<font> Barter <$$font> , by the Goods or other Effects .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,8.86

4th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , If the Bargain is part Money ,
part on Time , part Barter , observe the preceeding Example on Goods ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,8.87

consequently each or any of these Titles is <font> Debtor <$$font> to
the <font> House <$$font> sold . DRUMMOND-1718-1,8.88

After the same manner in Buying , <font> mutatis mutandis . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,8.89

My <font> Land-Estate <$$font> being <font> Debtor <$$font> in the
Inventary {COM:sic} to <font> Stock <$$font> for the whole Value ; we
now come to find out the proper <font> Creditors . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,8.90

All the Branches in the <font> Rent-Roll <$$font> being the annual Gain
, my Estate is yearly so much better'd : DRUMMOND-1718-1,8.91

It would seem to follow , the Estate ought to be <font> Creditor
<$$font> by <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,8.92

Upon the <P_9> Main it is so : DRUMMOND-1718-1,9.93

Yet to be distinct in Accompting for this Estate , and to know how each
different Branch is dispos'd of , please notice . DRUMMOND-1718-1,9.94

I. Barley , Oats , Wheat , Meal , Kain and Eatables expended in the
Family , also Services imposed on the Tenants , are to give the Estate
Credit under the Title <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss <$$font> ,
because they are sunk so , as never to come in , to any other Accompt .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,9.95

II. If I sell any Part of the above Branches , <font> Cash <$$font> ,
the Person to whom , or Goods for which sold , gives <font> Credit
<$$font> to the Estate for the Value . DRUMMOND-1718-1,9.96

III. If any of the Tenants owes all or any part of what he ought to pay
, by his holding in the <font> Rent-Roll ; <$$font> it is evident they
become <font> Debtors <$$font> , and the Estate is <font> Creditor
<$$font> by them , classing them under the Title of <font> Out-Standing
Debts . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,9.97

In this Case , what Carriages or other Work-duties are not served for ,
must be charged in Money , according to the Value laid on them in the
Tenant's Tack . DRUMMOND-1718-1,9.98

Observe always , in the Accompt you keep with such Tenants , to
{TEXT:missing_"to"} be particular in narrating every Branch of the
Revenue , for which he thus becomes your <font> Debtor <$$font> , and in
accompting for Payments made by him , to give him <font> Credit <$$font>
after the same manner as any other Correspondent . DRUMMOND-1718-1,9.99

IV. Also give the Estate <font> Credit <$$font> by <font> Gain <$$font>
and <font> Loss <$$font> , for all Meliorations on the House , Gardens
and Out-Houses . V. And by every Sum received as Part of the Money
Rent , making <font> Cash Debtor <$$font> , and the <font> Estate
<$$font> <bracket> not every Tenant <$$bracket> Creditor , because it is
customary that the full of the Rent-Roll is paid in , every Year , tho'
at different Terms . DRUMMOND-1718-1,9.100

It will do well to carry in the Abstract after the following Method .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,9.101

<P_10>

29. May . DRUMMOND-1718-1,10.103

<font> L. <$$font> 198 DRUMMOND-1718-1,10.107

By what is said , <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss <$$font> is
<font> Debtor L. <$$font> 98 for family Expence .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,10.108

<font> Cash <$$font> is <font> Debtor L. <$$font> 100 , for so much
received . DRUMMOND-1718-1,10.109

And my Estate is <font> Creditor <$$font> by both <font> L. <$$font>
198 . DRUMMOND-1718-1,10.110

The Book which you clear with your Tenants by , may be in the following
Form . DRUMMOND-1718-1,10.111

On the left_Hand or Charge side , give 1st
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Man's Name . 2d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Room of Land he possesseth .
3d {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , Every Particular he is to pay .
And 4th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Silver Rent .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,10.112

<P_11>

John Thomson <font> in <$$font> Woodhead <font> Cropt <$$font> 1718
DRUMMOND-1718-1,11.114

{COM:table_omitted}

On the opposite side you have the same Columns with the Addition of one
for the Dates of each Payment he makes , which you are to collect at the
Term , when all the Payments ought to be complete ; whereby you see ,
upon which of the Branches he is owing any Part of his Rent .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,11.116

Therefore having prepared the Rent-Book for the succeeding Year , the
Rests come to be the first Article , as a Charge upon the Tenant in his
next Accompt . DRUMMOND-1718-1,11.117

These may guide a Merchant who has a Land-Estate ,
DRUMMOND-1718-1,11.118

I design hereafter a more full Discourse for the Aid of Chamberlains ,
and all other Officers about a Great Man's House , for their distinct
clearing with their Lords . DRUMMOND-1718-1,11.119

I. When you keep an open Accompt with a Man , you make him <font>
Debtor <$$font> to <font> Cash <$$font> , for what Money you pay to , or
for him , narrating for what such Payment is made . 2d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , For what Bills you remit or send
him . 3d {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , For what Goods or other
Effects you deliver or send him . DRUMMOND-1718-1,11.120

And he is Creditor , 1st {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , By Money .
2d {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , Remises . 3d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , By Goods you receive .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,11.121

<font> Ships <$$font> are <font> Debtor <$$font> or <font> Creditor
<$$font> the same way as Goods , <font> viz. Cash , Persons <$$font>
buying or selling , and Goods in Barter . DRUMMOND-1718-1,11.122

<font> Proper Adventures <$$font> you shall understand , when we come to
Accompts in Partnership . DRUMMOND-1718-1,11.123

<P_12>

You may keep an <font> Accompt <$$font> of <font> Interest <$$font> ,
which is <font> Debtor <$$font> to <font> Cash <$$font> for Annual rents
paid me , and <font> Creditor <$$font> by such Sums as I pay to any who
has my Obligation . DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.125

{COM:symbol_omitted}

N.B. If you deal not much in Bonds , you need not keep this Title in
your Books , DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.127

but sink it in Gain and Loss , DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.128

for there it must center at last . DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.129

That you may know your Expence , you make an Accompt of <font> Proper
Charges <$$font> , in which you class <paren> in separate Columns
<$$paren> Pocket Money , Diet , Lodging , Washing , Apparel , <font> &c.
<$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.130

This Accompt is <font> Debtor <$$font> to <font> Cash <$$font> for Money
paid , and to Persons to whom I owe upon these Accounts , or to <font>
Goods <$$font> given in Compensation of such Debts .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.131

It is <font> Creditor <$$font> by <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss
<$$font> , being so much of my Estate sunk for Living .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.132

<font> Bodomry <$$font> , is when a Sum is lent and no Security , save a
simple Bond given upon the Faith of the Arrival of a Ship at such a Port
, DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.133

and in regard , the Money is lost , if the Ship be cast away , there is
a valuable Consideration above the common Interest or Exchange .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.134

This being a Hazard or Wager upon the Ship's <font> Bodom <$$font> , we
give it the Title of <font> Bodomry Accompt <$$font> ,
DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.135

and is <font> Debtor <$$font> to <font> Goods , Cash <$$font> &c. for
the real Value of what I advance , and to Gain and Loss for the
Consideration allowed for the Credit I give . DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.136

If the Ship arrive safe , it is <font> Creditor <$$font> by <font> Cash
<$$font> or <font> Goods <$$font> , when I am paid upon her Arrival ;
and by <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss <$$font> , if she is cast
away . DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.137

You keep an Accompt with Ship-Masters after the same manner as with any
other of your Correspondents . DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.138

Your <font> Household {TEXT:Houshold} Furniture <$$font> is a Part of
your <font> Stock <$$font> , DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.139

that Title is <font> Debtor <$$font> to <font> Cash , Persons <$$font>
from whom , and <font> Goods <$$font> for which purchased , and <font>
Creditor <$$font> by <font> Ballance <$$font> , if still in Custody ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.140

then they become an Article in the next Inventary {COM:sic} , as do all
other Goods remaining on hand . DRUMMOND-1718-1,12.141

If all or any part are dispos'd of , it <P_13> is <font> Creditor
<$$font> by the Title of the Accompt for that Transaction .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,13.142

If you keep an Accompt of <font> House-Rent <$$font> , it is <font>
Debtor <$$font> to <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss <$$font> , for
what Money you receive for Rents . DRUMMOND-1718-1,13.143

<font> Family Expence <$$font> need no Title , being naturally sunk into
Gain and Loss . As are <font> Wagers , Failures {TEXT:Failziures}
<$$font> on Bargains , <font> &c. <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,13.144

therefore 't@ @is Time enough to carry them into your Books , when you
gain or lose by them . DRUMMOND-1718-1,13.145

Some People keep imaginary Accompts , such as <font> Delivery , Accompt
of Goods bought and sold <$$font> , which are really unnecessary .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,13.146

If you want to know what you make on the Provision allow'd for Goods
consign'd to you , it is done by keeping an <font> Accompt <$$font> of
<font> Commissions <$$font> , which is Creditor by all the Provisions
charged on your Correspondent , either for Sale , or buying his Goods ,
and Debtor to <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss <$$font> , being so
much nett Gain added to your Stock . DRUMMOND-1718-1,13.147

The same Way you can know what each Correspondent makes yearly by your
Consignations . DRUMMOND-1718-1,13.148

Merchants frequently give a valuable Consideration one to another , to
run the Risque of Ship or Cargo they are concerned in ,
DRUMMOND-1718-1,13.149

and is named <font> Insurance <$$font> , which diminishing the Profit on
a Voyage , when you insure , may be added as a Charge upon the Adventure
, therefore comes more properly into the Scheme of the Voyage , a Book
for which you are to keep ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,13.150

the Method shall be described , with the manner of transporting it to
the journal . DRUMMOND-1718-1,13.151

When you risque another Man's Adventure , and receive a Consideration in
hand , which Merchants name <font> Praemio <$$font> , you are to keep an
Accompt of <font> Insurance <$$font> , which is <font> Debtor <$$font>
to <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss <$$font> , and <font> Creditor
<$$font> by <font> Cash <$$font> in the case of the Ship's Arrival .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,13.152

<P_14>

If the Ship is cast away , you have usually a Rebate for Payment of the
Money , Value of which was insured on her . DRUMMOND-1718-1,14.154

For what Money you pay , <font> Insurance <$$font> is <font> Creditor
<$$font> by <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss <$$font> for the
Difference betwixt the <font> Praemio <$$font> and the present Payment ;
which being added to the Money it had Credit for before , upon Payment
of the <font> Praemio <$$font> received , it is <font> Debtor <$$font>
to <font> Cash <$$font> for the Money presently paid out , and ballances
the opposite , and you see this Accompt closed . DRUMMOND-1718-1,14.155

To avoid Multiplicity of Accompts , you can bring as many as your Paper
can contain under one Title , giving them different Columns in the Leger
, where every one balances distinctly , as if they were separate
Accompts . DRUMMOND-1718-1,14.156

The different Commodities your Country affords , under the general Title
of <font> Domestick Trade . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,14.157

And such Men as I give not an Accompt to , I collect under the Title of
<font> Domestick Correspondents . <$$font> And for Forreigners , <font>
Correspondents <$$font> in such a Kingdom . DRUMMOND-1718-1,14.158

<font> Accompts in Partnership <$$font> Are , When a Society of <font>
Merchants <$$font> enter in <font> Trade <$$font> , and resolve all the
<font> Members <$$font> shall be jointly concerned in every Transaction
. DRUMMOND-1718-1,14.159

The Accompts are to be kept with no other Difference from <font> Proper
Accompts <$$font> , save the Title at commencing their Partnership .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,14.160

At breaking up or clearing , after having found the nett <font> Gain
<$$font> or <font> Loss <$$font> during their Trade ; each Partners
Proportion must be brought into his <font> Particular Accompt .
<$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,14.161

If the Society gain , <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss <$$font> is
<font> Debtor <$$font> , to ; if they lose , <font> Creditor <$$font> by
every Partner for their Share . DRUMMOND-1718-1,14.162

<P_15>

Such Societies entertain an Accomptant , DRUMMOND-1718-1,15.164

or one of the Partners keeps the Company Acccompts , with no other
difference from <font> Proper Accompts <$$font> , except making every
Partner Debtor or Creditor , upon Receipts or Payments , as other
Correspondents . DRUMMOND-1718-1,15.165

When you keep your own private Trade , and take in a Partner or two in
any <font> Adventure <$$font> , make <font> Cash , Bills <$$font> , or
any other <font> Effects <$$font> given by him for his Share or
Proportion , <font> Debtor <$$font> to such <font> Man <$$font> his
<font> Particular Accompt <$$font> , DRUMMOND-1718-1,15.166

and if he does not advance his Share make him <font> Debtor <$$font> to
the Goods hazarded on such Adventure . DRUMMOND-1718-1,15.167

At the End of the Voyage when you find the nett Gain , give each Partner
Credit for his Part of such Gain ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,15.168

if there is Loss on the Adventure , he must be debited with his Part of
the Loss . DRUMMOND-1718-1,15.169

In the first Case , <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss <$$font> is
<font> Debtor <$$font> , to his <font> Particular Accompt . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,15.170

In the last , That <font> Accompt <$$font> is <font> Debtor <$$font> to
<font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,15.171

To save a great many Posts in the Journal , and to make the Accompts of
the Voyages you have Interest in , show the Gain or Loss at one View ;
we keep a Book under the Title of <font> Scheme of Voyages , <$$font>
Which opens as the <font> Ware-House-Book . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,15.172

On the one side , insert the <font> Invoice <$$font> of the outward
Cargo and Charges added , on the opposite side the Accompt of Sales , as
advised by your Factor , with the Charges deducted . On the first again
, the <font> Invoice <$$font> of <font> Returns <$$font> ship'd by him
with Charges added ; opposite to it , the Sales of these Goods , as you
collect them from the <font> Ware-House-Book . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,15.173

By this Scheme you see the nett <font> Gain <$$font> or <font> Loss
<$$font> upon the <font> outward <$$font> and <font> inward <$$font>
Cargos in <font> Trading Voyages . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,15.174

<P_16>

Under all , if you trade with Partners , proportion the different Shares
of <font> Gain <$$font> or <font> Loss <$$font> , to be carried to the
<font> Particular Accompt <$$font> of each Person concerned with you .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,16.176

<font> A Factor Book <$$font> Differs little from the first Part of the
<font> Scheme-Book <$$font> ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,16.177

for on the first side you insert the <font> Parcels <$$font> of <font>
Goods <$$font> sent you , with the <font> Marks <$$font> and <font>
Numbers : <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,16.178

It may happen your Friend sends the Prices to guide you in the Sales .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,16.179

In this Case notice them regularly . DRUMMOND-1718-1,16.180

On the opposite side , keep an Accompt of the Sales , deducting
{TEXT:deducing} the Charges you pay on Accompt of these Goods , together
with the Commission or Provision allowed for your Trouble .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,16.181

I wou'd keep all consign'd Goods in this Book , untill the whole Sale is
out , or that my Correspondent calls , for his Accompt . At which Time
I see by the <font> Ware-House-Book <$$font> what are sold , and what on
hand . DRUMMOND-1718-1,16.182

Merchants as well as Masters ought to keep in a <font> Ship's Book
<$$font> the Outrick , and Reparations to be carried in to the Scheme of
the Voyage . DRUMMOND-1718-1,16.183

<font> Example <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,16.184

{COM:table_omitted}

<P_17>

In the preceeding <font> Scheme <$$font> and <font> Journal Post
<$$font> , you have 1st {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} The <font>
Invoice of <$$font> the outward Cargo . 2d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Sales Abroad . 3d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Gain on the Outward . 4th
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Returns ship'd by your Factor .
<font> 5th <$$font> , Sales of the Goods as you collected them from the
<font> Ware-House-Book . <font> 6th <$$font> , The Gain on the inward
Adventure . DRUMMOND-1718-1,17.187

<font> 7th <$$font> , By adding the inward and outward , the Sum is the
Total or nett Gain . DRUMMOND-1718-1,17.188

8th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , You are to proportion that in
three , the Number of , and the Gain of your Partners .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,17.189

You see <font> Forreign Adventures <$$font> Debtor for the outward Cargo
. <font> Domestick Trade <$$font> Creditor by the Value of the Goods .
A. W. my Factor in <font> Dantzig <$$font> , Debtor for the Sum as
they are sold . <font> Foreign Adventures <$$font> Creditor by the
Value , as it was before debited . <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss
<$$font> Creditor by the Profits on the outward . <font> Again when A.
W. ships the Returns . Foreign Adventures <$$font> Debtor for Cost and
Charges . A. W. - - Creditor by the same Sum . <font> When the Goods
are sold . Cash <$$font> Debtor , if paid for . <font> Persons
<$$font> Debtor , if sold on Time . <font> Goods <$$font> Debtor for
what remain on Hand . <font> Foreign Adventures <$$font> Creditor , by
the Value in my Factor's <font> Invoice . Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss
<$$font> Creditor by the Profit , and Debtor for the Loss . After you
have proportioned your Gain , <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss
<$$font> Debtor to And each of your Partners {TEXT:Partner} Creditor by
their Share . DRUMMOND-1718-1,17.190

<P_18>

If thus you ballance each Adventure in Partnership , there is no
Occasion to keep any other Accompt with your <font> Partner <$$font> ,
save his <font> particular Accompt . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,18.192

When you trade Coast ways ; in Place of the Title <font> Foreign
<$$font> Use <font> Coasting Adventures <$$font> Northward or Southward
. DRUMMOND-1718-1,18.193

If any of the Society borrow from , or lend to the capital , consider
them as private Men , to avoid keeping Accompts with them under
different Titles , which may give Trouble and create Confusion .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,18.194

Merchants ought not to neglect keeping a Book for <font> Port <$$font>
of <font> Letters <$$font> , because that is an Article charged to their
Correspondent's Accompt . DRUMMOND-1718-1,18.195

It may be kept , 1st {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , With a Column
for the Correspondent's Name . 2d {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} ,
The Place of his Residence , or from whence he writes . 3d
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The date of the Letter . 4th
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Day received , and it will not
be amiss . <font> 5th <$$font> , The Day answered , which will be an
Ease in any Case of Recourse to the <font> Letter-Book . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,18.196

You need keep no Money Column , because Postage being always rated ; you
are only to value the Number of Letters : DRUMMOND-1718-1,18.197

But if your Correspondent writes from different Places , keep a Money
Column . DRUMMOND-1718-1,18.198

You see a small Column in the Journal for the <font> Folio <$$font> ,
where the Accompt which you make <font> Debtor <$$font> or <font>
Creditor <$$font> is found in the Leger ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,18.199

therefore prepare a small Book , into which you carry all the Titles in
the Leger , according to the initial Letters , by the <font> Alphabet
<$$font> , adding the Number of the <font> Folio <$$font> , where the
Accompt is ; which Numbers , before you begin to transport , are to be
placed in the Journal . DRUMMOND-1718-1,18.200

Having titled the <font> Leger <$$font> or <font> Great Book of Accompts
<$$font> , make inner Columns for the Quantity , Quality and Numbers of
your Goods , and the Names of the Correspondents you keep under a
general Title . DRUMMOND-1718-1,18.201

Proceed to transport . DRUMMOND-1718-1,18.202

In this Work <P_19> there is no Difficulty if you observe ; when an
Accompt is <font> Debtor <$$font> , to see what Title is <font> Creditor
<$$font> , and write on the <font> Debit side , To such an Accompt
<$$font> , and hint at the Reason of the Debt in few Words ; then notice
the <font> Folio <$$font> where the <font> Creditor <$$font> is found ,
and carry out the Sum . DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.203

<font> Example <$$font> from the preceeding <font> Journal Post .
<$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.204

In <font> Folio 5th <$$font> , is the Title <font> Foreign Adventures
<$$font> , which is Debitor , <font> L. <$$font> 1159 : 6 : 7 : 8 ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.205

and in regard <font> Domestick Trade <$$font> is Creditor , you write on
the <font> Debit side <$$font> of F. A. to <font> Domestick Trade
<$$font> , which is in <font> Folio 6th <$$font> ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.206

turn to the <font> Credit side <$$font> of it , DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.207

and write , <font> By Foreign Adventures <$$font> , carrying the
Quantity of <font> Salmon , Herrings <$$font> and <font> Beef <$$font>
into their proper Columns . DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.208

<font> Then Correspondents in <$$font> Poland , DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.209

A. W. <font> is Debtor . <$$font> To <font> Foreign Adventures l.
<$$font> 1159 : 6 : 7 : 8 To <font> Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss - 523
: 9 : 5 : 4 <$$font> P. F. 25242_3$$4 <font> l. <$$font> 1682 : 16 :
1 DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.210

And on the Credit side of each of these Accompts they are <font>
Creditor <$$font> by <font> Correspondents <$$font> in <font> Poland
<$$font> for their respective Sums , and so with all the other Parts of
that Post , and any other that occurs to you . DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.211

Before you ballance your Leger , carry the Incidents from the Book ,
where they are kept into the Journal , that you may debit every Parcel
of Goods , except what you have already given <font> Cash <$$font>
Credit for , in the Schemes of Voyages . DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.212

Ballance the <font> Ware-House-Book <$$font> , that you may carry what
Goods are on hand into the <font> Accompt of Ballance <$$font> , at the
Value they cost . DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.213

See that you have rightly charged the Outrick of your Ships , in the
proper Schemes . DRUMMOND-1718-1,19.214

When you transport into your Leger , make a Prick or Mark at every Title
of an Accompt you carry from the Journal , <P_20> which you must
carefully examine , that each <font> Debtor <$$font> and <font> Creditor
<$$font> have its just opposite . DRUMMOND-1718-1,20.215

Compare the <font> Journal <$$font> with the <font> Leger <$$font> ,
that every Article and Sum is rightly carried in .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,20.216

Now to ballance , or close all the Accompts in the Leger , Sum up the
Debtor and Creditor side , and where you find a Difference , the least
side must have the Addition of a Sum to make them equal .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,20.217

But to know what Title , whether Gain and Loss , or Ballance , you are
to give that Sum which makes both sides equal ; observe the following
Instructions , noticing , when the Difference is expressed by the Word
<font> To <$$font> , it falls on the <font> Debit side <$$font> , if by
the Word <font> By <$$font> , it is on the <font> Credit side .
<$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,20.218

<font> Cash <$$font> closes <font> To <$$font> or <font> By Ballance .
Houses - To <$$font> or <font> By Ballance . Estate - - By Ballance .
Mens Accompts - To <$$font> or <font> By Ballance . Goods - To <$$font>
or <font> By Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss <$$font> , if sold . <font>
Ditto - - By Ballance <$$font> , for what are on hand . <font> Ships -
- By Ballance <$$font> , if not sold . <font> Foreign Adventures - To
<$$font> or <font> By Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss . Interest - To
<$$font> or <font> By Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss . Gain <$$font> and
<font> Loss - To <$$font> or <font> By Stock . Proper Charges - - By
Gain <$$font> and <font> Loss . Bodomry - To <$$font> or <font> By Gain
<$$font> and <font> Loss . DRUMMOND-1718-1,20.219

Household Furniture <$$font> Closes <font> By Ballance . House Rent
<$$font> - - <font> To <$$font> these to whom I owe , <font> By <$$font>
these who owe me . <font> Outstanding Debts <$$font> - <font> By
Ballance <$$font> . DRUMMOND-1718-1,20.220

<P_21>

Stock is the last Accompt to be ballanced , DRUMMOND-1718-1,21.222

and closes <font> To <$$font> , or <font> By Gain <$$font> and <font>
Loss <$$font> , as you are better or worse by your Trade , which you see
by the Ballance of the Accompt under that Title .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,21.223

And on the Debit side , To ballance for your present real Estate .
Having made up the <font> Accompt <$$font> of <font> Ballance <$$font>
from the closing of the other Accompts , the <font> Debit side <$$font>
of it is the <font> Inventary {COM:sic} <$$font> of the <font> Stock
<$$font> upon which we begin to trade ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,21.224

and the <font> Credit side <$$font> is the <font> List <$$font> of what
Debts you owe , which you carry in to your new Books for an <font>
Inventary {COM:sic} <$$font> , according to the preceeding Directions ,
and then go on to the Transactions in your Trade .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,21.225

I thought proper to subjoin a short <font> Essay on Fishing <$$font> ,
to encourage all our Country-men in the Application and Improvement of
the most beneficial <font> Branch <$$font> of our <font> Product .
<$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,21.226

<font> The Method of curing <$$font> Cod <font> and <$$font> Ling-Fish ,
Dry <font> and <$$font> Mud , White Herrings <font> and <$$font>
Seath-Fish ; <font> and some short Directions about boyling <$$font> Oyl
. DRUMMOND-1718-1,25.237

<$$heading>

We clearly see that the Almighty did not separate the World into Islands
and Continent by interveening Seas , purposing , that one Part of
Mankind should remain ignorant of the Condition of the rest of his
fellow Creatures , by Reason of that watry Barracade ; seeing the Great
God deign'd himself to be the first Sea Architect of that stupendous
Fabrick the Ark . DRUMMOND-1718-1,25.239

The Divine Providence so ordered the Product of different Countries ,
under their several Climates , that each Nation should want what
Commodities their Neighbours super-abounded in . DRUMMOND-1718-1,25.240

Besides all our other Produce and Manufactures , these Kingdoms have so
particular a Blessing bestowed upon them , by having their Seas stored
with the best Fish in the World . DRUMMOND-1718-1,25.241

It surprizes to find so few who adapt themselves to the Cure of <font>
white-Fish <$$font> which is a Branch of Trade of the most universal
Demand , <P_26> by all Countries on this side the Line .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,26.242

Our Legislators , for encouraging their Merchants to enrich their Nation
by such a valuable Trade , have given the Bounty of a <font> Draw-back
<$$font> on Fish exported , very much exceeding the Duties on foreign
Salt imported . DRUMMOND-1718-1,26.243

Our Neighbours in <font> Holland <$$font> have rendred themselves a rich
and flourishing People , by improving this inestimable Treasure , so
wonderfully in a manner thrown into our Laps , which exposes our Neglect
and Sloth to all trading Nations . DRUMMOND-1718-1,26.244

In regard , many who would be very much inclined to risque Part of their
Stock on so good a Design , may be ignorant of the Easiness and great
Value of this Trade . I shall endeavour at giving Directions to proceed
in the Cure of <font> white dry Fish <$$font> ; then give some
Instructions about <font> mud <$$font> or <font> wet Fish . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,26.245

In this , I shall follow the Method Used for serving the nicest Market ,
<font> i.e. Hamburgh , Bremen , <$$font> and all <font> Germany .
<$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,26.246

And <font> first <$$font> , The Undertaker must make the necessary
Preparations of <font> Tackle . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,26.247

You are to consider what Part of the Coast you design to fish upon , and
prepare your Boats accordingly . DRUMMOND-1718-1,26.248

If your Country lies not in a strong Tide-way , your Boats may be strong
built , consequently heavy , <P_27> and require the greater Number of
Men in them , when the Weather is calm . DRUMMOND-1718-1,27.249

If where you fish be in rapid and current Tides , your Boats ought to be
light and clever for Rowing : DRUMMOND-1718-1,27.250

And in such Seas you have always the best Fish . DRUMMOND-1718-1,27.251

For your <font> Lines <$$font> , you are to consider , 1st
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Depth of the Water where you
Fish , and it is to be observed , that the best and strongest Fish
delight to swim on these Banks where the Water is deepest . 2dly
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , The Number of Fish <paren> always
reckoning for the heaviest Size <$$paren> your Boat is capable to carry
a shore , allowing fewer for the greater Distance you set your Lines off
Land . DRUMMOND-1718-1,27.252

To one End of your Line make fast a Weight of <font> Lead <$$font> , or
what else you please capable to sink the Line to the Bottom .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,27.253

About three Fathom from the End , splice in a <font> Snout or Snude
<$$font> of a smaller Line <paren> which the Fisher-men commonly make of
Twine spun by themselves <$$paren> of 3 or 4 Foot long , as the Tides
are ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,27.254

if little Tide , the shorter Snout , to which your Hooks are made fast .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,27.255

Having , as before considered , the Number of Fish your Boat can carry ,
fix so many <font> Snouts <$$font> at a Fathom Distance , at least each
from other , upon your great Line or <font> Log <$$font> , which takes
its Name from an Earth-worm so called , as you find convenient .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,27.256

You are then to allow so much waste Line as the Water is deep , rather
some Fathoms more as less ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,27.257

to this you are to fix your <font> Buoys <$$font> :
DRUMMOND-1718-1,27.258

These may either be two strong Ox Bladders , or a tanned Sheep's Skin
blown up . DRUMMOND-1718-1,27.259

<P_28>

When you set your Lines , take <font> Meiths <$$font> or <font> Marks
<$$font> upon the Land , whereby you can find them in the Morning ,
DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.261

for you always set in the Evening . DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.262

If you can get Foreign <font> Hooks <$$font> , they are much preferable
to our own , altho that Manufacture might be much improved if Fishing
was encouraged . DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.263

You must also provide <font> Hair-cloth <$$font> , which is wrought half
Yard wide , DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.264

we commonly have them from <font> Hamburg . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.265

Let the Place where your <font> Boats <$$font> land be where you have a
<font> Beach <$$font> above high Water Mark , covered with pretty large
round Stones if possible : DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.266

If you have none naturally , you must of necessity make such an one by
carrying and laying Stones , DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.267

otherwise your Fish can@ @not dry , nor the Slime and Blood run from
them . DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.268

You are to have a <font> Table <$$font> to split your Fish on ,
DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.269

this may be 7 Foot long and 3 Foot broad , of a convenient Height ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.270

this you carry down close {TEXT:closs} to the Sea when you split and
clean your Fish . DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.271

You are to have a sufficient Number of <font> Hand-Barrows . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.272

{COM:picture_omitted}

Your splitting <font> Knife <$$font> ought to be at least 6 Inches in
the Blade , and the Handle capable to receive the full Grasp of a large
Hand of this Shape . DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.274

You ought to build a <font> Store-House <$$font> closs to the Beach ,
big enough to suit your Trade . DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.275

Lastly , you are to make <font> Fish-Fats <$$font> , in Number conform
to the Quantity of Fish your Boats can catch ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,28.276

they are made of Oak Plank , 1_1$$2 Inch thick , deep , a <P_29> good
Reach , broad 4 Foot , and at least 6 or 7 Foot long .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.277

The Seams are to be nicely caulkt and well pitcht by a Carpenter , and
tarred every Spring . DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.278

In the Bottom you have two Holes to let out the Pickle .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.279

Having made these necessary Provisions , you are to keep in your
Storehouse every little thing the poor Fisher-men have Occasion for .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.280

<heading>

<font> Cure . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.282

<$$heading>

If your Business can afford it , you ought to entertain a Splitter ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.284

he can instruct others whom you may settle at the different Places where
your Boats land . DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.285

The Benefit of this is great , because a Fish when nicely split , shows
to vast Advantage in a Foreign Market . DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.286

A curious Splitter begins under the Tongue , DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.287

and cuts down to the Navel , DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.288

he throws away the Bone so far , DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.289

the rest remains with the Fish ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.290

he leaves a little of the small Part of the Bone , which we call the
<font> Feather . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.291

You ought to suppress a Custom the Fishers have , of splitting at Sea ,
unless each Boat has a Man who can do it well , because thereby you lose
the Tongues and Soams , which are delicate when salted .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.292

Clean the Head and Lug , which is the Extremity of the thin Part of the
Belly , DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.293

and let no Blood remain on the Fish ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.294

wash them well in the Sea , DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.295

and throw them on a Heap to drain the Glit from them .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.296

Cover the Bottom of the Fish-Fat with Salt , DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.297

lay the Backs of the first Fish down , DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.298

cover the Bellies with Salt ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,29.299

lay the next Fish Belly to Belly ; observing this Method untill the
<P_30> Chist or Fat is full , or the Fish all laid .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.300

Be sure to salt the Lug well , DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.301

for the Fish begins to spoil first in that Place .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.302

When the Salt begins to melt to Pickle , lay heavy Stones on the Fish ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.303

this squeezes the Glit from them , DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.304

and makes them clear when dry . DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.305

Let the Fish lie {TEXT:ly} untill the Salt is intirely run to Pickle ,
which may be in two Days , DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.306

take them out DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.307

and wash them well in the Sea , DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.308

lay them out on their Backs single upon the Beach .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.309

Every Night lay them in Pairs Belly to Belly ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.310

when they are half dry , upon the least Rain , clap them together in
Pairs , DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.311

or toss their Backs up . DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.312

When thus half dry , every Night make them up in <font> Horses ,
DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.313

i.e. <$$font> lay down the first Layer in a Circle , so wide as you
design your Horse , the Backs down ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.314

then heap on to make it narrow at Top ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.315

this you cover with the Hair-cloath in Rain . DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.316

Every Morning , with the Sun , lay out your Fish to dry ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.317

you can know when throughly dry , by taking the Fish by the Tail ,
DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.318

hold it up , DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.319

and if well cured , it is almost so stiff as to stand in your Hand .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.320

{COM:symbol_omitted}

N.B. The Fish are good , if clear . DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.322

When your Fish are dry , you may build them up in the Store-house , if
capable to receive them ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.323

if not , build them up in large Horses ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.324

and in Rain , cover them with Hair-cloth or Boats Sails .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.325

When you design to ship or send off your Fish , lay them out an Hour or
two upon the Beach , with a warm Sun ; this gives them a Clearness like
hoar Frost , which we call the <font> Bloom . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.326

If thus shipt , they will keep the Bloom , untill they are landed at any
foreign Mercat . DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.327

Your own Experience in curing one Fat of Fish , will be a better Rule
for the Quantity of Salt required , than any Person can give you .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,30.328

<P_31>

I shall give a Guess in the adjoined Scheme . DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.330

<font> Mud Fish <$$font> Are used directly as those you resolve to dry ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.331

give them one Day upon the Beach to drain the Blood and Glit from them .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.332

Then pack them in Barrels with dry Salt , as you do in the Fat .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.333

If you are to stow them in the Ship's Hold in Bing , then make
Partitions as Fats . DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.334

When you salt mud Fish at Sea , you rub them well all over with Salt ,
before you either barrel or bing them ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.335

but you must bestow double the Quantity of Salt .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.336

You may save the Pickle of your dry Fish , in which you lay these that
are under the Size of 18 Inches , because they can@ @not be exported ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.337

therefore salt them and Skate , with small Salt for an Inland Consumpt .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.338

<heading>

<font> Herrings , white . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.340

<$$heading>

I shall suppose your Fisher-men know how to lay and hale their Nets : A
sufficient Number of which you must provide for each Boat according to
her Bigness . DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.342

You set your Nets at Night , DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.343

and the Boat rides fast by the Rope of the Last you throw out ,
DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.344

so drives by her Nets . DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.345

The Reason of having more as one is , that you may easily make them up
as you hale them in , without intangling ; which could not well be done
with one large Net . DRUMMOND-1718-1,31.346

<P_32>

By the Dawn of Day you begin to hale the Nets as fast as you get
Herrings ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.348

some of the Men fall about gipping or gutting them ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.349

and as@ @soon as all the Nets are in , set all Hands to work .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.350

The <font> Dutch <$$font> throw all the Herrings away which are not
gipped against Mid-day , as being good for nothing but to spoil the rest
. DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.351

If your Boats land their Fish every Morning , you can rouze the Fish in
Fats . DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.352

<heading>

<font> Cure . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.354

<$$heading>

Lay Salt on the Bottom , then a Layer of Herrings , which sprinkle with
Salt ; then another Layer of Fish , and so on untill the Fat is full ,
or all the Herrings laid . DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.356

Let them rouze 16 , 18 or 20 Days , as your Time can permit ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.357

draw off DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.358

and save your Pickle , being incomparably better than any fresh made ,
DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.359

drain them two Days . DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.360

Your Barrels being ready , strow the Bottom with Salt :
DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.361

Your Packer ought to be dextrous in packing the Herrings closs together
, setting them upon the Ridge of their Back , and covering every Fish
well with Salt . DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.362

They must be well squeezed down , by heaping them above the Chime of the
Barrel ; DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.363

then the Cooper claps on the Head , DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.364

and jumps upon it , till it enter the Chime . DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.365

When headed , throw the Barrel down on the Buldge :
DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.366

Make a Hole in the Bung-stave for a Funnel to enter .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.367

If you judge your Pickle may run short , add a sufficient Quantity of
fresh Water , which strengthen with Salt , till capable to swim a
Herring . DRUMMOND-1718-1,32.368

<P_33>

Fill up your Barrels two or three Times with Pickle untill they can hold
no more , before you close them . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.370

Your Cooper must be very carefull about tighting the Barrels ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.371

if the Pickle leak out , your Herrings will gild ,
DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.372

and then they are fit for no Mercat . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.373

The <font> Dutch <$$font> dare not wet their Nets before 13. <font>
June <$$font> , DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.374

and Fish none to the Northward after 1. of <font> August . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.375

The 14. <font> August <$$font> they Fish on the Banks of <font>
Tarmouth <$$font> for Herrings , which they smoak for their own Winter
Consumpt . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.376

You will know a well cured Herring , DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.377

cut it to the Bone , DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.378

and if both Fish and Bone is white , the Fish is perfectly good .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.379

A Barrel well packed will hold 900 Herrings . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.380

<heading>

<font> Estimate of the Quantity of Salt . <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.382

<$$heading>

1 Bushel , or 84 <font> Lib. <$$font> Weight of Foreign Salt will cure
120 dried Cod . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.384

2 Bushels , or 168 <font> Lib. <$$font> Weight will cure 120 dried Ling
. DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.385

2 Bushels will cure 120 wet or mud Cod . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.386

4 Bushels will cure 120 mud Ling . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.387

14 Bushels will cure 12 Barrels white Herrings , and half that Quantity
for red . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.388

6 Barrels small Salt will cure 12 Barrels white Herrings . 3 Barrels to
so many red . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.389

These cured with small Salt are only for an Inland Market , because you
dare not export them . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.390

To encourage young Undertakers in beginning so beneficial a Trade ,
peruse the following Schemes . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.391

They are calculate for the Cure of 120 Fish . DRUMMOND-1718-1,33.392

<P_34>

Column 1st {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , Is the Price of the
Quantity of Salt at the highest Value here . DRUMMOND-1718-1,34.394

2d {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , Is the Custom and Excise of the
Salt . 3d {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , Value of the fresh Fish
at the highest . DRUMMOND-1718-1,34.395

4th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , Are the three first Columns
added to make a total Charge . DRUMMOND-1718-1,34.396

5th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , Is the Debenture or Bounty
given by the Crown to encourage Fishing . DRUMMOND-1718-1,34.397

6th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} , Is the nett Sum your Fish cost
after Deduction of the Debenture . DRUMMOND-1718-1,34.398

I have reckoned the Herrings at 10 Pence <font> per <$$font> Hundred ,
which will be a high Price , if you balance what they cost you during
the whole Season of catching them . DRUMMOND-1718-1,34.399

<P_35>

{COM:table_omitted}

<P_36>

{COM:table_omitted}

<P_37>

You see here the vast Advantage of a fishing Trade .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.405

The Debentures make the Price of Fish very small :
DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.406

Dry Cod of 24 Inches you have for 5 Pence Farthing the great Hundred .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.407

Upon mud Cod of same length , you have not only the great Hundred Fish
for nothing , but also , by the great Debenture , you have a Profit for
your Pains of 15 Shillings 9 Pence half Penny <font> Sterl. <$$font>
DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.408

This Consideration , I hope , will induce People to improve this so
great Blessing . DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.409

In this Essay I have taken no notice of any Fish except these which the
Law hath encouraged the Cure of , by granting a Debenture exceeding the
Duties on Salt . DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.410

You have here also the Shape of a <font> Cod-Fish <$$font> , by which
you can see how the Fish must be measured , and how far the Bone is to
be cut out . DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.411

The Back is supposed to be up : DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.412

Clap the End of the Gauge-Rod to the little upper Fin , marked <paren>
<font> a <$$font> <$$paren> ; the other End touching the third Bone in
the Tail in <paren> <font> b <$$font> <$$paren> .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.413

And now it will not be improper to speak something of <font> Seath Fish
. <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.414

This Fish , when young , is a great Support to the Islanders ;
DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.415

they catch them in great Numbers . DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.416

When old , they sell to very good Account for an Inland Market .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.417

You salt them with small Salt , just as you do dry Cod .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.418

The Livers of this Fish afford the best of any Fish-Oyl .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,37.419

It will not be amiss to say something of the Method of <P_38> <font>
Boyling Oyl . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.420

<font> Having such Kettles as your Business can afford . <$$font> All
the while your Livers are boyling , be carefull in skiming well , which
is the greatest Nicety , DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.421

for there is no other Art in it . DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.422

You will know when it is free from the Dreg , DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.423

no more Scum will rise . DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.424

Then draw it off with your Ladles , DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.425

and boil the Dregs again untill you can have no more clear Oyl .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.426

If you get any Seals or Whales , or Porpoices , or in short any other
oyly Fish , use the following Method . DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.427

Cut off the Speck , DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.428

then cut it in very small Peices , DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.429

put it in Fish Fats for some Time , untill it begin to melt .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.430

Afterwards take it out , DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.431

and boyling it well in your Kettles , skim off the Oyl .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.432

You are to boil this Speck untill there remain no Oyl in it .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.433

The Oyl you boil again as long as any Scum rises .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.434

Observing this , you can@ @not fail to have clear Oyl .
DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.435

Your Barrels must be very tight , and the Heads well limed ,
DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.436

for Oyl is amongst the most searching Liquids . DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.437

<font> Finis . <$$font> DRUMMOND-1718-1,38.438
