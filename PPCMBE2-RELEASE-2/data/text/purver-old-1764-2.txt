Chap. IV . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.4

<$$heading>

And Adam had the knowledge of Eve his Wife , so that she conceived , and
bearing Cain , said , I have gained the Lord with a Man . After which
she bore his Brother Abel ; who became the Shepherd of the Flock , as
Cain was the Tiller of the Ground . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.6

So at the End of the Year , Cain brought an Offering to the Lord of the
Crop of the Land . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.7

And Abel also bringing <font> one , <$$font> of the Firstlings of his
Flock , and of their Fat , the Lord had respect to him , and his
Offering ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.8

But to Cain and his he had none : at which Cain was very angry , and his
Countenance loured . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.9

Then the Lord said to him ; Why art thou angry ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.10

And why is thy Look cast down ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.11

If thou doest well , will it not be accepted ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.12

<paren> But if thou dost not , Sin lies at the Door ; <$$paren>
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.13

his Mind also will be to thee , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.14

for thou rulest over him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.15

Nevertheless Cain speaking to Abel his Brother ; when they were in the
Field , he rose up against his Brother Abel , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.16

and killed him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.17

Upon this the Lord asked Cain , Where is Abel thy Brother ? Who
answered , I know not ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.18

am I my Brother's Keeper ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.19

But he replied ; What hast thou done ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.20

The Voice of thy Brother's Blood cries to me from the Ground .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.21

Now therefore thou shalt be cursed , from the Ground , which opened its
Mouth , to receive the same from thy Hand . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.22

When thou tillest the Ground , it shall no more yield its Strength to
thee : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.23

a Wanderer and a Vagabond shalt thou be on the Earth .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.24

And Cain complained to the Lord ; The Punishment of my Iniquity is too
great to bear . Behold thou drivest me off to_Day from the Surface of
the Ground , that I may be hid from thy Face ; and when I am a Wanderer
and Vagabond on the Earth , whoever finds me will kill me . To whom the
Lord said , Therefore whoever kills Cain , it shall be revenged
sevenfold . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.25

Besides the Lord shewed a Sign to Cain , that none who found him should
slay him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.26

Now he going out from before the Lord , dwelt in the Country of Nod , on
the East of Eden . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.27

And Cain had the knowledge of his Wife , so that she conceived , and
bore Enoch ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.28

he also built a City , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.29

and called the Name of it Enoch , like that of his Son .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.30

To Enoch likewise was born Irad , who begot Mehujael , as he did
Methusael , and this Lamech . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.31

Next Lamech took him two Wives ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.32

the Name of one was Adah , and the other's Name Zillah .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1G.33

<P_4,20G>

And Adah bore Jabal ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20G.35

he was the first of such as dwelt with Tents and Cattle . Whose
Brother's Name was Jubal ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20G.36

he was the first of all who played upon the Harp and Organ .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20G.37

And Zillah too bore Tubal-cain , a Maker of all Edge-tools with Steel
and Iron ; his Sister being Naamah . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20G.38

And Lamech said to these his Wives ; Hear what I say , you Wives of
Lamech , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20G.39

give ear to my Expression ; because I have killed a Man to my own
Wounding , and a young Man to my Hurt : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20G.40

Since Cain shall have Vengeance taken sevenfold , so shall Lamech
seventy and sevenfold . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20G.41

Adam moreover had the knowledge of his Wife again , so that she brought
forth a Son , and called his Name Seth : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20G.42

for God has put me , <font> said she , <$$font> other Offspring instead
of Abel , because Cain slew him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20G.43

And to Seth himself also there was a Son born , whom he named Enos .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20G.44

Then it was begun to be called by the Name of the Lord .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20G.45

<P_5,1G>

Chap. V . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.48

<$$heading>

This is the Book of Adam's Generations . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.50

On the Day that God created Mankind , he made each of them in his own
Likeness ; Creating them Male and Female : whom he blessed ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.51

and called their Name Mankind the same Day they were created .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.52

And Adam living a_hundred_and_thirty Years , begot <font> him <$$font>
in his Likeness , after his Similitude , whose Name was called Seth .
After which his Time was eight_hundred Years , and he begot Sons and
Daughters . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.53

So all the Time which Adam had lived , was nine_hundred_and_thirty Years
, when he died . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.54

And Seth living a_hundred_and_five Years , begot Enos . After which he
lived eight_hundred_and_seven Years , and begot Sons and Daughters .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.55

So all the Time of Seth was nine_hundred_and_twelve Years , when he died
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.56

And Enos living ninety Years , begot Cainan . After which he lived
eight_hundred_and_fifteen Years , and begot Sons and Daughters .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.57

So all the Time of Enos was nine_hundred_and_five Years , when he died .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.58

And Cainan living seventy Years , begot Mahalaleel . After which he
lived eight_hundred_and_forty Years , and begot Sons and Daughters .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.59

So all the Time of Cainan was nine_hundred_and_ten Years , when he died
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.60

And Mahalaleel living sixty_five Years , begot Jared . After which he
lived eight_hundred_and_thirty Years , and begot Sons and Daughters .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.61

So all the Time of Mahalaleel was eight_hundred_ninety_five Years , when
he died . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.62

And Jared living a_hundred_sixty_two Years , begot Enoch . After which
he lived eight_hundred Years , and begot Sons and Daughters .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1G.63

<P_5,20G>

So all the Time of Jared was nine_hundred_sixty_two Years , when he died
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.65

And Enoch living sixty_five Years , begot Methuselah . After which he
walked continually with God three_hundred Years , and begot Sons and
Daughters . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.66

So all the Time of Enoch was three_hundred_sixty_five Years .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.67

Then he having walked so with God , was gone ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.68

for God took him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.69

And Methuselah living a_hundred_eighty_seven Years , begot Lamech .
After which he lived seven_hundred_eighty_two Years , and begot Sons and
Daughters . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.70

So all the Time of Methuselah was nine_hundred_sixty_nine Years , when
he died . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.71

And Lamech living a_hundred_eighty_two Years , begot a Son : Whose Name
he called Noah , saying . This will comfort us for our Work , and for
the Labour of our Hands , by the Ground which the Lord has cursed .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.72

And Lamech lived after he begot Noah five_hundred_ninety_five Years ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.73

and begot Sons and Daughters . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.74

So his whole Time was seven_hundred_seventy_seven Years , when he died .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.75

Lastly Noah being in his five_hundredth Year , begot Shem , Ham and
Japheth . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20G.76

<P_10,1G>

<heading>

Chap. X . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.79

<$$heading>

And the following were the Generations of Noah's Sons , Shem , Ham and
Japheth ; who had Children born after the Deluge .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.81

The Sons of Japheth were , Gomer , Magog , Madai , Javan , Tubal ,
Meshech and Tiras ; And Gomer's Sons , Ashchenaz , Riphath and Togarmah
; As also the Sons of Javan , Elishah and Tarshish , Chittim and Dodanim
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.82

By these were the Regions of the Gentiles parted , for their Countries
<font> to <$$font> each one after his Language ; according to their
Families , in their Nations . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.83

And the Sons of Ham were Cush , Mizraim , Phut and Canaan .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.84

The Sons likewise of Cush were , Seba , Havilah , Sabtah , Raamah and
Sabtecha Raamah's Sons being Sheba and Dedan .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.85

Moreover Cush begot Nimrod ; who began to be powerful on the Earth :
Which he was at Hunting before the Lord ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.86

therefore it is said , As Nimrod was powerful at Hunting before the Lord
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.87

And the Beginning of his Kingdom was Babylon , Erech , Accad and Calneh
, in the Country of Shinar . Out of which Country he went to Assyria ,
and built Nineveh , with the Streets of the City , and Calah ; As
likewise Resen between Nineveh and Calah , that was a great City .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.88

And Mizraim begot the Ludites , Anamites , Lehabites , Naphtuhites ,
Pathrusites , and Casluhites ; from whom came forth the Philistines ,
and the Caphtorites . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.89

Canaan also begot Zidon his First-born , and Heth , With the Jebusites ,
Amorites , Girgashites , Hivites , Arkites , Sinites , Arvadites ,
Zemarites , and Hamathites ; after which the Families of the Canaanites
were dispersed abroad . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.90

Now the Border of the Canaanites was from Zidon , going by Gerar , to
Gaza ; passing by Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah and Zeboim , to Lasha .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1G.91

<P_10,20G>

These were the Sons of Ham , according to their Families , after their
Languages ; by their Countries , in their Nations .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20G.93

And there were born also to Shem <paren> the Father of all the Hebrews ,
the Brother of Japheth the eldest <$$paren> His Sons , Elam , Ashur ,
Arphaxad , Lud and Aram . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20G.94

And Aram's Sons were , Uz , Hul , Gether and Mash .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20G.95

Besides Arphaxad begot Shelah , as he did Eber .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20G.96

And the latter had two Sons born ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20G.97

the Name of one was Peleg , because the Earth was divided in his Time ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20G.98

and his Brother's Name was Joktan . Who begot Almodad , Sheleph ,
Hazarmaveth , Jerah , Hadoram , Uzal , Diklah , Obal , Abimael , Sheba ,
Ophir , Havilah and Jobab : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20G.99

all these were the Sons of Joktan . Whose Habitation was from Mesha ,
going to Sephar , a Mountain in the East . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20G.100

The Sons of Shem were these , after their Families , after their
Languages ; by their Countries , according to their Nations .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20G.101

The foregoing were the Families of Noah's Sons , after their Generations
, in their Nations ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20G.102

and by these were the Nations parted on the Earth after the Flood .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20G.103

<P_11,1G>

<heading>

Chap. XI . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.106

<$$heading>

Now those of the whole Earth had one Language , and the same Words .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.108

And as they were going on from the East , they found a Vale in the
Country of Shinar , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.109

and dwelt there . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.110

Then they said one to another , Come , let us make Bricks , and burn
<font> them <$$font> well ; they having Brick instead of Stone , as they
had Mortar for Clay . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.111

And added they , Come , let us build us a City , and a Tower whose Top
shall be at Heaven , and make our selves famous ; that we may not be
dispersed all over the Earth . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.112

But the Lord descended to see the City and the Tower , which the Sons of
Men were building . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.113

For he said ; Behold the People are one , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.114

and all of them have one Speech ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.115

and as they have begun to do this , now there will Nothing which they
have contrived to do be kept back from them .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.116

Come , let us go down , and confound their Language there ; that they
may not understand one another's Speech . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.117

Thus the Lord dispersed them from thence all over the Earth ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.118

and they left off building the City . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.119

Therefore it was named Babylon , because there the Lord confounded the
Language of those of the whole Earth ; that he might disperse them from
thence all over it . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.120

These were Shem's Generations : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.121

Shem when he was in his hundredth Year begot Arphaxad , two Years after
the Flood . After which he lived five_hundred Years , and begot Sons
and Daughters . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.122

And when Arphaxad had lived thirty_five Years , he begot Shelah . After
which he lived four_hundred_and_three Years , and begot Sons and
Daughters . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.123

And when Shelah had lived thirty Years , he begot Eber . After which he
lived four_hundred_and_three Years , and begot Sons and Daughters .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.124

And when Eber had lived thirty_four Years , he begot Peleg . After
which he lived four_hundred_and_thirty Years , and begot Sons and
Daughters . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.125

And when Peleg had lived thirty Years , he begot Reu . After which he
lived two_hundred_and_nine Years , and begot Sons and Daughters .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1G.126

<P_11,20G>

And when Reu had lived thirty_two Years , he begot Serug . After which
he lived two_hundred_and_seven Years , and begot Sons and Daughters .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.128

And when Serug had lived thirty Years , he begot Nahor . After which he
lived two_hundred Years , and begot Sons and Daughters .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.129

And when Nahor had lived twenty_nine Years , he begot Terah . After
which he lived a_hundred_and_nineteen Years , and begot Sons and
Daughters . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.130

And when Terah had lived seventy Years , he begot Abram , Nahor and
Haran . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.131

So the Generations of Terah were these : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.132

he begot the three now mentioned ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.133

and Haran begot Lot . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.134

At length Haran died in the Presence of his Father Terah , in his native
Country , at Ur of the Chaldeans . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.135

Abram and Nahor also took them Wives : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.136

the Name of Abram's Wife was Sarai , and that of Nahor's Milcah , the
Daughter of Haran ; <font> he <$$font> being the Father both of her and
Iscah . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.137

But Sarai was barren , having no Child . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.138

Afterwards Terah took Abram his Son , with Lot the Son of Haran his
Grandson , and his Daughter-in-law Sarai his Son Abram@ @'s Wife : who
went out of Ur of the Chaldeans with them , to go to the Country of
Canaan ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.139

and coming to Haran , they abode there . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.140

And the Time of Terah being two_hundred_and_five Years , he died at
Haran . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20G.141

<P_15,1G>

<heading>

Chap. XV . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.144

<$$heading>

After these Things Abram had this Word of the Lord in a Vision , Do not
fear , Abram ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.146

I will be a Shield to thee , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.147

thy Reward shall be very great . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.148

And he said , O Sovereign Lord , what wilt thou give me , since I go
childless , and the Son left of my Family is Eliezer of Damascus ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.149

Lo , continued he , thou having given me no Offspring ; behold he is the
Heir to me . When behold it was answered him by the Word of the Lord ,
This shall not be thy Heir , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.150

but one who will proceed forth from thy self shall .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.151

Nay he had him out abroad , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.152

and said , Look now towards Heaven , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.153

and tell the Stars , if thou canst do it ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.154

thus , added he to him , shall thy Offspring be .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.155

And he believed the Lord , who reckoned it Righteousness to him .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.156

Moreover he said to him , I am the Lord , who brought thee out of Ur of
the Chaldeans , to give thee this Country to inherit . Upon whose
asking , Sovereign Lord , by what shall I know , that I shall inherit it
? He answers him , Fetch me a Heifer , a She-goat and a Ram , each of
the third Year , with a Turtle-dove , and a young Pigeon .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.157

So he fetched him all these , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.158

and cut them apart in the middle , putting the Pieces one against the
other ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.159

but did not cut apart the Birds . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.160

And the Fowls coming down upon the carcasses , Abram drove them away .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.161

And at Sunset a deep Sleep fell upon him , as behold there did also a
Terror of great Darkness . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.162

Then he said to him ; Know fully that thy Offspring shall be Sojourners
in a Country which is not theirs , and shall serve those of it , who
will afflict them , four_hundred Years . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.163

But I will also judge the Nation which they are to serve ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.164

and after that they shall come out with great Substance .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.165

And when thou art gone to thy Fathers in Peace , being buried in a good
old Age ; At the fourth Generation they shall return hither :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.166

for the Iniquity of the Amorites is not yet finished .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.167

When the Sun likewise was gone down , and it was Twilight , lo there was
a smoaking Oven , and a Lamp of Fire , which passed between those Parts
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.168

That Day the Lord made the following Covenant with Abram ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1G.169

I give this Country to thy Offspring , from the River of Egypt , to the
great one , the River Euphrates ; Namely of the Kenites , and the
Kenizzites , and the Kadmonites , <P_15,20G> And the Hittites , and the
Perizzites , and the Giants , And the Amorites , and the Canaanites ,
and the Girgashites , and the Jebusites . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20G.170

<P_16,1G>

Chap. XVI . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.173

<$$heading>

Now Sarai the Wife of Abram did not bear to him ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.175

and having an Egyptian Servant-maid , whose Name was Hagar , She says to
him , Behold now the Lord having shut me up from bearing , do go in to
my Maid , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.176

perhaps I may be built up by her ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.177

and Abram hearkened to what she said . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.178

So Sarai his Wife took and gave her in Marriage to him , when he had
dwelt to the End of ten Years in the Country of Canaan .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.179

And he went in to Hagar , who conceived ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.180

and when she found that she was with child , her Mistress was
contemptible in her Sight . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.181

At this Sarai says to Abram , My Wrong is upon Thee ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.182

I have given my Maid into thy Bosom , who perceives that she is with
child , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.183

and I am contemptible in her Sight : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.184

the Lord judge betwixt me and thee . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.185

And he answered her , Lo thy Maid is in thy Power ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.186

do to her what thou likest . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.187

Upon this Sarai so afflicted her , that she fled from her Presence .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.188

But the Angel of the Lord found her at a Fountain of Water in the
Wilderness , that is in the Way to Shur . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.189

And he said , Hagar , Sarai's Handmaid , from whence dost thou come ?
And whither art thou going ? Who answered , I am fleeing from the
Presence of my Mistress Sarai . To whom the same replies , Go back to
thy Mistress , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.190

and humble thy self under her Authority . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.191

He also said to her , I will multiply thy Offspring abundantly ;
insomuch that it shall not be counted up for Multitude .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.192

Behold thou being with child , continued he to her , shalt bear a Son ;
whom thou Shalt name Ishmael , because the Lord has hearkened to thy
Affliction . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.193

However he will be <font> like <$$font> a wild Ass to Men , his Hand
being against every one , and every one's Hand against him ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.194

yet he shall dwell before all his Brethren .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.195

And she called the Name of the Lord who spoke to her , Thou God of Sight
: PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.196

for she said , Do I also see here after the Sight ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.197

Therefore the Well was called , The Well Lahai-roi :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.198

lo it is between Kadesh and Bered . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.199

At length Hagar bore Abram a Son ; who named his Son , that she did bear
, Ishmael . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.200

And he was in his eighty_sixth Year , when she bore Ishmael to him ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,16,1G.201

<P_17,1G>

Chap. XVII . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.204

<$$heading>

Afterwards when he was in his ninety_ninth Year , the Lord appeared to
Abram , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.206

and says to him ; I am God Almighty , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.207

walk continually before me , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.208

and be perfect . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.209

So will I cause my Covenant to be between me and thee , that I will
multiply thee exceeding much . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.210

With that he falling upon his Face , God spoke to him as follows ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.211

It is I , whose Covenant behold is with thee , that thou shalt be the
Father of many Nations . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.212

Therefore thy Name shall not hence forth be called Abram ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.213

but it shall be Abraham ; because I make thee the Father of many Nations
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.214

For I will cause thee to be fruitful exceeding much , that I may make
thee Nations ; and Kings shall proceed forth from thee .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.215

Besides I will confirm my Covenant betwixt me and thee , with thy
Offspring after thee in their Generations , for a lasting Covenant ; to
be a God to thee , and to them hereafter . To both of whom I will give
the Country of thy Sojournings , all that of Canaan , for a lasting
Possession ; as well as be a God to them . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.216

Thou shalt then keep my Covenant , said God also to him , and thy future
Posterity throughout their Generations : Which is this between me and
you , with them , that you shall observe ; every Male of you shall be
circumcised . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.217

For you shall cut off the Flesh of your Foreskins , that it may be a
Sign of the Covenant between me and you . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.218

And all your Males shall be circumcised on their eighth Day , throughout
your Generations ; home-born , and bought with Money of any Stranger ,
who is not of thy Offspring . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.219

He who is born of thy Family , and he who is bought with thy Money shall
be throughly circumcised ; that my Covenant may be a lasting one in your
Flesh . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.220

As for the uncircumcised Male , the Flesh of whose Foreskin is not
circumcised , that Person shall be cut off from his People , having
broken my Covenant . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.221

God said further to him ; Thou shalt not call the Name of Sarai thy Wife
so ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.222

for it shall be Sarah . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.223

And I will bless her , and also give thee a Son by her ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.224

nay I will so bless her , that she shall become Nations ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.225

there shall be Kings of People from her . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.226

Again Abraham fell on his Face , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.227

and smiled , saying in his Heart , Shall he who is in his hundredth Year
have <font> one <$$font> born ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.228

And shall Sarah bear in her ninetieth Year ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.229

And he said to God , Oh that Ishmael may live before thee ! To which
God replied ; Verily thy Wife Sarah shall bear thee a Son , whom thou
shalt name Isaac PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.230

and I will confirm my Covenant with him , to be a lasting one to his
Offspring after him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,1G.231

<P_17,20G>

I have hearkened to thee also for Ishmael ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.233

behold I bless him , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.234

will make him fruitful , and increase him exceeding much :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.235

he shall beget twelve Princes , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.236

and I will cause him to be a great Nation .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.237

But I will confirm my Covenant with Isaac ; whom Sarah shall bear to
thee at this appointed Time , in the next Year .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.238

So making an end of conversing with him , God ascended from Abraham .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.239

Then he took his Son Ishmael , with all who were born of his Family ,
and every one who was bought with his Money , each Male of his
Domesticks , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.240

and cut off the Flesh of their Foreskins that same Day , according as
God ordered him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.241

And Abraham was in his ninety_ninth Year , when he was circumcised in
his Foreskin . As was his Son Ishmael in his thirteenth Year , when his
Foreskin was cut off . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.242

On that very Day were they both circumcised .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.243

All the Men likewise of his Family , home-born , and bought with Money
of Strangers , were circumcised with him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,17,20G.244

<P_18,1G>

Chap. XVIII . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.247

<$$heading>

Moreover the Lord appeared to him among the Oaks of Mamre , as he was
sitting at the Door of the Tent , in the Heat of the Day . Where
looking up , he saw apparently that three Men were standing before him ;
whom when he saw , he ran to meet from the Tent-door , and bowed down to
the Ground . And said ; Lord , if now I am in favour with thee , go not
away , I beseech thee , from thy Servant . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.249

Let a little Water ; I pray , be fetched , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.250

and wash your Feet , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.251

and lean down under a Tree . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.252

Besides that let me fetch a Bit of Bread , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.253

and do you support your Hearts , after which you may go on ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.254

for therefore have you come before your Servant .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.255

And they said , Do according as thou hast spoken .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.256

Abraham accordingly hastened into the Tent to Sarah ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.257

and said , Knead quickly three Seahs of fine Flour ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.258

and make Cakes . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.259

He likewise ran to the Herd , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.260

and taking a tender and good Calf , gave to a young Man , that he might
make haste to get it ready . After which he took Butter and Milk , with
the Calf that was dressed , and put before them ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.261

and he stood by them under the Tree , while they eat .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.262

And they asked him , Where is Sarah thy Wife ? Who answered , There in
the Tent . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.263

Then replied one , I will certainly return to thee according to the Time
of Life , so that behold she shall have a Son : which Sarah heard at the
Door of the Tent , that was behind him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.264

Now Abraham and Sarah were got into old Years , it being ceased for her
to be after the Manner of Women . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.265

Therefore she smiling within herself , said , Shall I have Pleasure
after I am become aged , and my Lord is old ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.266

Upon this the Lord said to Abraham ; Why does Sarah smile , saying ,
What , shall I bear indeed , when I am grown old ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.267

Is there any thing too wonderful for the Lord ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.268

At the Time appointed , according to the Season of Life , will I return
to thee , so that she shall have a Son . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.269

Yet Sarah thus denied , I did not smile , because she was afraid ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.270

and he said , No , but thou didst . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.271

At length the Men got up to go thence , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.272

and looked towards Sodom ;
{COM:head_of_relative_clause_is_subject_of_previous_token} whom Abraham
accompanied , to bring them on the Way . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.273

And the Lord says ; Shall I conceal from Abraham what I am about to do ?
Since he will fully become a great and mighty Nation , and through him
will all the Nations of the Earth be blessed .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.274

For I know that he is one who will command his Children and Family after
him , that they should observe the Way of the Lord , by doing
Righteousness and Equity ; that the Lord may bring to Abraham what he
has spoken to him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1G.275

<P_18,20G>

So he said ; Because the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great , namely
that their Sin is very grievous ; I am going down now , that I may see ,
whether they have done wholly according to the Cry of it that is come to
me ; or if not , I shall know . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.277

But when the Men turned from thence , that they might go to Sodom ,
Abraham stood yet before the Lord . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.278

And drawing nigh , he said : What , wilt thou destroy the Righteous with
the Wicked ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.279

Suppose there are fifty righteous ones within the City ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.280

what , wilt thou consume <font> them , <$$font> and not spare the Place
by reason of those fifty ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.281

Far be it from thee that thou shouldest do such a Thing as this , to
cause the Righteous to die with the Wicked , for the former to be the
same as the latter : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.282

let that be far from thee ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.283

will not the Judge of the whole Earth do Justice ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.284

To which the Lord said , If I find at Sodom fifty righteous ones within
the City , I will spare all the Place for their Sake .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.285

And Abraham made answer ; Behold now I would speak to the Lord , though
I am Dust and Ashes . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.286

Suppose five should be wanting of the forementioned fifty ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.287

wilt thou destroy the whole City for the five ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.288

And he said , I will not , if I find there five_and_forty .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.289

Then he proceeded to speak thus to him further , Perhaps forty may be
found there : who said , I will not do it for their Sake .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.290

In the next Place he said , Let not the Lord now be angry that I speak ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.291

perhaps thirty may be found there : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.292

I will not do <font> it <$$font> , answered he , if I find so many there
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.293

Behold now , said he again , I would speak to the Lord ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.294

Possibly twenty may be found there : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.295

then he said , I will not destroy <font> it <$$font> for them .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.296

Lastly he said ; Let not the Lord now be angry ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.297

and I will speak only this Time , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.298

There may perhaps be ten found there : to which he said , I will not
destroy it for ten@ @'s sake . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.299

And the Lord went away when he had made an end of conversing with
Abraham ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.300

and he returned to his Place . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20G.301

<P_19,1G>

Chap. XIX . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.304

<$$heading>

Now the two Angels came to Sodom in the Evening , at the Gate of which
Lot was sitting ; whom seeing , he rose up to meet them , and bowed down
with the Face to the Ground , And said , Behold now , Lord , turn aside
, I pray , to your Servant's House , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.306

lodge , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.307

and wash your Feet ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.308

then you may rise early and go on your Way : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.309

but they answered , No , for we can lodge in the Street .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.310

Yet he pressed on them so much , that they turned aside to him , and
went to his House ; where he made a Feast for them , baking unleavened
Cakes , and they eat . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.311

Before they lay down however , the Men of the City of Sodom beset the
House about , all of them both young and old , from the uttermost Part .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.312

And calling to Lot , they said to him , Where are the Men who came to
thee to_Night ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.313

Bring them out to us , that we may have the knowledge of them .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.314

Upon which Lot goes forth to them at the Gate , shutting the Door after
him , And says ; Do not wickedly , my Brethren , I beseech you .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.315

Lo now I have two Daughters who have not known a Man ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.316

them now would I bring out to you , that you may do to them what you
please ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.317

only do nothing to these Men , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.318

for therefore they came into the Shelter of my Roof .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.319

But they said , Get thee further ; adding , There is one come to sojourn
, PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.320

and he must needs judge ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.321

now will we do more wickedly to thee than to them :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.322

accordingly they pressed on that Man exceedingly ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.323

and came nigh to break open the Door . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.324

However the Men reached out their Hands , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.325

and pulled Lot into the House to them , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.326

and shut the Door . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.327

Those also who were at the Gate of the House they struck with Blindness
, both small and great ; so that they were tired of finding out the Gate
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.328

Afterwards the Men said to Lot ; Whom thou hast else here , Son-in-law ,
or thy Sons , Daughters , and all that belong to thee in the City ,
bring out of this Place . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.329

For we shall destroy it ; because their Cry is great before the Lord ,
and he has sent us to destroy it . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.330

Whereupon Lot went forth , and spoke thus to his Sons-in-law , who were
taking his Daughters , Get ready ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.331

go out of this Place , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.332

for the Lord will destroy the City ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.333

but they looked on him as if he was in jest .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.334

And as soon as it was break of Day , the Angels were urgent with Lot as
follows , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.335

Get ready , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.336

take thy Wife and two Daughters who are present , lest thou shouldest be
consumed through the Iniquity of the City . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.337

And he delaying , the Men took hold of his Hand , and those of his Wife
and two Daughters , by the Compassion of the Lord to him
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.338

and had him forth , putting him without the City . Which they had no
sooner done , but one cries , Escape for thy Life ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.339

neither look behind thee , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.340

nor stay in all the Plain : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.341

escape to the Mountain , lest thou shouldest be consumed .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.342

Whom Lot intreated ; Let not that be , I pray thee , Lord .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.343

Behold now <font> as <$$font> thy Servant is in Favour with thee , and
thou makest thy Kindness which thou shewest to me great , to save my
Life ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.344

and I can@ @not escape to the Mountain , lest Harm should overtake me ,
and I die : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1G.345

<P_19,20G>

Lo now this City is near , whither I can flee ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.347

and it is little PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.348

let me , I pray , escape thither <paren> is it not a little one ?
<$$paren> that my Life may be saved . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.349

And he replied to him ; Behold I accept thy Person also in this Thing ,
that I will not overthrow the City of which thou speakest .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.350

Make haste , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.351

escape to it ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.352

for I can do Nothing till thou art got thither ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.353

therefore the City was named Zoar . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.354

The Sun came forth above the Horizon when Lot reached Zoar .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.355

Then the Lord made it rain Brimstone and Fire , upon Sodom and Gomorrah
, from him out of Heaven . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.356

Thus he overthrew those Cities , with the whole Plain , and all the
Inhabitants of the Cities , as well as the Product of the Ground .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.357

But his Wife looking behind him , became a Pillar of Salt .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.358

And Abraham went early in the Morning , to the Place where he stood
before the Lord . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.359

When looking towards Sodom and Gomorrah , and towards all the Country of
the Plain , he saw clearly that the Smoak of the Country went up , like
that of a Kiln . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.360

Yet when God destroyed the Cities of the Plain , he remembered Abraham ,
sending Lot from within the Overthrow , when he overthrew the Cities in
which he dwelt . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.361

Lot afterwards went up from Zoar , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.362

and dwelt on the Mountain , having his two Daughters with him , because
he was afraid to dwell in Zoar ; where he and they abode in a Cave .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.363

And the First-born said to the Youngest ; Our Father is old ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.364

and there being no Man in the World to come in to us after the manner of
the whole Earth ; Come , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.365

let us make him drink Wine , and lie with him , that we may cause
Offspring to live from our Father . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.366

Accordingly they made their Father drink Wine that Night ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.367

and the First-born went in , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.368

and lay with him ; who knew not when she lay down , nor when she got up
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.369

On the next Day likewise she said to the other , Lo I lay last Night
with my Father ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.370

let us make him drink Wine also to_Night , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.371

and go thou in , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.372

lie with him , that we may cause Offspring to live from our Father .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.373

So they made their Father drink Wine too that Night ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.374

and the Youngest got ready , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.375

and lay with him ; who knew not when she lay down , nor when she got up
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.376

And Lot's two Daughters conceiving by their Father ; The First-born bore
a Son , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.377

and named him Moab ; who is the Father of the Moabites to this Day .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.378

And the Youngest also bore a Son , whom she named Ben-ammi ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20G.379

he is the Father of the Ammonites to this Day .

And Abraham travelled from thence to the South-country ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.385

and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur , sojourning in Gerar .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.386

And he reporting of Sarah his Wife , She is my Sister ; Abimelech King
of Gerar sent , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.387

and took her . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.388

But God came to him in a Dream by Night , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.389

and said to him , Behold thou art a dead Man because of the Woman whom
thou hast taken , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.390

for she has a Husband . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.391

Nevertheless Abimelech having not come near her , pleaded ; Lord , wilt
thou slay even a righteous Nation ? Did not he tell me , She is my
Sister ? And she too her self said , He is my Brother : in the
Integrity of my Heart , and Innocency of my Hands , I did this . To
whom God replied in the Dream ; Yes , I knew that thou didst it in the
Integrity of thy Heart , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.392

and I also with-held thee from sinning against me :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.393

therefore I did not let thee meddle with her .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.394

So now restore the Man's Wife ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.395

for he is a Prophet , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.396

and will pray for thee PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.397

and do thou live : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.398

but if thou dost not restore <font> her <$$font> , know that thou shalt
quite die , with every one whom thou hast . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.399

With this Abimelech got up early in the Morning ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.400

and calling all his Servants , related all these Words in their Hearings
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.401

and the Men were exceedingly afraid . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.402

He likewise called Abraham , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.403

and said to him , What hast thou done to us ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.404

And wherein had I offended thee , that thou . wouldest have brought a
great Sin upon me and my Kingdom ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.405

Thou hast done to me Deeds which should not be done .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.406

What didst thou see , continued Abimelech to him , that thou hast done
this Thing ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.407

To which Abraham answered ; It was because I thought there was no Fear
of God at all in this Place , and they would slay me for my Wife's Sake
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.408

Nay she is also indeed my Sister , my Father's Daughter , but not my
Mother's , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.409

and I had her for a Wife . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.410

And when God made me wander from my Father's House , I said to her ;
This is thy Kindness which thou shalt do to me ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.411

at every Place whither we shall come , report of me , He is my Brother .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.412

Then Abimelech took Sheep , Oxen , Servant-men and Maids ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.413

and gave to Abraham ; restoring to him Sarah his Wife .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.414

Moreover he said , Behold my Country is before thee ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.415

dwell where it pleases thee . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.416

Besides he said to Sarah , Lo I give thy Brother a_thousand <font>
Shekels <$$font> of Silver , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.417

behold it is to thee a Covering of the Eyes for all who are with thee ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.418

and all was that she might be reproved . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.419

Afterwards Abraham prayed to God ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.420

and he cured Abimelech , with his Wife and Handmaids , so that they bore
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.421

For the Lord had fast shut up every Womb of his Family , upon the
account of Sarah Abraham's Wife . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1G.422

<P_21,1G>

<heading>

Chap. XXI . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.425

<$$heading>

And the Lord visited Sarah as he had promised , doing for her according
as he spoke . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.427

For she conceived , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.428

and bore Abraham a Son in his old Age , at the set Time that God had
told him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.429

And he named his Son , whom he had born to him by her , Isaac . Whom he
circumcised on his eighth Day , as God commanded him . He himself being
in his hundredth Year , when he was born to him .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.430

And Sarah said , God has made me to be smiled about ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.431

every one who hears <font> it <$$font> will smile concerning me .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.432

Who , says she , would have spoken to Abraham of Sarah's giving Children
suck ? because I have born a Son in his old Years .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.433

At length the Child being grown , so that it should be weaned , Abraham
made a great Feast the Day that was done . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.434

And Sarah seeing the Son of Hagar the Egyptian , whom she bore to him ,
making sport ; She said to Abraham , Drive out this Maidservant and her
Son : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.435

for he shall not inherit along with my Son Isaac . Which Thing Abraham
was much displeased with , by reason of his Son .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.436

But God said to him , Be not displeased concerning the Youth and thy
Handmaid ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.437

in all that Sarah has expressed to thee , hearken to what she says :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.438

for of Isaac shall be called thy Offspring .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.439

Yet I will also make the Son of the Handmaid a Nation , because he is
the Offspring of thee . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.440

So Abraham got up early in the Morning , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.441

and took Bread and a Bottle of Water , which he gave to Hagar <paren>
putting <font> it <$$font> on her Shoulder <$$paren> with the Boy ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.442

and sent her away ; who went and wandered in the Wilderness of
Beer-sheba . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.443

And when the Water was consumed out of the Bottle , she cast the Boy
under one of the Shrubs . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.444

Then she went , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.445

and sat {TEXT:sate} her self down at a Distance , about a Bowshot off ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.446

for she said , Let me not see the Child's Death ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.447

and sitting there , she burst out a crying .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.448

And God hearing the Lad's Voice , the Angel of God calls to Hagar from
Heaven , saying to her ; What is the matter with thee , Hagar ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.449

Do not fear , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.450

for God has hearkened to the Voice of the Youth , where he is .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.451

Arise , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.452

lift him up , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.453

and hold him in thy Hand : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.454

for I will cause him to be a great Nation . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.455

Besides God opened her Eyes , so that she saw a Well of Water
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.456

and she went , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.457

and filling the Bottle with Water , gave the Lad drink .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,1G.458

<P_21,20G>

Moreover God was with him , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.460

and he grew up ; who dwelling in the Wilderness , became an Archer .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.461

And he dwelt in that of Paran ; for whom his Mother took a Wife out of
the Country of Egypt . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.462

At that Time also Abimelech spoke to Abraham , with Phichol the Captain
of his Army , as follows ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.463

God is with Thee in all that thou doest . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.464

Now therefore swear to me here by him that without dealing falsely with
me , my Son , or Grandson , thou wilt do to me , and the Country wherein
thou sojournest , according to the Kindness which I have done to thee .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.465

And Abraham answered , I will swear . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.466

But he reproved Abimelech , by reason of a Well of Water which his
Servants had forcibly taken away , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.467

However Abimelech said , I know not who did this Thing ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.468

and besides thou didst not tell <font> it <$$font> me ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.469

nor did I even hear of it , besides to_Day .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.470

Then Abraham took Sheep and Oxen , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.471

and gave to him ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.472

and they both made a Covenant . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.473

Abraham further set seven Ewe-lambs of the Flock by themselves .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.474

And Abimelech asked him , For what are these Seven Lambs here , which
thou hast set by themselves ? Who answered , That thou mayest receive
them from me , to the intent it may be a Witness for me , that I dug
this Well . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.475

Therefore he called the Place Beersheba ; because they swore there both
of them . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.476

When they had thus made a Treaty there , Abimelech rose up , with the
other , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.477

and they returned to the Country of the Philistines .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.478

But Abraham set a Tree at Beersheba , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.479

and called there on the Name of the Everlasting Lord God .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,21,20G.480

And he sojourrned in the Philistines Country a great while .

<P_15,1N>

Chap. XV . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.484

<$$heading>

The Lord afterwards told Moses as follows : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.486

Speak to the Israelites , saying to them ; When you are come into the
Country of your Habitations , which I will give you , And prepare an
Offering by Fire to the Lord , either a Burnt-offering , or a Sacrifice
, in putting apart by a Vow , or for a Free-offering , or in your
appointed Times ; to make a pleasant Smell to the Lord , out of the Herd
, or the Flock ; Let him who brings his Oblation to the Lord , bring a
Meat-offering of the tenth Part <font> of an Ephah <$$font> of fine
Flour , tempered with the fourth Part of a Hin of Oil ; And prepare for
a Drink-offering the fourth Part of a Hin of Wine ; with the
Burnt-offering or Sacrifice of a Lamb . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.487

For a Ram also prepare thou a Meat offering of two tenth Parts <font> of
an Ephah <$$font> of fine Flour , tempered with the third Part of a Hin
of Oil ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.488

And bring for a Drink-offering the third Part of a Hin of Wine ; to be a
pleasant Smell to the Lord . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.489

And when thou preparest a young one of the Herd for a Burnt-offering or
Sacrifice , in putting apart by a Vow , or for Peace-offerings to the
Lord ; Let there be brought with it a Meat-offering of three tenth Parts
<font> of an Ephah <$$font> of fine Flour , tempered with half a Hin of
Oil ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.490

And thou shalt bring for a Drink-offering half a Hin of Wine ; to be an
Offering by Fire of a pleasant Smell to the Lord .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.491

Thus shall there be prepared for a Bullock , for a Ram , for either a
Lamb or Kid ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.492

And so shall you do , as their Number is for every one , according to
the Number that you prepare . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.493

All the Natives shall do the like , when they bring an Offering by Fire
of a pleasant Smell to the Lord . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.494

When one likewise who sojourns with you , or shall be among you in your
Generations , prepares such an Offering , let it be as you your selves
do it . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.495

There shall be the same Ordinance for you of the Congregation , and for
him who sojourns , a perpetual one in your Generations ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.496

you shall be alike before the Lord , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.497

The Law and the Manner shall be the same to both of you .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,1N.498

Again the Lord spoke thus to Moses : Charge the Israelites , by saying
to them ; When you come into the Country whither I Will bring you , And
then eat of the Bread of it , you shall offer up a Lifted-offering to
the Lord ; <P_15,20N> Which shall be a Cake of the first of your Dough ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.499

and you must offer it up like a Lifted-offering out of the Flour .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.500

This Offering shall you give to the Lord in your Generations .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.501

And when you err in not doing all these Commandments , which the Lord
expressed to Moses , Whatever he has commanded you by his Ministry ,
ever since the Time that the Lord did <font> it , <$$font> in your
Generations ; Then , if it be done by the Mistake of the Assembly
through Ignorance , all of them shall prepare a young Bullock of the
Herd for a Burnt-offering , to be a pleasant Smell to the Lord , with
his Meat-offering and Drink-offering as usual , and a Kid of the Goats
<font> for <$$font> a Sin-offering . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.502

And the Priest shall make atonement for the whole Assembly of the
Israelites , that it may be forgiven them ; since it was a Mistake , and
they have brought their Oblation , an Offering by Fire to the Lord , and
their Sin-offering before him , for their Mistake .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.503

So shall they be all of them forgiven , and he who sojourns among them ,
when all the People are in a Mistake . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.504

When a single Person too sins by Mistake , he shall bring a She-goat of
the first Year for a Sin-offering . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.505

And the Priest shall make atonement for him , who has erred by sinning
in that Manner before the Lord ; that by so doing , it may be forgiven
him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.506

A Native of the Israelites , and he who sojourns among them , shall have
the same Law for committing <font> Sin <$$font> by Mistake .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.507

But that Person , either of the Natives or Strangers , who commits
<font> it <$$font> with a high Hand , reproaches the Lord ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.508

and shall be cut off from among his People :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.509

For he despising the Word of the Lord , as well as breaking his
Commandment ; that Person shall be utterly cut off ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.510

his Iniquity shall be upon him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.511

And while the Israelites were in the Wilderness , they found a Man
gathering Wood on the Sabbath Day . Whereupon those that found him
doing it , brought him to Moses , Aaron , and the whole Assembly . Who
put him in Prison , because it was not explained what should be done to
him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.512

And the Lord said to Moses , The Man shall be quite put to death :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.513

Let all the Assembly stone him with Stones without the Camp .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.514

Accordingly they had him out thither , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.515

and stoned him till he was dead ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.516

To him also spoke the Lord in the following manner ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.517

Tell the Israelites , that they should make them a Fringe upon the
Skirts of their Garments , in their Generations , and put a blue Lace
upon that . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,20N.518

And the Fringe shall be for you to look on , that you may remember all
the Commandments of the Lord , and do them ; and not seek to follow your
own Heart and Eyes , which you go a whoring after : <P_15,40N> That by
remembering and doing all my Commandments , you may be holy to your God
. Who am the Lord your God , that brought you out of the Country of
Egypt , to be a God to you : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,40N.519

I am the Lord your God . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,15,40N.520

<P_18,1N>

<heading>

Chap. XVIII . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.523

<$$heading>

Upon this the Lord said to Aaron : Thou , with thy Sons , and thy
Father's Family shall bear the Iniquity of the Sanctuary ; thou and thy
Sons your selves that of your Priesthood . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.525

So bring also thy Brethren , of the Tribe of Levi , that of thy Father ,
with thee , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.526

and let them be joined to thee , and wait on thee ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.527

but let thy Sons be with thee before the Tent of the Testimony .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.528

And the former shall take care of thy Business , and that of the whole
Tent ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.529

yet must not approach to the consecrated Things , or the Altar , that
both they and you may not die . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.530

However they shall be joined with thee , so as to look after the Affairs
belonging to all the Service of the publick Tent ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.531

and no Stranger shall come near you . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.532

Thus shall you take care of the Business both of the Sanctuary , and the
Altar ; that there may no more be Wrath upon the Israelites .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.533

Behold even I took your Brethren the Levites from among the Israelites :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.534

they are given to you a Gift for the Lord , to do the Service of the
publick Tent . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.535

But thou , and thy Sons with thee , shall take care of your Priesthood ,
about every Matter of the Altar and within the Veil , as also serve :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.536

I make your Priesthood a given Service , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.537

and the Stranger who comes near shall be put to death .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.538

Lo I give to thee , and thy Sons by a lasting Ordinance , said the Lord
to Aaron , the Charge of my Offerings , with all the consecrated Things
of the Israelites , by reason of the Anointing .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.539

The following shall be thine , and thy Sons , of the Things <font> saved
<$$font> from the Fire that are very holy ; all their Oblations , of all
their Meat-offerings , Sin-offerings and Trespass-offerings , which they
render to me ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.540

Thou <font> and <$$font> every Male shall eat them at the very Holy
Place , they being holy to thee . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.541

These shall likewise be thine ; their given Lifted-offering , with all
the Waved-offerings of the Israelites which I give both to thy Sons and
Daughters , together with thee , by a lasting Ordinance :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.542

every one of thy own Family who is clean may eat of the same .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.543

I give thee all the first and best of the Oil , as also of the new Wine
and Wheat , which they shall give to the Lord .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.544

The First-fruits of all that is in their Country , which they bring to
the Lord , shall be thine : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.545

every one of thy own Family who is clean may eat of them .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.546

Thou shalt have every dedicated Thing in Israel .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.547

Every one that comes first out of the Womb , of all Flesh which they
bring to the Lord , whether of Man or Beast , shall be thine :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.548

however a first-born Child , shalt thou redeem , as thou shalt the
Firstling of an unclean Beast . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.549

And the Redemption of a Child shall be from his Month , which thou shalt
value at five holy Shekels of Silver , each being twenty Gerahs .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.550

But the Firstling of a Cow , with that of a Sheep or Goat , shalt thou
not redeem , they being consecrated : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.551

thou shalt sprinkle their Blood upon the Altar , and burn their Fat , to
be an Offering by Fire , for a pleasant Smell to the Lord .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.552

And their Flesh shall belong to thee , as both the waved Breast , and
the right Shoulder do . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.553

All the Offerings of the consecrated Things , which the Israelites shall
offer up to the Lord , do I give thee , together with thy Sons and
Daughters , by a lasting Ordinance : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.554

it shall be a lasting Covenant of Salt before the Lord , both to thee ,
and thy Offspring with thee . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,1N.555

<P_18,20N>

Thou shalt not possess any Thing in the Country of the Israelites ,
added the Lord to Aaron , nor have a Part among them :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.557

I will be thy Part and Possession there . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.558

And behold , I give the Posterity of Levi all the Tithe in Israel for a
Possession ; for their Service of the publick Tent , which they do .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.559

So let the Israelites no more approach the publick Tent , to die by
bearing Sin . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.560

For the Levites shall do the Service of it , and bear their Iniquity .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.561

It shall be a lasting Ordinance to your Generations , that they shall
have no Possession among the Israelites . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.562

The reason , I say of them , that they shall have no Possession among
the Israelites is , because I give them their Tithe for a Possession ,
which the others shall offer up <font> for <$$font> an Offering to the
Lord . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.563

Besides the Lord said to Moses as follows : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.564

Speak also to the Levites , saying to them ; When you receive the Tithe
of the Israelites , which I give you for your Possession from them , you
shall offer up the Tithe of that , for an Offering out of it to the Lord
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.565

And your Offering shall be counted to you as <font> that <$$font> of
Corn out of the Floor , and of Liquor out of the Wine-press .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.566

Now you must offer up such an Offering to the Lord , out of all your
Tithes which you receive of the Israelites , giving it to Aaron the
Priest . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.567

Every Offering that you offer up to the Lord out of all your Gifts ,
shall be of all the best of them , which is to be their consecrated Part
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.568

Say therefore to them ; When you have offered up the best of them , let
them be counted to the Levites as the Increase of the Floor , and that
of the Wine-press . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.569

Then you and your Families may eat them in any Place :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.570

for they shall be your Reward for your Service in the publick Tent .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.571

And when you offer up the best of them , you shall bear no Sin
concerning them , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.572

nor will you profane the Israelites consecrated Things ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.573

and so shall not die . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,18,20N.574

Chap. XIX . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.577

<$$heading>

The Lord further said thus , as well to Aaron as Moses , That the
following was an Ordinance of the Law which he himself commanded :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.579

Tell the Israelites , that they should fetch thee a perfect red Heifer ,
in which is no Blemish , <font> and <$$font> upon which there has come
no Yoke . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.580

And her you shall give to Eleazer the Priest , who shall have her forth
without the Camp , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.581

and she shall be killed before him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.582

Then let him take some of her Blood with his Finger , and sprinkle it
over against the Front of the publick Tent seven times .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.583

Next the Heifer shall be burnt in his Sight , with her Skin , Flesh ,
Blood and Dung . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.584

Moreover the Priest shall take Cedar-wood , Hyssop and scarlet Thread ,
and cast into the midst of her Burning . As he shall also wash his
Cloaths , and bathe his Flesh in Water ; after which he may come into
the Camp , but shall be unclean till the Evening .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.585

Nay he who has burnt her , shall both wash his Cloaths and bathe his
Flesh in Water , and be unclean till the Evening .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.586

And a clean Person shall gather up , and lay the Ashes of the Heifer in
a clean Place without the Camp ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.587

so they shall be to the Assembly of the Israelites for a Water of
Separation , which shall be kept for Sin . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.588

He likewise who gathers up her Ashes shall wash his Cloaths , and be
unclean till the Evening . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.589

This shall be a lasting Ordinance to the Israelites , and to him who
sojourns amongst them . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.590

He that touches the dead Body of any Man shall be unclean seven Days .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.591

On the third Day he shall purify himself with this , and on the seventh
Day be clean ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.592

but if he does not purify himself on the third Day , he shall not be
clean on the seventh . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.593

What Person soever touches the dead Body of a Man who is deceased , and
does not purify himself , will defile the Tabernacle of the Lord ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.594

and shall be cut off from Israel : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.595

when the Water of Separation is not sprinkled on him , he is unclean ,
with his Uncleanness still upon him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.596

This shall be the Law when a Man dies in a Tent :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.597

All who come into the Tent , and all who are in it , shall be unclean
seven Days . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.598

And every open vessel , upon which there is no Cloth fastened , shall be
unclean . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.599

Whoever also touches abroad upon the Ground , one who is killed with a
Sword , or dead , a Bone of a Man , or a Grave , shall be unclean seven
Days . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.600

And after they have taken for the Unclean , some of the Ashes of the
Burning for Sin , and Spring Water is put into a Vessel with them ; Let
a clean Man take hyssop , and dip in the Water , and sprinkle upon the
Tent , upon all the vessels , and Persons who were there ; upon him
likewise that has touched a Bone , or one that is slain or dead , or a
Grave . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,1N.601

Thus when the Clean has sprinkled upon him who is unclean , on the third
Day and the seventh , he shall be purified on the seventh Day ; and
washing his Cloaths , and bathing in Water , be clean in the Evening .
<P_19,20N> Whereas that Person who is unclean , and does not purify
himself , shall be cut off from among the Congregation ; when he defiles
the Sanctuary of the Lord , not having the Water of Separation sprinkled
upon him , and being unclean . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20N.602

It shall be a lasting Ordinance to you , that he who sprinkles the Water
of Separation shall wash his Cloaths , and he who touches it , be
unclean till the Evening . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,19,20N.603

Nay all which an unclean Person touches shall be unclean , as shall the
Person who touches <font> that , <$$font> till the Evening .

Chap. XX . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.607

<$$heading>

At length the whole Assembly of the Israelites came into the Wilderness
of Zin , in the first Month , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.609

and the People staid at Kadesh ; where Miriam died , and was buried .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.610

And having no Water , they gathered together against Moses and Aaron :
As also quarrelled with Moses , saying thus ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.611

Oh that we had died when our Brethren did before the Lord !
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.612

Why did you bring the Congregation of the Lord into this Wilderness ,
for we and our Cattle to die here ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.613

And why did you cause us to come up from Egypt , to bring us to this bad
Place ? Which is neither a Place of Corn , Figs , Vines , nor
Pomegranates ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.614

nay there is no Water to drink . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.615

Upon this Moses and Aaron went from the Presence of the Congregation ,
to the Door of the publick Tent , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.616

and fell on their Faces ;
{COM:head_of_relative_clause_is_subject_of_previous_token} to whom the
Glory of the Lord appearing , He said to Moses as follows ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.617

Take the Staff , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.618

and thou with thy Brother Aaron having gathered the Assembly together ,
speak you to the Rock in their Sight , that it should yield its Water :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.619

so thou shalt bring them Water out of it , and make both the Assembly
and their Cattle drink . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.620

And Moses taking the Staff from before the Lord , as he commanded him ;
When he and Aaron had gathered the Congregation before the Rock , he
said to them ; Hear now , you Rebels , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.621

can we make Water come out of this Rock for you ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.622

Then lifting up his Hand , he struck the Rock twice with his Staff ;
whereupon there came out much Water , so that the Assembly and their
Cattle drank . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.623

But the Lord declared to Moses and Aaron , Because you did not believe
me to sanctify me in the Sight of the Israelites therefore you shall not
bring this Congregation into the Country which I give them .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.624

This was the Water of Meribah , at which the Israelites contended with
the Lord , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.625

and he was sanctified through them PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.626

And from Kadesh Moses sent Ambassadors to the King of Edom , who spoke
thus in the Name of his Brother Israel ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.627

Thou knowest all the Fatigue which we have met with ; That our
Forefathers went down to Egypt , where we dwelt a long time , and the
Egyptians dealt ill with us and our Fathers .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.628

But when we cried to the Lord , he heard what we said ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.629

and sending an Angel , brought us out of Egypt .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.630

And behold we are at Kadesh , a City on the outside of thy Border .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.631

Let us pass through thy Country , we pray : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.632

we will not go through the Fields , or the Vineyards , nor drink Water
out of the Wells ; <font> but <$$font> go in the King's Highway ,
without turning aside to the right Hand or the left , till we have
passed thy Bounds . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.633

To which the Edomite answered . You must not pass through what is mine
, lest I should come out to meet you with the Sword .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,1N.634

And though the Israelites replied to him , We will go up in the Road ,
and if we or our Cattle drink of thy Water , we will give to the Worth
of it ; we will do nothing else but pass along on our Feet : <P_20,20N>
Yet he said , You shall not pass ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.635

besides he came out to meet them with numerous People , and strong Power
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.636

So he refusing to give Israel leave to pass through his Bounds , they
turned away from him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.637

The whole Assembly of Israel therefore marching from Kadesh came to
Mount Hor , Which was by the Border of the Country of Edom ; where the
Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron as follows : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.638

Aaron shall be taken away to his People : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.639

for he shall not enter into the Country which I give to the Israelites ,
because you rebelled against my Command at the Water of Meribah .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.640

Take Aaron and his Son Eleazar , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.641

and have them up Mount Hor . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.642

And when thou hast pulled off Aaron's Garments , and put them on Eleazar
his Son , Aaron shall be taken away there by Death .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.643

This Moses did as the Lord commanded ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.644

and they went up Mount Hor in the Sight of the whole Assembly . On the
Top of which Aaron died , after Moses had pulled off his Garments , and
put them on his Son Eleazar ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.645

then Moses and Eleazar went down from the Mountain .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.646

And all the assembly , the whole Family of Israel , finding that Aaron
was dead , mourned for him thirty Days . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,20,20N.647

Notes upon the Book called Deuteronomy . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.650

Chap. I . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.651

<$$heading>

These are the Words which Moses spoke to all Israel , on this side
Jordan in the Wilderness , on the Plain over against Suph , between
Paran , Tophel , Laban , Ha-zeroth and Di-zahab ; There being eleven
Days <font> Journey <$$font> from Horeb , by the Way of Mount Seir , to
Kadesh-barnea . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.653

Even in the fortieth Year , on the first of the eleventh Month , did
Moses speak to the Israelites , entirely as the Lord commanded him for
them ; After he had slain Sihon King of the Amorites , who dwelt in
Heshbon , and Og King of Bashan , who dwelt in Ashtaroth , at Edrei .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.654

On this side Jordan in the Country of Moab , was Moses pleased to
declare this Law as follows . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.655

The Lord our God spoke to us thus in Horeb ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.656

You have dwelt a great deal on this Mountain :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.657

Turn about , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.658

take your journey , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.659

and go to the Mountain of the Amorites , and to all its neighbouring
Places , on the Plain , on the Mountain , and in the Vale , as also in
the South , and at the Harbour of the Sea ; the Country of the
Canaanites , and Lebanon , as far as the great River , the River
Euphrates . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.660

See , I have put the Country before you ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.661

go in , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.662

and possess the same which the Lord sware to your Forefathers Abraham ,
Isaac and Jacob , that he would give them , and their future Offspring .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.663

And I spoke thus to you at that Time ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.664

I am not able to bear you alone : The Lord your God having multiplied
you , so that behold you are this Day as the Stars of Heaven for
Multitude ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.665

<paren> The Lord God of your Fathers add to you a_thousand times as many
as you are , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.666

and bless you according as he has told you <$$paren>
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.667

How can I alone bear the Fatigue of you , your Burden and Strife ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.668

Provide you wise Men , even such as understand and know of your Tribes ,
that I may put them for the chief of you . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.669

And upon your making me this answer , The Matter which thou speakest to
be done is good ; I took the chief of your Tribes , wise and knowing Men
, whom I made the chief over you , Captains of Thousands , with those of
Hundreds , Fifties and Tens , as well as Magistrates of your Tribes .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.670

Besides I gave your Judges at the same Time the following Charge ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.671

Hear between your Brethren , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.672

and judge righteously between one Man and another , as also his
Sojourner . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.673

You shall not acknowledge Faces in Judgment , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.674

shall hear the little the same as the great , not be afraid of any one's
Face , since the Judgment is God's ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.675

and the Matter which is too hard for you , bring to me , that I may hear
it . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.676

And at that Time I commanded you all the Things which you should do .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.677

After this we marched from Horeb , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.678

and went through all that great and terrible Wilderness which you saw ,
by the Way of the Mountain of the Amorites , as the Lord our God
commanded us ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,1D.679

and we came to Kadesh-barnea . <P_1,20D> When I said to you ; You are
come to the Mountain of the Amorites , which the Lord our God gives us .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.680

See , the Lord thy God has put the Country before thee :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.681

go up , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.682

inherit , as the Lord God of thy Fathers has spoken to thee ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.683

do not fear , nor be daunted . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.684

And all of you came near to me , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.685

and proposed , Let us send Men before us , that they may search the
Country for us , and bring us back Word in what Way we should go up ,
and into what Cities we should enter . Which Thing pleasing me , I took
twelve Men from you , one Person of a Tribe ; Who turned , and ascended
the Mountain , and went to the Brook of Eshcol , spying it .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.686

And they took some of the Fruit of the Country with them ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.687

and brought {COM:null_object} down to us , as also brought us back Word
, that the Country is good which the Lord our God gives us .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.688

Nevertheless you would not go up , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.689

but rebelled against the Command of the Lord your God ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.690

And murmuring in your Tents , said ; Through the Lord's Hatred to us ,
he has brought us out of the Country of Egypt , to deliver us into the
Power of the Amorites , to destroy us . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.691

Whither should we go up ? Our Brethren having made our Hearts faint ,
by saying , The People are greater and taller than we , the Cities great
and fortified to Heaven , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.692

and we also saw the Sons of the Anakites there .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.693

However I encouraged you ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.694

Be in no dread nor fear of them . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.695

The Lord your God who goes before you will fight for you , according to
all that he did for you in Egypt before your Eyes ; As likewise what
thou hast seen in the Wilderness , how the Lord thy God carried thee as
a Man does his Child , all the Way which you went , till you came to
this Place . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.696

Yet in this Thing you did not believe in the Lord your God ; Who went
before you in the Way , to find out a Place for you to encamp in , with
Fire at Night to shew you in what Way you should go , and with a Cloud
by Day . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.697

And the Lord hearing your Words pronounced , was in a Wrath ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.698

and sware thus ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.699

Not a Person among these Men of this evil Generation shall see the good
Country , which I sware to your Forefathers I would give : Excepting
Caleb the Son of Jephunneh , who shall see it ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.700

and to him will I give the Country which he has trod on , and to his
Posterity , because he follows the Lord entirely .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.701

The Lord was likewise angry with me for your sakes ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.702

and said ; Thou also shalt not enter in there .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.703

Joshua the Son of Nun , who stands before thee ; shall enter in thither
: PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.704

strengthen him , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.705

for it is he shall make Israel possess it . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.706

As to your little ones , who you complained would be a Prey , even your
Children who now know not either Good or Evil , they shall go in thither
, PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.707

and to them will I give it , that they may inherit it .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,20D.708

<P_1,40D>

But do you turn your selves about , and march into the Wilderness , the
Way to the Red Sea . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.710

Then you made me this answer , We have sinned against the Lord ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.711

we will go up and fight , entirely as the Lord our God has commanded us
; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.712

and girding on each his Weapons of War , you were ready to go up the
Mountain . Upon which the Lord said to me ; Bid them not go up , nor
fight , since I am not among you , that you may not be smitten before
your Enemies . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.713

Accordingly I spoke to you , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.714

yet you would not hearken , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.715

but rebelling against the Lord's Command , you behaved proudly ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.716

and went up on the Mountain . Whereas the Amorites who dwelt on that
Mountain coming forth to meet you , pursued you as Bees do , and beat
you in Seir to Hormah . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.717

So you returned , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.718

and wept before the Lord ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.719

but he would not hearken to what you said , nor give ear to you .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.720

Afterwards you abode at Kadesh many Days , as those which you staid were
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,1,40D.721

<P_2,1D>

<heading>

Chap. II . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.724

<$$heading>

We then turned about , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.726

and marched into the Wilderness , the Way to the Red Sea , as the Lord
ordered me ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.727

and compassed Mount Seir many Days . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.728

At length the Lord said to me as follows : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.729

You have compassed this Mountain a great deal ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.730

turn your selves about northward . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.731

And command thou the People thus ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.732

You are about to pass at the Bounds of your Brethren the Posterity of
Esau , who dwell in Seir , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.733

and as they will be afraid of you , take great heed , Not to make war
with them : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.734

for I will not give you any of their Country , so far as to tread the
Sole of the Foot on , because I have given Mount Seir an Inheritance to
Esau . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.735

You shall buy Food of them for Money , that you may eat ; and also
purchase Water of them for Money , that you may drink .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.736

For the Lord thy God has blessed thee in all the Work of thy Hand ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.737

he has known thy going through this great Wilderness :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.738

these forty Years the Lord thy God having been with thee , thou hast
wanted Nothing . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.739

And when we passed from our Brethren the Posterity of Esau who dwelt in
Seir , from the Way of the Plain , from Elath and Ezion-geber , we
turned about , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.740

and passed the Way of the Wilderness of Moab .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.741

The Lord likewise said to me ; Thou shalt not distress the Moabites ,
nor make war with them : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.742

for I will not give thee an Inheritance of their Country , because I
have given Ar an Inheritance to the Posterity of Lot . Wherein the
Emites dwelt heretofore , a People great , many and tall , like the
Anakites . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.743

They were also counted Giants like the Anakites ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.744

and the Moabites called them Emites . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.745

The Horites too dwelt in Seir heretofore , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.746

but the Posterity of Esau succeeded them , when they had destroyed them
from their Presence , and dwelt in their room ; as Israel has done to
the Country of his Inheritance , which the Lord gave them .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.747

Now get ready , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.748

pass you over the Brook Zered : which we did accordingly .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.749

And the Time which we were going from Kadesh-barnea , until we passed
over the Brook Zered , was thirty_eight Years ; till the whole
Generation of the Warriors was consumed from within the Camp , as the
Lord sware to them . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.750

For even the Hand of the Lord was against them , to rout them from
within the Camp , till they were consumed . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.751

And when all the Warriors were consumed , by dying from among the People
, Then the Lord spoke to me as follows : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.752

Thou art passing to_Day by Ar , the Bounds of Moab .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.753

When thou comest near over against the Ammonites , do not distress them
, nor make war with them : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,1D.754

for I will not give thee an Inheritance of the Ammonites Country ,
because I have given it an Inheritance to the Posterity of Lot .
<P_2,20D> A Country of Giants that was likewise counted , Giants
dwelling in it heretofore whom the Ammonites called Zamzummites ; A
People great , many and tall , like the Anakites ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.755

but the Lord destroyed them from their Presence , so that they succeeded
them , and dwelt in their room . As he did for the Posterity of Esau
that dwell in Seir , from whose Presence he destroyed the Horites , so
that they succeeded them , and have dwelt in their room to this Day .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.756

As for the Avites , that dwelt in Ha-zerim as far as Gaza , the
Caphtorites who came out of Caphtor destroyed them ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.757

and dwelt in their room . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.758

Get ready , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.759

march , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.760

and pass over the River Arnon ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.761

see , I deliver into thy Power Sihon the Amorite King of Heshbon , and
his Country : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.762

begin to inherit , and make war with him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.763

This Day will I begin to put the Dread and Fear of thee , upon the
Persons of the People under the whole Heaven ; who hearing the News of
thee , shall tremble , and be in anguish by reason of thee .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.764

And I sent Messengers from the Wilderness of Kedemoth , to Sihon King of
Heshbon , with these peaceable Words ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.765

Let me pass through thy Country ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.766

I will go all along in the Way , neither turning aside to the right Hand
, nor the left . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.767

Thou shalt sell me Food for Money , that I may eat ; and give me Water
for Money , that I may drink : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.768

only let me pass through on my Feet ; <paren> As the Posterity of Esau
who dwell in Seir , and the Moabites who dwell in Ar , did to me
<$$paren> till I shall pass over Jordan , into the Country which the
Lord our God gives us . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.769

But that King would not let us pass through what was his :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.770

for the Lord thy God let his Spirit be stubborn , and his Heart be stout
, that he might deliver him into thy Power , as it is this Day .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.771

And the Lord said to me , See , I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his
Country before thee ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.772

begin to inherit , that thou mayest do it . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.773

So Sihon and all his People came out to meet us , in Battle at Jahaz .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.774

And the Lord our God delivered him up before us , so that we killed him
, his Children , and all his People . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.775

We also took all his Cities at the same Time ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.776

and utterly destroyed of every City the Men , Women and Children ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.777

we left none remaining . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.778

Only we made the Beasts our prey , and the Spoil of the Cities which we
took . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.779

From Aroer which is upon the Bank of the River Arnon , and the City that
is in the River , even to Gilead , there was not a Town which was
superior to us : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.780

the Lord our God delivered up all before us .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.781

Only thou didst not approach the Country of the Ammonites , any Place of
the River Jabbok , or the Cities of the Mountain , or where-ever the
Lord our God forbade us . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,2,20D.782

<P_3,1D>

<heading>

Chap. III . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.785

<$$heading>

Next we turned about , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.787

and went up the Way to Bashan ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.788

and Og King of it , with all his People , came out to meet us in War ,
at Edrei . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.789

But the Lord said to me , Do not fear him : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.790

for I will deliver him , with all his People , and Country into thy
Power ; to whom thou shalt do , as thou didst to Sihon King of the
Amorites , who dwelt in Heshbon . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.791

Accordingly the Lord our God delivered also into our Power Og King of
Bashan , and all his People ; whom we killed , till there was none left
remaining to him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.792

And we took all his Cities at the same Time , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.793

there was not a Town which we did not take away from them ; being sixty
Cities , the whole Region of Argob , the Kingdom of Og in Bashan .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.794

All these Cities were fortified with a high Wall , Gates and Bars ,
besides very many Towns . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.795

And we utterly destroyed them , according to what we did to Sihon King
of Heshbon , namely the Men , Women , and Children of every City .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.796

However we made all the Beasts , and the Spoil of the Cities our prey .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.797

Thus we took away at that Time out of the Power of the two Kings of the
Amorites , the Country which is on this side Jordan , from the River
Arnon to Mount Hermon ; <paren> The Zidonians calling Hermon Shirion ,
and the Amorites calling it Shenir <$$paren> All the Cities of the Plain
, with all Gilead , and all Bashan , to Salchah and Edrei , Cities of
the Kingdom of Og in Bashan . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.798

For only Og King of Bashan was left of the Residue of the Giants ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.799

behold his Bedstead was an iron one , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.800

is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites ? It being nine Cubits long , and
four wide , by a Man's Cubit . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.801

And this Country which we inherited at that Time , from Aroer which is
by the River Arnon , and half Mount Gilead , with its Cities , I gave to
the Reubenites and Gadites . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.802

The rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , the Kingdom of Og , I likewise
gave to half the Tribe of Manasseh ; the whole Region of Argob in all
Bashan , which was called The Country of Giants .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.803

Jair the Descendant of Manasseh took the whole Region of Argob , to the
Bounds of the Geshurites and Maachathites ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.804

and has called them by his own Name The Bashan-Towns of Jair to this Day
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.805

And on Machir I bestowed Gilead : As I did on the Reubenites and Gadites
, from Gilead to the River Arnon , the middle of the River , being the
Bounds , and to Jabbok a River the Bounds of the Ammonites ; With the
Plain , and Jordan which was the Bounds , from Cinnereth to the Sea of
the Plain , the Salt Sea , under the Streams of Pisgah eastward .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.806

Whom I commanded at that Time as follows ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.807

The Lord your God having given you this Country to inherit it , you
shall pass over armed before your Brethren the Israelites , all who are
able Persons . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,1D.808

Only your Wives , Children and Cattle , of which last I know that you
have many , shall abide in your Cities which I have given you ;
<P_3,20D> Till the Lord has made your Brethren rest like your selves ,
and they likewise inherit the Country which the Lord your God gives them
beyond Jordan ; when you shall return to your respective Inheritances ,
which I have conferred upon you . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.809

Besides I commanded Joshua thus at that Time ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.810

Thy Eyes having seen all which the Lord your God did to these two Kings
, so will the Lord do to all the Kingdoms whither thou art passing .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.811

Do you not fear them : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.812

for the Lord your God himself will fight for you .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.813

I also made the following supplication to the Lord at that Time ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.814

O Sovereign Lord , thou hast begun to shew thy Servant thy Greatness and
strong Hand ; on which Account who is God in Heaven or Earth , that can
do according to thy Works and Power ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.815

Let me pass over , I beseech thee , and see the good Country which is
beyond Jordan , that good Mountain , and Lebanon .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.816

Nevertheless the Lord being in a Wrath with me by reason of you , would
not hearken to me , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.817

but said to me ; It is a great deal for thee ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.818

speak no more to me of this Matter . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.819

Ascend to the Top of Pisgah , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.820

and look up westward , northward , southward and eastward ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.821

and see with thy Eyes ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.822

but thou shalt not pass over this Jordan . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.823

However command Joshua , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.824

nay encourage and strengthen him : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.825

for he shall pass over before this People , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.826

and he shall make them possess the Country which thou shalt see .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.827

So we abode in the Valley over against Beth-peor .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,3,20D.828

<P_4,1D>

<heading>

Chap. IV . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.831

<$$heading>

Now therefore , Israel , hearken to the Ordinances and Rules , which I
teach you to do ; in order that you may live , go in , and inherit the
Country which the Lord God of your Fathers gives you .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.833

You shall neither add to the Word which I command you , nor diminish
from it ; that you may observe the Commandments of the Lord your God ,
which I command you . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.834

You saw with your own Eyes what the Lord did by reason of Baal-peor :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.835

for every Man who went after Baal-peor , him the Lord thy God destroyed
from among you . Whereas you who cleaved to the Lord your God , are all
of you alive this Day . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.836

See , I have taught you Ordinances and Rules , as the Lord my God
commanded me ; that you may do so within the Country , whither you are
going in to inherit it . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.837

Observe them , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.838

and do <font> them , <$$font> since it will be your Wisdom and
Understanding in the Sight of the People , who upon hearing all these
Ordinances , will say , This great Nation only is a wise and
understanding People . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.839

For what great Nation is there that has a god so near to it , as the
Lord our God is , in all that we call upon him for ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.840

And what great Nation is there that has such righteous Ordinances and
Rules , as this whole Law which I put before you to_Day ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.841

Only take heed to thy self , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.842

and keep thy Soul thoroughly , lest thou shouldest forget the Things
which thy Eyes have seen , and lest they should depart from thy Mind any
of the Days of thy Life ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.843

but cause thy Children and Grandchildren to know them ; <font>
Particularly <$$font> the Day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God
at Horeb , when the Lord said to me , Gather me the People together ,
and I will let them hear my Words , that they may learn to fear me all
the Days which they live upon the Earth , and may teach their Children .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.844

So you came near , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.845

and stood under the Mountain ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.846

and it burnt with Fire to the midst of Heaven , with Darkness , Clouds
and Mist . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.847

And the Lord spoke to you from within the Fire ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.848

you hearing the Words pronounced , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.849

but saw no Likeness along with it . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.850

And he declared to you his Covenant , which he commanded you to perform
, the ten Commandments , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.851

and wrote them upon two Tables of Stone . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.852

Besides the Lord commanded me at that Time , to teach you Ordinances and
Rules , that you might do them in the Country , whither you pass over to
inherit it . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,1D.853

Therefore take great heed to your Souls since you saw no Likeness on the
Day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb , from within the Fire : Lest you
should be corrupted , and make you a carved Image , the Likeness of any
Image , the Shape of Male or Female , The Shape of any Beast which is on
the Earth , the Shape of any winged Fowl which flies in the Air , The
Shape of any Thing that creeps on the Ground , the Shape of any Fish
which is in the Water under the Earth ; And lest thou shouldest look up
to Heaven , and seeing the Sun , Moon and Stars , the whole Army of it ,
shouldest be driven to bow down to them , and serve them ; which the
Lord thy God has distributed to all the People under the whole Heaven .
<P_4,20D> Whereas the Lord took you , and brought you out from the iron
Furnace , out of Egypt , that you might be a People possessed by him ,
as it is this Day . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.854

Moreover the Lord was angry with me upon your account ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.855

and sware that I should not pass over Jordan , nor enter into the good
Country which the Lord thy God gives thee <font> for <$$font> a
Possession . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.856

Though I must die in this Country , not passing over Jordan ; yet you
are to pass over , and inherit that good Country .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.857

Take heed to your selves , lest you should forget the Covenant of the
Lord your God , which he made with you , and make you a carved Image ,
the Likeness of any Thing that the Lord thy God has forbid thee .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.858

For the Lord thy God is a consuming Fire , a zealous God .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.859

When thou hast begot Children and Grandchildren , and you are become old
in the Country , and are corrupt , making a carved Image , the Likeness
of any Thing , and doing what the Lord thy God is displeased with , to
provoke him ; I call to_Day Heaven and Earth to give Evidence against
you , that you shall speedily quite perish from the Country whither you
pass over Jordan to inherit it ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.860

you shall not have a long Time in it , but be utterly destroyed .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.861

The Lord will also disperse you among the People ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.862

and you will be left a few Persons in the Nations , whither he will lead
you . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.863

And there you will serve gods the Work of Men's Hands , Wood and Stone ,
that neither see , hear , eat , nor smell . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.864

However upon thy enquiring for the Lord thy God from thence , thou shalt
find <font> him , <$$font> when thou seekest him with thy whole Heart
and Soul . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.865

When thou art distressed , and all these Things meet with thee in the
latter Days , and thou returnest to the Lord thy God , hearkening to
what he says ; As the Lord thy God is a merciful God , he will not
neglect thee , nor destroy thee ; neither forget the Covenant of thy
Forefathers , which he sware to them . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.866

For ask now of the former Days which were before thee , since the Day
that God created Man upon the Earth , and from one End of the Heaven to
the other , whether there has been the like of this great Thing , or
been heard comparable to it . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.867

Has a People heard the Voice of God speaking from within the Fire , as
thou hast , and lived ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.868

Or has God tried to come , to fetch him one Nation out of the midst of
another , by Trials , Signs , Miracles , War , a strong Hand , an Arm
stretched out , and great Terrors , according to all which the Lord your
God did for you in Egypt before your Eyes ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.869

It was shewn to thee , that thou mightest know that the Lord himself is
God , there being none else besides him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.870

He made thee hear his Voice from Heaven , that he might instruct thee ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.871

and shewed thee his great Fire upon the Earth , from within which thou
heardest his Words . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.872

And forasmuch as he loved thy Forefathers , he chose their Offspring
after them , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.873

and brought thee out of Egypt in his own Presence , by his great Power :
To expel Nations , greater and stronger than thou , from thy Presence ;
that he may bring thee in , to give thee their Country <font> for
<$$font> a Possession , as it is this Day . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.874

So know to_Day , and recall to thy Mind , that the Lord himself is God
in Heaven above , and upon the Earth below , there being none else .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,20D.875

<P_4,40D>

Do thou therefore observe his Ordinances and Commandments , which I
command thee to Day , that it may be well with thee , and thy Children
after thee , and in order that thy Time may be long in the Country which
the Lord thy God gives thee , continually . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,40D.877

Then Moses put apart three Cities on this side Jordan , towards the
Sun-rising ; For the Man-slayer to flee thither , who should kill his
Neighbour unawares , when he did not hate him in time past , that
fleeing to one of them , he might live ; <font> Namely <$$font> Bezer in
the Wilderness , in the Country of the Plain belonging to the Reubenites
, Ramoth in Gilead belonging to the Gadites , and Golan in Bashan to the
Manassites . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,40D.878

And this is the Law which Moses put before the Israelites :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,40D.879

These are the Testimonies , Ordinances and Rules , which he spoke to
them , when they were come out of Egypt ; On this side Jordan , in the
Valley over against Beth-peor , in the Country of Sihon King of the
Amorites who dwelt at Heshbon , whom Moses and the Israelites conquered
, when they were come out of Egypt . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,4,40D.880

And they inherited his Country , with that of Og King of Bashan , the
two Kings of the Amorites , who were on this side Jordan , at the
Sun-rising ; From Aroer which is upon the Bank of the River Arnon , to
Mount Sion , that is Hermon ; And the whole Plain on this side Jordan
eastward , to the Sea of the Plain , under the Streams of Pisgah .

Chap. V . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.884

<$$heading>

For Moses called all Israel , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.886

and said to them : Hear , O Israel , the Ordinances and Rules , which I
speak in your Hearing to_Day ; that you may learn them and observe to do
them . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.887

The Lord our God made a Covenant with us at Horeb .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.888

The Lord did not make this Covenant with our Forefathers , but with us ,
all these of our own selves who are alive here to_Day .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.889

The Lord spoke with you Face to Face on the Mountain , from within the
Fire <paren> I standing between the Lord and you at that Time , to
declare his Word to you , because you were afraid by reason of the Fire
, and did not go up on the Mountain <$$paren> as follows :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.890

I am the Lord thy God , who brought thee out of the Country of Egypt ,
from the Place of Slaves . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.891

Thou shalt have no other gods in my Presence .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.892

Thou shalt not make thee a carved Image , any Likeness either of what is
in the Heaven above , on the Earth below , or in the Water under it ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.893

<font> Thou <$$font> shalt neither bow down to them , nor serve them :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.894

for I am the Lord thy God , a zealous God , who punish Children for the
Iniquity of the Parents , even to the third and fourth <font> Generation
<$$font> of them that hate me ; But shew Kindness to Thousands , of
those who love me , and keep my Commandments .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.895

Thou shalt not take up the Name of the Lord thy God vainly :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.896

for the Lord will not let him be quit who does so .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.897

Keep the Sabbath Day holy , as the Lord thy God has commanded thee .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.898

Six Days shalt thou work , and do all thy Business .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.899

But the seventh Day being the Sabbath of the Lord thy God , neither
shalt thou , thy Son , Daughter , Servant-man , Maid , Ox , Ass , any of
thy Cattle , nor Sojourner who is within thy Gates , do any Business ;
that thy Servant-man and Maid may rest as well as thy self .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.900

And remember that thou wast a Servant in the Country of Egypt , and the
Lord thy God brought thee out from thence , by a strong Hand , and an
Arm stretched out ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.901

therefore he commands thee to keep the Sabbath Day .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.902

Honour thy Father and Mother , as the Lord thy God commands thee ; that
thy Time may be long , and that it may be well for thee , in the Country
which the Lord thy God gives thee . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.903

Thou shalt not murder . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.904

Nor shalt thou commit Adultery . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.905

Nor shalt thou steal . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,1D.906

<P_5,20D>

Nor shalt thou give Evidence against thy Neighbour falsely .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.908

Nor shalt thou covet thy Neighbour's Wife ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.909

neither shalt thou <font> covet <$$font> his House , Land , Servant-man
, Maid , Ox , Ass , or any Thing that he has .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.910

These Words the Lord spoke to your whole Congregation on the Mountain ,
from within the Fire , Cloud and Darkness , with a loud Voice ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.911

and made no Addition ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.912

he also wrote them upon two Tables of Stone ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.913

and gave them to me . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.914

And when you heard the Voice from within the Darkness , the Mountain
burning with Fire , you came near to me , all the Heads of your Tribes ,
and your Elders , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.915

And said ; Lo the Lord our God has shewn us his Glory and Greatness ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.916

and we have heard his Voice from within the Fire :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.917

this Day we have seen that God speaks to Man , and he lives .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.918

Why therefore should we now die ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.919

For this great Fire will consume us : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.920

if we hear the Voice of the Lord our God any more , we shall die .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.921

For who is there of all Flesh that has heard the Voice of the living God
, speaking from within the Fire , like us , and has lived ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.922

Go thou near , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.923

and hear all that the Lord our God shall say ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.924

then do thou speak to us all which he does to thee , that we may hear
and do <font> it . <$$font> PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.925

And the Lord hearkening to the Voice of your Words , when you spoke to
me , said to me ; I have heard the Voice of this People's Words that
they have spoken to thee , in all which they have done well .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.926

Oh that they would have this Mind , to fear me , and observe all my
Commandments at all Times ; that it may be well for them , and their
Children for ever . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.927

Go , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.928

say to them , Return to your Tents . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.929

But do thou stand here with me , that I may speak to thee all the
Commandments , the Ordinances and Rules , which thou shalt teach them ,
and they shall do in the Country that I give them to inherit it .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.930

You must therefore observe to do as the Lord your God has commanded you
, neither turning aside to the right Hand , nor the left .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.931

In all the Way which he has commanded you must ye go ; that ye may live
, and it may be well for you , and the Time may be long in the Country
which you shall inherit . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,5,20D.932

<P_6,1D>

<heading>

Chap. VI . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.935

<$$heading>

And these are the Commandments , Ordinances and Rules , which the Lord
your God commanded to teach you , to do in the Country whither you pass
to inherit it : That thou mayest fear the Lord thy God , to observe all
his Ordinances , and his Commandments , which I command thee , thy Son
and Grandson , all the Days of thy Life ; and that thy Time may be long
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.937

So thou must hear , O Israel , and observe to do ; by which it will be
well for thee , and by which thou wilt increase exceedingly : as the
Lord God of thy Fathers promised thee , <font> in <$$font> a Country
flowing with Milk and Honey . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.938

Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God is one Lord ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.939

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart , with all thy
Soul , and all thy Might . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.940

Moreover these Things which I command thee to_Day shall be in thy Heart
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.941

Besides thou shalt teach them strictly to thy Children , and speak of
them , when thou art sitting in thy House , walking in the Way , lying
down , and getting up . As also tie them for a Sign upon thy Hand ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.942

and they shall be for Frontlets between thy Eyes .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.943

Nay thou shalt write them upon the Posts of thy House , and on thy Gates
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.944

And when the Lord thy God has brought thee into the Country , which he
sware to thy Forefathers , Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , that he would
give thee , great and good Cities which thou hast not built , As
likewise Houses full of every good Thing which thou hast not filled ,
and Cisterns hewn out which thou hast not hewed , Vine-yards and
Olive-yards which thou hast not planted , so that thou eatest , and art
satisfied ; Take heed to thy self , lest thou shouldest forget the Lord
, who brought thee out of the Country of Egypt , from the Place of
Slaves . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.945

Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God , serve him , and swear by his Name .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.946

You shall not go after other gods , any of those of the People who are
round about you : Since the Lord thy God is a zealous God among you ,
lest he should be angry with thee , and destroy thee from the Surface of
the Ground . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.947

You shall not tempt the Lord your God , as you did at Massah .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.948

You shall diligently observe the Commandments of the Lord your God ,
with his Testimonies and Ordinances which he has commanded thee .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.949

And thou shalt do what the Lord approves of and likes ; that it may be
well for thee , and thou mayest go in , and inherit the good Country of
which he sware to thy Forefathers ; That he would drive away all thy
Enemies from thy Presence , as he himself spoke .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,1D.950

<P_6,20D>

When thy Son asks thee thus hereafter , For what are the Testimonies ,
Ordinances and Rules , which the Lord our God commanded you ? Thou
shalt say to him ; We were Slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,20D.952

and the Lord brought us out from thence by a strong Hand .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,20D.953

He also shewed great and grievous Signs and Miracles against Egypt ,
against Pharaoh and all his Family , in our Sight ; As well as brought
us out thence , that he might have us in , to give us the Country of
which he sware to our Forefathers . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,20D.954

Thus the Lord commanded us to do all these Ordinances , to fear the Lord
our God ; for our Good at all Times , that he may keep us alive , as at
this Day . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,6,20D.955

And it will be Righteousness to us ; when we observe to do all this
Commandment before the Lord our God , as he has commanded us .

Chap. VII . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.959

<$$heading>

When the Lord thy God has brought thee into the Country , whither thou
art going in to inherit it , and has cast out many Nations from thy
Presence , the Hittites , Girgashites , Amorites , Canaanites ,
Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , seven Nations greater and
stronger than thou ; Whom when the Lord thy God has delivered up before
thee , that thou mayest smite them ; thou shalt quite destroy them ,
shalt make no Agreement with them , nor be favourable to them .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.961

Neither shalt thou be joined to them by Marriage ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.962

<font> thou <$$font> shalt not give thy Daughter to his Son , nor take
his Daughter for thy Son . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.963

For it will turn aside thy Son from following me , that they may serve
other gods ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.964

so the Lord will be angry with you , and destroy thee quickly .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.965

But thus shall you do to them , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.966

you shall break down their Altars , break their Statues in Pieces , cut
down their Groves , and burn their carved Images in the Fire .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.967

For thou art a holy People to the Lord thy God :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.968

he has chosen thee to be a peculiar People to himself , above any other
that are upon the Surface of the Ground . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.969

The Lord neither had a love for you , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.970

nor chose you , for the Multitude of you more than any other , since you
were the fewest of all People . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.971

But for his mere Love to you , and because he would observe the Oath
which he sware to your Forefathers , the Lord brought you out with a
strong Hand , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.972

and redeemed you from the Place of Slaves , from the Power of Pharaoh
King of Egypt . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.973

Do thou know then , that the Lord thy God is God himself , a faithful
God , keeping Covenant and Kindness , with those who love him , and keep
his Commandments , to a_thousand Generations ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.974

But recompensing such as hate him , to their Face , to destroy them : he
will not delay to recompense such a one to his Face .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.975

Thou shalt therefore keep the Commandments , Ordinances and Rules ,
which I command thee this Day to do . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.976

And because you hearken to these Rules , keep and do them , the Lord thy
God will keep with thee the Covenant and Kindness , which he sware to
thy Forefathers . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.977

Nay he will love , bless , and multiply thee , as also bless the Fruit
of thy Womb and that of thy Ground , thy Corn , Wine and Oil , the Young
of thy Cows , and the Flocks of thy Sheep , in the Country which he
sware to thy Forefathers that he would give thee .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.978

Thou wilt be blessed the most of all People : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.979

there will not be among you Male or Female barren , nor among thy Cattle
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.980

And the Lord will take away all Sickness from thee ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.981

and will not lay any of the bad Diseases of Egypt , which thou knowest ,
on thee ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.982

but will put them on all who hate thee . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.983

And thou shalt consume all the People whom the Lord thy God delivers to
thee , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.984

thy Eye shall have no compassion upon them ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.985

nor shalt thou serve their gods , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.986

for it will be a Snare to thee . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.987

Though thou mayest say in thy Heart , These Nations are greater than I ,
how can I expel them ? Thou shalt not be afraid of them , remembering
well what the Lord thy God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt ; The great
Trials which thy Eyes saw , with the Signs , Miracles , the strong Hand
, and Arm stretched out , by which the Lord thy God brought thee out :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.988

so will he do to all the People , of whose Presence thou art afraid .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,1D.989

<P_7,20D>

And the Lord thy God will also send the Hornet among them , till those
who are left , and hide from thy Face , perish .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.991

Thou shalt not be in dread of their Presence :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.992

for the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee , a great and aweful God .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.993

And he will cast out those Nations from thy Presence by little and
little : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.994

thou shalt not be able to consume them quickly , lest the wild Beasts
should multiply against thee . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.995

However the Lord thy God will deliver them up before thee , and vex them
with great Vexation , till they are destroyed .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.996

He will even deliver their Kings into thy Power ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.997

and thou shalt make their Name perish from under the Heaven :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.998

there shall not a Man stand before thee , till thou hast destroyed them
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.999

The carved Images of their gods shall you burn in the Fire :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.1000

thou shalt not desire the Silver or Gold that is upon them , and take
for thy self , lest thou shouldest be in-snared by it ; because it is an
Abomination to the Lord thy God . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.1001

Nor shalt thou bring an Abomination into thy House , lest thou shouldest
be accursed like it : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.1002

thou shalt utterly detest it , and utterly abhor it , because it is
accursed . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,7,20D.1003

<P_8,1D>

Chap. VIII . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1006

<$$heading>

All the Commandments which I enjoin thee to_Day , you shall observe to
do ; that you may live , multiply , go in , and inherit the Country of
which the Lord sware to your Forefathers . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1008

And thou shalt remember the whole Way , wherein the Lord thy God has
made thee go these forty Years in the Wilderness ; in order to afflict
thee , to try thee , that it might be known what was in thy Heart ,
whether thou wouldest observe his Commandments , or not : When he
afflicted thee , and making thee hungry , caused thee to eat Manna ,
which thou didst not know , nor did thy Fathers ; that he might let thee
know that Man does not live upon Bread alone ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1009

for he lives upon all that proceeds out of the Lord's Mouth .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1010

Thy Cloaths did not wear out upon thee , nor thy Foot swell , these
forty Years . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1011

So thou mayest know with thy Heart , that as a Man chastises his Son ,
the Lord thy God chastises thee . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1012

Therefore thou shalt observe the Commandments of the Lord thy God , to
go in his Ways , and to fear him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1013

For he is bringing thee into a good Country , one of Brooks of Water ,
Fountains and Lakes , that come out both of the Vallies and Mountains ;
A Country of Wheat , Barley , Vines , Figs and Pomegranates ; a Country
of Olives for Oil , and Honey ; A Country wherein thou shalt eat
Victuals without Scarcity , not wanting any Thing in it ; a Country
whose Stones are Iron , and out of whose Mountains thou shalt dig Brass
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1014

And when thou hast eat , and art satisfied , thou shalt bless the Lord
thy God , for the good Country which he has given thee .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1015

Take heed to thy self , lest thou shouldest forget the Lord thy god ,
not to observe his commandments , Rules and Ordinances , which I command
thee to_Day : Lest when thou hast eat , and art satisfied , as also hast
built and dwellest in good Houses , When thy Herds and Flocks are
multiplied , thy Silver and Gold is multiplied to thee , and all that
thou hast is so ; Thy Heart should be exalted , and thou shouldest
forget the Lord thy God , who brought thee out of the Country of Egypt ,
from the Place of Slaves ; Who made thee go in the great and terrible
Wilderness , of fiery Serpents , Scorpions and Drought , wherein there
was no Water who brought Water for thee out of the Rock of Flint ; Who
made thee eat Manna in the Wilderness , which thy Fathers did not know ,
that he might afflict thee , and that he might try thee , to do well for
thee at thy End : And shouldest say in thy Heart , My Power , and the
Strength of my Hand has got me this Wealth .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1016

Whereas thou shalt remember the Lord thy God ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1017

for it is he gives thee Power to get Wealth ; that he may confirm his
Covenant which he sware to thy Forefathers , as it is this Day .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1018

And if thou dost at all forget the Lord thy God , go after other gods ,
serve them , and bow down to them ; I testify against you to_Day , that
you will utterly perish . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,1D.1019

<P_8,20D>

As the Nations that the Lord causes to perish from your Presence , so
will you perish , because you do not hearken to what the Lord your God
says . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,8,20D.1021

Chap. IX . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1024

<$$heading>

Hear , O Israel , thou art now about to pass over Jordan , that thou
mayest go in to inherit Nations greater and stronger than thy self ,
Cities great and fortified to Heaven ; A People great and tall , the
Sons of the Anakites , whom thou knowest , and hast heard <font> say ,
<$$font> Who can stand before the Sons of Anak ?
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1026

Know therefore now , that the Lord thy God , he who passes on before
thee , is a consuming Fire , he will destroy them , and he will bring
them down before thee ; so that thou shalt expel them , and make them
perish quickly , as the Lord has spoken to thee .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1027

Do not say thus in thy Heart , when the Lord thy God has driven them
away from before thee , For my Virtue the Lord has brought me in to
inherit this Country ; whereas for the Wickedness of these Nations the
Lord expels them from thy Presence . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1028

Neither for thy Virtue , nor the Uprightness of thy Heart , dost thou go
in to inherit their Country ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1029

but for the Wickedness of these Nations the Lord thy God expels them
from thy Presence , and that he may confirm the Matter which the Lord
sware to thy Forefathers , Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1030

So know that the Lord thy God does not give thee this good Country , to
inherit it , for thy Virtue ; since thou art a People of a stiff Neck .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1031

Remember without forgetting , how thou didst provoke the Lord thy God to
wrath in the Wilderness : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1032

even from the Time that thou camest out of the Country of Egypt , till
you arrived at this Place , you have been rebellious against the Lord .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1033

At Horeb especially you provoked the Lord to wrath , insomuch that he
was angry with you , to destroy you . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1034

When I went up the Mountain to receive the Tables of Stone , those of
the Covenant which the Lord made with you , I staid there forty Days and
forty Nights , neither eating nor drinking any Thing .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1035

And the Lord gave me two Tables of Stone written with the Finger of God
, upon which was according to all the Words that the Lord spoke to you
on the Mountain , from within the Fire , on the Day of the Congregation
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1036

And at the End of forty Days and forty Nights , the Lord giving me the
two Tables of Stone , those of the Covenant ; He said to me , Get ready
, PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1037

go down quickly from hence ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1038

for thy People whom thou hast brought out of Egypt are corrupted :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1039

they are quickly turned aside from the Way which I commanded them ,
having made them a molten Image . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1040

Besides the Lord said to me as follows ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1041

I see plainly that this People are those of a stiff Neck :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1042

Let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their Name from
under Heaven ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1043

and I will make thee a Nation stronger and greater than they .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1044

Accordingly I turned , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1045

and came down from the Mountain , which was burning with Fire ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1046

and the two Tables of the Covenant were in both my Hands .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1047

And I saw plainly that you had sinned against the Lord your God , having
made you a molten Calf : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1048

you had quickly turned aside from the Way which the Lord commanded you .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1049

Upon this I took the two Tables , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1050

and throwing them out of both my Hands , broke them in your Sight .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1051

Then I fell down before the Lord , as at first forty Days and forty
Nights , neither eating nor drinking any Thing ; for all your Sins which
you had committed , by doing what the Lord was displeased with , to
provoke him . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1052

For I was afraid by reason of the Anger and Wrath , with which the Lord
was enraged against you , to destroy you ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1053

however he hearkened to me also at that Time .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,1D.1054

<P_9,20D>

The Lord was likewise very angry with Aaron , to destroy him ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1056

but I prayed also for him at the same Time .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1057

And I took your Sin , the Calf which you had made ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1058

and burning it in the Fire , pounded it , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1059

ground it well , till it was made small into Dust ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1060

then I threw the Dust of it into the Brook that comes down from the
Mountain . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1061

Moreover at Taberah , Massah and Kibroth-hattaavah , you were provoking
the Lord to wrath . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1062

Nay when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea , to go up , and inherit
the Country which I have given you ; ye rebelled against the Command of
the Lord your God , neither believing him , nor hearkening to what he
said . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1063

You have been rebellious against the Lord , ever since I knew you .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1064

When I fell down before the Lord the forty Days and forty Nights which I
did , because he spoke of destroying you ; I prayed to the Lord in this
manner ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1065

O Sovereign Lord , do not slay thy People and Possession , that thou
hast redeemed by thy Greatness , that thou hast brought out of Egypt by
a strong Hand . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1066

Remember thy Servants , Abraham , Isaac and Jacob ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1067

do not look at the Stubbornness of this People , at their Wickedness ,
or Sin : Lest those of the Country from whence thou broughtest us out
should say , By reason the Lord was not able to bring them into the
Country which he promised them , and for his Hatred to them , he had
them out to kill them in the Wilderness . Whereas they are thy People
and Posession , that thou hast brought out by thy great Power , and Arm
stretched out . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,9,20D.1068

<P_10,1D>

<heading>

Chap. X . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1071

<$$heading>

At that Time the Lord said to me ; Carve thee out two Tables of Stone
like the former , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1073

and come up the Mountain to me ; PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1074

make thee also an Ark of Wood . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1075

And I will write upon the Tables the Words that were upon the former
ones , which thou hast broke , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1076

and thou shalt put them in the Ark . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1077

So I made an Ark of Shittim-wood , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1078

and carving out two Tables of Stone like the former , went up the
Mountain , with the two Tables in my Hand .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1079

And he wrote upon them , according to the former Writing , the ten
Commandments , which the Lord spoke to you on the Mountain , from within
the Fire , on the Day of the Congregation , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1080

and the Lord gave them to me . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1081

Then I turned , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1082

and came down from the Mountain , putting the Tables in the Ark which I
had made ; where they are , as the Lord commanded me .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1083

And the Israelites marched from the Wells of the Jaakanites to Moserah :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1084

there Aaron died , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1085

and was buried there ,
{COM:head_of_relative_clause_is_subject_of_previous_token} whose Son
Eleazar executed the Priesthood in his room .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1086

From thence they marched to Gud-godah , and thence to Jotbathah , a
Country with Rivers of Water . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1087

At that Time the Lord put apart the Tribe of Levi , to carry the Ark of
his own Covenant , to stand before himself to minister to him , and to
bless in his Name , to this Day . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1088

Therefore Levi has no Share nor Possession with his Brethren :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1089

the Lord himself is his Possession , as the Lord thy God spoke to him .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1090

And I staid on the Mountain according to the former Days , forty Days
and forty Nights ; when the Lord hearkening to me also at that Time ,
would not slay thee . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1091

On the contrary he said to me , Get ready , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1092

go to march before the People , that they may go in , and inherit the
Country , which I sware to their Forefathers that I would give them .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1093

And now , O Israel , what does the Lord thy God require of thee , but to
fear himself , to go in all his Ways , as also to love him , and serve
himself , with thy whole Heart and Soul , To observe the Commandments of
the Lord , and his Ordinances , which I command thee to_Day , for thy
own Good ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1094

Lo the Heaven and Heaven of Heavens belong to the Lord thy God , the
Earth and all that is in it : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1095

However the Lord had affection for thy Fathers to love them ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1096

and chose their Offspring after them , even you the most of all People ,
as it is this Day . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1097

Circumcise therefore the Foreskin of your Heart ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1098

and make your Neck stiff no more . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1099

For the Lord your God himself is the God of gods , and Lord of lords , a
great powerful and aweful God , who , will not respect Faces , nor take
a Bribe . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1100

He does Justice to the Fatherless and Widow ,
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1101

and loves a Stranger , to give him Food and Raiment .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1102

So do you love a Stranger , since you were such in the Country of Egypt
. PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,1D.1103

<P_10,20D>

Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God , serve him , as also cleave to him ,
and swear by his Name . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20D.1105

He is thy Praise , and he thy God , who has done for thee these great
and aweful Things , which thou hast seen with thy Eyes .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20D.1106

Thy Forefathers went down to Egypt , being seventy Persons ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20D.1107

and now the Lord thy God has made thee as the Stars of Heaven for
Multitude . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,10,20D.1108

<P_11,1D>

<heading>

Chap. XI . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1111

<$$heading>

Thou shalt therefore love the Lord thy God , and keep his Charge ,
Ordinances , Rules and Commandments , at all Times .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1113

And know ye to_Day : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1114

for it is not your Children , who have not known , and who have not seen
the Chastisement of the Lord your God , his Greatness , strong Hand ,
and Arm stretched out ; As likewise his Signs and Deeds which he did
within Egypt , to Pharaoh King of it , and his whole Country ; And what
he did to the Egyptian Army , their Horses and Chariots , how he made
the Water of the Red Sea flow over their Heads , when they pursued after
you , and the Lord has made them perish to this Day ; Moreover what he
has done for you in the Wilderness , till you arrived at this Place ;
What he did also to Dathan and Abiram , the Sons of Eliab , the Son of
Reuben , how the Earth opened its Mouth , and swallowed them up ,
together with their Families , Tents , and all living Substance that
accompanied them , in the midst of all Israel .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1115

For you have seen with your own Eyes every great Deed of the Lord ,
which he has done . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1116

So you shall keep all the Commandments , which I command thee to_Day :
that you may be strong , go in , and inherit the Country , whither you
are passing to inherit it ; And that you may have the Time long in the
Country which the Lord sware to your Forefathers , that he would give
them and their Offspring , a Country flowing with Milk and Honey .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1117

For the Country whither thou art going in to inherit it , is not like
that of Egypt , from whence you came out ; in which thou didst sow thy
Seed , and water with thy Foot , like a Garden of Herbs .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1118

But this whither you are passing to inherit it , is a Country of
Mountains and Vallies , drinking Water of the Rain of Heaven ; A Country
which is of the Lord thy God@ @'s seeking , whose Eyes are continually
on it , from the Beginning of the Year to the End of it .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1119

And if you at all hearken to my Commandments which I enjoin you to_Day ,
to love the Lord your God , and to serve him with your whole Heart and
Soul ; Then will I give Rain for your Land in its Season , the first and
latter Rain ; that thou mayest gather thy Corn , Wine and Oil .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1120

I will give Grass too in thy Field for thy Cattle ;
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1121

and thou shalt eat , and be satisfied . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1122

Take heed to your selves , lest your Heart should be enticed , and you
should turn aside , serve other gods , and bow down to them .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1123

When the Lord would be angry with you , and shut up the Heaven , so that
there should be no Rain , and the Ground would not yield its Increase :
thus would you perish quickly from the good Country which the Lord gives
you . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1124

Therefore you shall put these Words of mine in your Heart and Soul , as
also tie them for a Sign upon your Hand , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1125

and they shall be for Frontlets between your Eyes .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1126

Besides you shall teach them to your Children , by speaking of them ,
when thou art sitting at home , walking in the Way , lying down , and
getting up . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,1D.1127

<P_11,20D>

Nay thou shalt write them upon the Posts of thy House , and on thy Gates
: That your own Days and your Children's may be multiplied , in the
Country which the Lord sware to your Forefathers , that he would give
them , as the Days of Heaven upon the Earth .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1129

For if you will at all observe all these Commandments , which I order
you to do , to love the Lord your God , to go in all his Ways , and to
cleave to him ; Then will the Lord disinherit all these Nations from
your Presence , PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1130

and you shall inherit Nations greater and stronger than your selves .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1131

Every Place which the Sole of your Foot shall tread on shall be yours :
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1132

from the Wilderness and Lebanon , from that River which is Euphrates ,
even to the hindermost Sea shall your Bounds be .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1133

No Man shall stand in your Presence : PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1134

the Lord your God will put the Dread of you , and the Fear of you , upon
the Surface of the whole Country which you shall tread on , as he has
spoken to you . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1135

See , I put before you to_Day , a Blessing and a Curse : A Blessing ,
when you hearken to the Commandments of the Lord your God , which I give
you in charge to_Day ; And a Curse , if you do not , but turn aside out
of the Way which I command you to_Day , to go after other gods , that
you do not know . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1136

And when the Lord thy God has brought thee into the Country , whither
thou art going in to inherit it , thou shalt put the Blessing upon Mount
Gerizzim , and the Curse upon Mount Ebal .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1137

Are they not beyond Jordan , behind the Way of the Sun's setting , in
the Country of the Canaanites who dwell in the Plain , over against
Gilgal , by the Oaks of Moreh ? PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1138

For you shall pass over Jordan , to go in to inherit the Country that
the Lord your God gives you ; which you shall inherit , and dwell in .
PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1139

And you shall observe to do all the Ordinances and Rules , which I put
before you to_Day . PURVER-OLD-1764-2,11,20D.1140
