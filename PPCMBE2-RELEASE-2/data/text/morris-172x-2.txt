He was not well pleas'd ; MORRIS-172X-2,103.459

But said he would do neither . And if ever he Married her Daughter her
Father should give her to him . If her Father was Dead he would marry
her if she had not Fifty Pounds ; But he would never take his Daughter
from him without his Consent . That if Mrs Layng had not wheedled him ,
he should never have had anything to say to her Daughter after his Uncle
Nat: Farewell had ask'd Dr Layng's Consent ; And he would Write to him ,
& acquaint him with all her transactions . MORRIS-172X-2,103.460

5 I went about 10 à clock to Sherborn to be fully inform'd , whether the
Report of Mr Wildings excessive Severity to my Son under his
Instructions , was true . MORRIS-172X-2,103.461

I found he had been often Whipt since Christmass , but not above three
Lashes ; Not 14 at a time as he was before I had desir'd him to be more
Moderate in his Discipline . MORRIS-172X-2,103.462

Mr Wilding shew'd me , his Exercises in one of which there were 30
Literal Faultes ; but none of false Concord or very improper Words .
MORRIS-172X-2,103.463

He read about 10 lines of English , MORRIS-172X-2,103.464

and made him piece by piece turn them into Latine off hand ; Which he
did very well . MORRIS-172X-2,103.465

He then Examined him , in Latine , & Greek , being late put into the
Greek Testament ; MORRIS-172X-2,103.466

He made him Decline a Greek Verb , conjugate it through all the Moods ,
& give Account of {COM:editor_supplies_"of"} the Characteristics
{TEXT:Charistics} , & Variations which he did exactly , to the greatest
Satisfaction to me <P_104> imaginable . MORRIS-172X-2,104.467

At last Mr Wilding said , He would Compare him with any Boy in England
of his standing , & did not doubt but he should make him an incomparable
Scholar , & the best that ever went from his School .
MORRIS-172X-2,104.468

He loved him heartily : MORRIS-172X-2,104.469

For he had no Fault but one , MORRIS-172X-2,104.470

& that was he would not take Pains , which he endeavourd by his often
Whipping him to break him of , MORRIS-172X-2,104.471

& he had almost compass'd his desire . MORRIS-172X-2,104.472

If he would but search his Dictionary , they should never fall out .
MORRIS-172X-2,104.473

Mr Wilding then bid him go out a little while & divert himself ,
MORRIS-172X-2,104.474

& he would call him in again . MORRIS-172X-2,104.475

Then he shew'd me Mrs Prowses Letter which he just then received , & as
he thought by my Servant , wherein she told him of my Wife's great
Concernment & Tenderness for her Son , & what a Noise his Usage of him
had made ; & that her Friendship for Mr Wilding had occasion'd her
Writing to him . MORRIS-172X-2,104.476

He profess'd to me , He had not given him above three Lashes at a time
since I talk'd with him about it : MORRIS-172X-2,104.477

He said also I should tell his Mother he would Whip him no more .
MORRIS-172X-2,104.478

I answered him , then all would be spoil'd that way : No .
MORRIS-172X-2,104.479

I did not desire that ; But only moderate Correction , which to him a
Good-Natured & Flexible , though Lazy , Boy I hoped would be effectual .
MORRIS-172X-2,104.480

I desired also he would keep him in the School at Playtime when the
other Boys were at Liberty . MORRIS-172X-2,104.481

He said that would be {COM:editor_supplies_"be"} no manner of Punishment
to him ; MORRIS-172X-2,104.482

For he would sit in his Chamber by himself many hours together .
MORRIS-172X-2,104.483

However , I answer'd it might be grievous to him when he was forc'd to
do so . As it was to the Old Citizen <paren> in King James 1st days
<$$paren> who had never been out of the Street where he lived in 50
Years . MORRIS-172X-2,104.484

But when the King was told of this old Man , & Confined him to the same
street , he had so great a Desire for Liberty that he pined away to
Death with Grief & Inpatience for his Restraint . MORRIS-172X-2,104.485

MORRIS-172X-2,106.529

Lame ones : Because it multiplied too much Artificers & brought them to
the Army or Gallows , & abated the number of Husband-men which were
wanted in this Kingdom ; Injurd the Persons of Small Estates , by
rendering it insignificant to their Children to place them to
Handycrafts , & so press'd down the middle or inferiour People below the

By that time then we could come to the Ford above Kelston which we

And deliver'd him a Certificate from 3 Commissioners in the Division of
