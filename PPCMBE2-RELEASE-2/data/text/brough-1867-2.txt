Act I BROUGH-1867-2,3.5

<$$heading>

Scene . BROUGH-1867-2,3.7

- <font> Breakfast Room in Drewitt's House , at Richmond - an elegantly
furnished apartment with window opening <$$font> C. , <font> showing
flower garden with landscape in the distance . BROUGH-1867-2,3.8

Doors , <$$font> R. <font> and <$$font> L. BROUGH-1867-2,3.9

Jenny <font> discovered removing remains of breakfast , <$$font> R. C.
BROUGH-1867-2,3.10

Jenny . Quarter to ten , and breakfast only just over !
BROUGH-1867-2,3.11

Whatever has come to master this morning - he as used to be regularity
itself , and now he@ @'s full ten minutes and a half beyond his time ?
BROUGH-1867-2,3.12

He@ @'ll never catch his train . BROUGH-1867-2,3.13

<font> Enter <$$font> Parker , <font> dressed for driving , <$$font> L.
C. BROUGH-1867-2,3.14

Park . Good morning , Jenny dear ! BROUGH-1867-2,3.15

Pretty salubrious , eh ? BROUGH-1867-2,3.16

Jenny . Why , Parker , what@ @'s all this about ? BROUGH-1867-2,3.17

What@ @'s happened ? BROUGH-1867-2,3.18

and you dressed like that this time of day , when you ought to be
working in the garden . BROUGH-1867-2,3.19

Park . Ca@ @n't say , I@ @'m sure , Jenny - BROUGH-1867-2,3.20

it beats me ! BROUGH-1867-2,3.21

Ever since we have been here at Richmond , master has never once missed
going to town by the 9.40 ; BROUGH-1867-2,3.22

but this morning instead of walking to the station as usual , he has
ordered the brougham at ten . BROUGH-1867-2,3.23

Jenny . I hope nothing is going wrong - BROUGH-1867-2,3.24

he@ @'s a tidyish sort of master , as masters go . BROUGH-1867-2,3.25

Park . That he is , Jenny - BROUGH-1867-2,3.26

that he is ; a dooced tidyish master as you say . BROUGH-1867-2,3.27

He@ @'s only one fault - BROUGH-1867-2,3.28

he@ @'s too jealous of missis . BROUGH-1867-2,3.29

I ca@ @n't bear jealous people . BROUGH-1867-2,3.30

Jenny . It@ @'s a pity ! BROUGH-1867-2,3.31

With every comfort around him that wealth can buy , he makes himself
miserable , because he has to leave his pretty young wife alone while he
is in his office in town every day . BROUGH-1867-2,3.32

Park . No , you are mistaken ; BROUGH-1867-2,3.33

he@ @'s not unhappy through thinking his wife is left <font> alone
<$$font> , but thinking she is <font> not <$$font> alone .
BROUGH-1867-2,3.34

He fancies she may have visitors in his absence . BROUGH-1867-2,3.35

Jenny . <paren> R. <$$paren> He does ? BROUGH-1867-2,3.36

Park . <paren> L. <$$paren> Would you believe it ? BROUGH-1867-2,3.37

He has ordered me - <P_4> <paren> and promised to pay me well for my
obedience <$$paren> - to keep a sharp look out , and tell him all that
goes on while he is away . BROUGH-1867-2,4.38

Jenny . And do you tell him ? BROUGH-1867-2,4.39

Park . There@ @'s nothing to tell . BROUGH-1867-2,4.40

Missis never sees anyone except master's own personal friends -
BROUGH-1867-2,4.41

and they are mostly of the feminine gender - except , indeed , young Mr.
Honiton . BROUGH-1867-2,4.42

Jenny . But he@ @'s a relation - a sort of cousin of missis's .
BROUGH-1867-2,4.43

Park . Well , do you know , Jenny , as a rule , I do@ @n't hold with
cousins ! BROUGH-1867-2,4.44

You once introduced me to a cousin - a very tall cousin - of your own ,
him as I found sitting in Richmond Park , and in the uniform of the
Coldstream Guards , with his arm round your waist . BROUGH-1867-2,4.45

That set me against cousins , as cousins ! BROUGH-1867-2,4.46

Jenny . Take care , Parker , BROUGH-1867-2,4.47

you@ @'re getting jealous ! BROUGH-1867-2,4.48

You know you ca@ @n't bear jealous people . BROUGH-1867-2,4.49

Park . Well , so I ca@ @n't ! BROUGH-1867-2,4.50

but seeing as you and me is on the brink of matrimonial felicity -
BROUGH-1867-2,4.51

Jenny . Oh , Parker ! do you think we are really on the brink ?
BROUGH-1867-2,4.52

It seems to me we have a long pull up before us yet ; BROUGH-1867-2,4.53

there is so little to be done now in the way of perquisites , that it
takes a long time to save a modest competency . BROUGH-1867-2,4.54

Park . Tell me , Jenny , how much have you got towards the modest
competency ? BROUGH-1867-2,4.55

I@ @'ve seen a advertisement of a most eligible coffee shop - in fact ,
" The Original Early Breakfast House , coming in only 70 +L {TEXT:+L70}
. " BROUGH-1867-2,4.56

Should@ @n't you like to keep a early breakfast house ?
BROUGH-1867-2,4.57

Jenny . Well , yes , pretty well in summer time ; BROUGH-1867-2,4.58

but as for early breakfasts in winter I ca@ @n't abide 'em .
BROUGH-1867-2,4.59

I hate getting up in the dark . BROUGH-1867-2,4.60

Park . You@ @'d come to like it in time , BROUGH-1867-2,4.61

and everybody knows early breakfasting is conducive to the constitution
. BROUGH-1867-2,4.62

Jenny . Well , yes , I@ @'ve heard it@ @'s healthy .
BROUGH-1867-2,4.63

Park . Then think of the honour and glory of it . BROUGH-1867-2,4.64

The " Original " Early Breakfast House - none of your paltry copies of
it , but the original itself ! BROUGH-1867-2,4.65

Jenny . There@ @'s a good deal in that . BROUGH-1867-2,4.66

It does sound somehow respectable and old family plate-ish .
BROUGH-1867-2,4.67

Park . But what@ @'s the use of talking about it , unless we can raise
the 70 +L {TEXT:+L70} ? BROUGH-1867-2,4.68

As I said before , how much have you towards the sum required to
establish us in the holy state of matrimony and the Original Early
Breakfast House ? BROUGH-1867-2,4.69

Jenny . Only 20 +L {TEXT:+L20} odd ; BROUGH-1867-2,4.70

and you ? BROUGH-1867-2,4.71

Park . Just 10 +L {TEXT:+L10} even . BROUGH-1867-2,4.72

Jenny . Ah ! you see , as I said , we shall have to stoop beneath the
yoke some time longer . BROUGH-1867-2,4.73

But here@ @'s missis coming . BROUGH-1867-2,4.74

It@ @'s time I had these breakfast things down stairs . <font> Exit ,
<$$font> L. BROUGH-1867-2,4.75

Park . And time I had the brougham at the door . <font> Exit ,
<$$font> L. C. BROUGH-1867-2,4.76

<P_5>

<font> Enter <$$font> Mr. <font> and <$$font> Mrs. Drewitt , <font>
door , <$$font> R. Mrs. Drewitt . <paren> R. C. <$$paren> And so ,
my dear , for once you are going to transact business in your own
neighbourhood , instead of at your office . BROUGH-1867-2,5.78

Drewitt . <paren> L. C. <$$paren> As you say , my petsy_wetsy .
BROUGH-1867-2,5.79

Are you displeased ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.80

Mrs. D. Certainly not ; BROUGH-1867-2,5.81

only it seems so strange for hard practical business matters to be
discussed among the leafy beauties of Richmond , where the whole
atmosphere seems to breathe only of pleasurable repose .
BROUGH-1867-2,5.82

Business appears somehow out of place except in a mouldy fusty London
office ! BROUGH-1867-2,5.83

Drew . And are you vexed that I am a few minutes longer with you than
usual this morning , my sweetest ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.84

Mrs. D. Vexed ! BROUGH-1867-2,5.85

How could I be ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.86

Drew . Ah , very true . BROUGH-1867-2,5.87

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> Hang me if I do@ @n't think she
has an appointment to meet some one as soon as I was gone .
BROUGH-1867-2,5.88

Mrs. D. Why , what@ @'s the matter , dear ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.89

Drew . Matter ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.90

Oh ! you mean why I have not gone by train to-day as usual ?
BROUGH-1867-2,5.91

Well , you must know , a wealthy client of mine , Mr. Frank Goldsworthy
- <paren> Mrs. Drewitt <font> sits down <$$font> <$$paren> Eh ?
BROUGH-1867-2,5.92

You know him ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.93

Mrs. D. I never heard of him before . BROUGH-1867-2,5.94

Drew . Then what made you sink into a chair like that , as if the very
mention of his name overcame you ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.95

Mrs. D. Sink into a chair ! BROUGH-1867-2,5.96

what nonsense you are talking ! BROUGH-1867-2,5.97

I only took a seat because your story threatened to be a long one ;
BROUGH-1867-2,5.98

wo@ @n't <font> you <$$font> sit down ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.99

Drew . No ; I shall not detain you a minute . BROUGH-1867-2,5.100

As I was saying , Mr. Frank Goldsworthy - BROUGH-1867-2,5.101

Mrs. D. <paren> <font> rising <$$font> <$$paren> Yes !
BROUGH-1867-2,5.102

Drew . Now , what do you start up for , in that excited manner , the
moment I named him ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.103

Mrs. D. My dear , I only rose because you were not seated .
BROUGH-1867-2,5.104

Drew . Well , well , my petsy_wetsy , all right - only do keep either
sitting or standing . BROUGH-1867-2,5.105

It does fidget me so to see anybody constantly bobbing up and down .
BROUGH-1867-2,5.106

Mrs. D. Well , there . <paren> <font> removes chair away from her
<$$font> <$$paren> BROUGH-1867-2,5.107

Drew . Now , what are you knocking and shifting the furniture about for
- BROUGH-1867-2,5.108

ca@ @n't you keep still ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.109

As I was saying , my client , Mr. - Frank - Goldsworthy - <paren>
<font> he watches her closely - she stands perfectly still and silent
<$$font> <$$paren> - that@ @'s better ! - has just inherited an immense
fortune . BROUGH-1867-2,5.110

Well , a charming little estate , some two miles from this spot , being
for sale he instructed me to purchase it for him . BROUGH-1867-2,5.111

Mrs. D. Yes . BROUGH-1867-2,5.112

Drew . Yes ! why yes ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.113

What makes you take such an interest in his coming into our
neighbourhood ? BROUGH-1867-2,5.114

<P_6>

Mrs. D. Is it not right , my dear , that I should take an interest in
any business you are concerned in ? BROUGH-1867-2,6.116

Drew . True , true ! BROUGH-1867-2,6.117

A_thousand pardons , my own poppet . BROUGH-1867-2,6.118

Well the affair is so far settled that he has obtained possession , and
<paren> <font> watching her closely <$$font> <$$paren> he slept last
night , for the first time , in his new dwelling . BROUGH-1867-2,6.119

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> She does@ @n't move a muscle !
BROUGH-1867-2,6.120

What a fool I am ! BROUGH-1867-2,6.121

<paren> <font> aloud <$$font> <$$paren> Kiss me , my pet .
BROUGH-1867-2,6.122

Mrs. D. Good_bye , dear . <paren> <font> kisses him <$$font>
<$$paren> BROUGH-1867-2,6.123

Drew . Good_bye ! BROUGH-1867-2,6.124

You seem in a monstrous hurry to get rid of me . BROUGH-1867-2,6.125

Mrs. D. Not at all ; BROUGH-1867-2,6.126

but I thought you had finished , and were going . BROUGH-1867-2,6.127

Drew . Now , there again ; BROUGH-1867-2,6.128

any one would say I was inclined to jealousy , catching you up like that
. BROUGH-1867-2,6.129

Mrs. D. Jealousy ! BROUGH-1867-2,6.130

You jealous ? BROUGH-1867-2,6.131

Absurd . BROUGH-1867-2,6.132

Drew . Kiss me again , my poppet ! <paren> <font> kisses her <$$font>
<$$paren> BROUGH-1867-2,6.133

There are still some final arrangements to go through ,
BROUGH-1867-2,6.134

and I have to call upon Mr. Goldsworthy this morning , to get a cheque
to settle everything . BROUGH-1867-2,6.135

Mrs. D. And what sort of a person is this Mr. Goldsworthy ?
BROUGH-1867-2,6.136

Drew . A most excellent young man . BROUGH-1867-2,6.137

His only defect seems to be that he is endowed in an unusual degree with
what phrenologists call the bump of benevolence . His only fault a
lavish , unbounded generosity . BROUGH-1867-2,6.138

Since he has come into his fortune , it matters not who may want his aid
- BROUGH-1867-2,6.139

even the most perfect strangers - let Goldsworthy but take it into his
head that the object is a deserving one , his purse and his time are
both at their disposal , as if there were no end to either .
BROUGH-1867-2,6.140

Mrs. D. <paren> <font> laughing <$$font> <$$paren> Take care , my dear
; BROUGH-1867-2,6.141

really the way in which you praise this new client of yours is almost
enough to make me fall in love with him . BROUGH-1867-2,6.142

Drew . What , do you mean to say that you - BROUGH-1867-2,6.143

Mrs. D. I mean to say that if he were a perfect angel , I could never
love any one but you - you dear old goose - BROUGH-1867-2,6.144

and you know it . BROUGH-1867-2,6.145

Drew . Of course I do . BROUGH-1867-2,6.146

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> What an ass I am .
BROUGH-1867-2,6.147

<paren> <font> aloud <$$font> <$$paren> Kiss me again , my poppet .
BROUGH-1867-2,6.148

<font> Enter <$$font> Jenny , L. Jenny . <paren> <font> announcing
<$$font> <$$paren> Mr. Honiton , sir . BROUGH-1867-2,6.149

Drew . Honiton ! BROUGH-1867-2,6.150

shew him in ; BROUGH-1867-2,6.151

your mistress will entertain him . BROUGH-1867-2,6.152

I have a particular appointment . <font> Exit <$$font> Jenny , L.
BROUGH-1867-2,6.153

Mrs. D. <paren> <font> laughing <$$font> <$$paren> And you are not
afraid of leaving me alone with a good-looking fellow young like Arthur
? BROUGH-1867-2,6.154

Who says my husband is jealous ? BROUGH-1867-2,6.155

Drew . Jealous ! I ! BROUGH-1867-2,6.156

Do@ @n't be absurd , my pet ; BROUGH-1867-2,6.157

I may have <P_7> odd notions at times , BROUGH-1867-2,7.158

but jealous ! and of Arthur too - your own near relative - one that I
have known since he was not higher than that . <paren> <font>
indicating a little child <$$font> <$$paren> BROUGH-1867-2,7.159

Mrs. D. Nonsense , my dear , you know I was only joking .
BROUGH-1867-2,7.160

<font> Enter <$$font> Honiton , L. Honiton . Good morning , Mr.
Drewitt . BROUGH-1867-2,7.161

Cousin Maud , how are you ? BROUGH-1867-2,7.162

Drew . Good morning , my lad ; BROUGH-1867-2,7.163

you must@ @n't mind me , BROUGH-1867-2,7.164

business calls me away . BROUGH-1867-2,7.165

But Maud will do the talking for us both . BROUGH-1867-2,7.166

Bye , bye , <paren> <font> going <$$font> <$$paren> BROUGH-1867-2,7.167

Mrs. D. <paren> <font> following him <$$font> Excuse me one moment ,
Arthur . BROUGH-1867-2,7.168

<paren> <font> to <$$font> Drewitt <$$paren> What time will you be home
, dear ? BROUGH-1867-2,7.169

Drew . <paren> <font> turning sharply <$$font> <$$paren> Why do you ask
? BROUGH-1867-2,7.170

Mrs. D. <paren> <font> surprised <$$font> <$$paren> Why !
BROUGH-1867-2,7.171

Drew . Oh ! there I go again ! BROUGH-1867-2,7.172

Bye , bye , my precious . BROUGH-1867-2,7.173

Arthur , lad , good morning . <font> Exit <$$font> , Mrs. Drewitt
<font> following <$$font> , L. C. BROUGH-1867-2,7.174

Honi. He little knows how great a service he is doing me by leaving me
to talk alone with my dear cousin Maud ; BROUGH-1867-2,7.175

never in my life have I stood so much in need of her kind sisterly
advice and consolation . BROUGH-1867-2,7.176

<font> Re-enter <$$font> Mrs. Drewitt , L. C. Mrs. D. <paren> L. -
<font> gaily <$$font> <$$paren> Well , cousin Arthur , and pray what
procures us the honour of this very early call to-day ?
BROUGH-1867-2,7.177

Honi. <paren> R. <$$paren> Oh , Maud , I am in such trouble - such
despair . BROUGH-1867-2,7.178

Mrs. D. Despair , nonsense ! BROUGH-1867-2,7.179

Honi. I knew of no one to whom I could come in my distress but to you .
BROUGH-1867-2,7.180

Mrs. D. But what@ @'s the matter ? BROUGH-1867-2,7.181

Honi. You know how long I have loved my dear Jessie -
BROUGH-1867-2,7.182

you know we have been secretly engaged for some time .
BROUGH-1867-2,7.183

Mrs. D. Hah ! my most verdant budding blossom of a cousin ,
despairing lovers at your age do@ @n't die of broken hearts .
BROUGH-1867-2,7.184

What@ @'s happened ? BROUGH-1867-2,7.185

has the fair Jessie proved unkind ? BROUGH-1867-2,7.186

Honi. Maud , it is no jesting matter . BROUGH-1867-2,7.187

You know my love for Jessie has always been opposed by the old Alderman
Bluck , her father . BROUGH-1867-2,7.188

Mrs. D. And do you suppose that your true love is the first that has
borne out the statement of the immortal bard , by its course running the
opposite of smooth ? BROUGH-1867-2,7.189

No ; Shakespeare knew a thing or two , depend upon it .
BROUGH-1867-2,7.190

Honi. Seeing no hope of the Alderman's relenting , my Jessie and I had
resolved upon a private marriage . BROUGH-1867-2,7.191

In fact , I had induced her to consent to an elopement !
BROUGH-1867-2,7.192

Mrs. D. Then all I can say is , you and your Jessie are two naughty
children that deserve a good sound whipping ! BROUGH-1867-2,7.193

<P_8>

Honi. But hear me out . BROUGH-1867-2,8.195

She was to have met me disguised at the station here .
BROUGH-1867-2,8.196

I , having the marriage license all prepared , was to have accompanied
her to London by the train that has just left . BROUGH-1867-2,8.197

But - Mrs. D. But the stern Alderman , her father , fortunately
discovered your wicked plot in time , BROUGH-1867-2,8.198

and very properly kept the fair Jessie safe at home .
BROUGH-1867-2,8.199

Honi. Not so ! BROUGH-1867-2,8.200

I learned from one of the servants , devoted to our interest , that
Jessie had left home as arranged , and would undoubtedly be at the
station at the time appointed ! BROUGH-1867-2,8.201

Mrs. D. <paren> <font> anxiously <$$font> <$$paren> Well ! well !
BROUGH-1867-2,8.202

Honi. But I - ass - idiot that I was ! I was not there to meet her !
BROUGH-1867-2,8.203

Mrs. D. Arthur , this is more serious than I imagined .
BROUGH-1867-2,8.204

I will not stop now to reproach you for your wickedness in luring a
young girl - a mere child I may say - from her home !
BROUGH-1867-2,8.205

but having done so , how could you possibly have missed meeting her ?
BROUGH-1867-2,8.206

Honi. Hurrying on towards the station , I was overtaken on the road by
a fellow - to all appearances a gentleman - who was driving a splendid
animal , and seeing I was in haste , asked me if he could give me a lift
? BROUGH-1867-2,8.207

Mrs. D. Well , and he drove you to the station ? BROUGH-1867-2,8.208

Honi. He did ; but by a lot of cross roads and bye_lanes I had never
known before . BROUGH-1867-2,8.209

I remonstrated with him from time to time as he took turnings that I
felt sure were in the wrong direction . BROUGH-1867-2,8.210

He replied that it was all right , BROUGH-1867-2,8.211

and at last - BROUGH-1867-2,8.212

Mrs. D. You arrived at the railway ? BROUGH-1867-2,8.213

Honi. I did ! only to find the train had been gone some ten minutes
before , and my Jessie was nowhere to be seen ! BROUGH-1867-2,8.214

Where is she ? BROUGH-1867-2,8.215

Oh , Maud ! where do you think she can be ? BROUGH-1867-2,8.216

Mrs. D. Where ? BROUGH-1867-2,8.217

let me think ! BROUGH-1867-2,8.218

You are sure that she started in good time to catch the train ?
BROUGH-1867-2,8.219

Honi. Quite sure . BROUGH-1867-2,8.220

Mrs. D. Well then , if she@ @'s the girl I take her for , she caught
it ; BROUGH-1867-2,8.221

and is at this moment , I@ @'ll be bound , in London .
BROUGH-1867-2,8.222

Take my advice , Arthur , BROUGH-1867-2,8.223

go up to town at once , BROUGH-1867-2,8.224

I feel assured you@ @'ll find your Jessie in the ladies' waiting room at
Waterloo ; most likely bitterly repenting the rash step she has taken .
BROUGH-1867-2,8.225

There , get away with you at once . BROUGH-1867-2,8.226

This is no time for me to read you a lecture on your folly .
BROUGH-1867-2,8.227

<paren> Honiton <font> crosses to <$$font> L. <$$paren>
BROUGH-1867-2,8.228

Honi. <paren> <font> looking at his watch <$$font> <$$paren> There is a
train I shall just be able to catch . BROUGH-1867-2,8.229

Mrs. D. Then go BROUGH-1867-2,8.230

and catch it , BROUGH-1867-2,8.231

and do@ @n't waste time in talking about it - BROUGH-1867-2,8.232

go ! BROUGH-1867-2,8.233

<P_9>

Honi. Oh , Maud , you have always been my guiding star .
BROUGH-1867-2,9.235

Mrs. D , Well then , the sooner you dethrone me from that position and
accept common sense in my stead the better ; BROUGH-1867-2,9.236

go at once . BROUGH-1867-2,9.237

Jessie must be saved . BROUGH-1867-2,9.238

Mrs. D. Fate , nonsense ! BROUGH-1867-2,9.240

you mean Bradshaw ; BROUGH-1867-2,9.241

Honi. I@ @'m gone . <font> Exit hurriedly <$$font> , L.
BROUGH-1867-2,9.244

Mrs. D. Who could have dreamed of Arthur - the mild quiet Arthur -
committing himself in this way ? And Jessie too , to consent to such a
step ! BROUGH-1867-2,9.245

What will become of the silly young things ? BROUGH-1867-2,9.246

I dare not tell my husband . BROUGH-1867-2,9.247

He is so intimate with the old Alderman , that he would be furious if he
thought I was in any way mixed up in this elopement business .
BROUGH-1867-2,9.248

<font> Enter <$$font> Jenny , L. Jenny . Mr. Goldsworthy , ma'am ,
called to see master . BROUGH-1867-2,9.249

Mrs. D. Eh ? Why your master has just driven up to see him ;
BROUGH-1867-2,9.250

they must have missed each other on the road . BROUGH-1867-2,9.251

Shew the gentleman in here . BROUGH-1867-2,9.252

Jenny . Yes , ma'am . BROUGH-1867-2,9.253

<paren> <font> speaking off <$$font> <$$paren> This way , sir , if you

<font> Enter <$$font> Goldsworthy , L. BROUGH-1867-2,9.255

<font> Exit <$$font> Jenny , L. BROUGH-1867-2,9.256

Goldsworthy . <paren> <font> bowing <$$font> <$$paren> Ten_thousand
pardons , my dear madam , BROUGH-1867-2,9.257

I hope I am not disturbing you . BROUGH-1867-2,9.258

The fact is - Mr. Drewitt and I had a little business this morning .
BROUGH-1867-2,9.259

Mrs. D. My husband told me of your appointment , sir ,
BROUGH-1867-2,9.260

and he has gone to keep it ; BROUGH-1867-2,9.261

I am surprised you have not seen him ; BROUGH-1867-2,9.262

Mr. Drewitt is generally so very punctual in business .
BROUGH-1867-2,9.263

Golds. My fault , my dear madam , entirely - not his .
BROUGH-1867-2,9.264

I have no doubt he knocked at the door as the clock pointed to the
minute agreed upon ; BROUGH-1867-2,9.265

but the fact is , I felt so restless this morning that I could not wait
for him at home , so I jumped into my dog-cart , hoping to get here
before he started . BROUGH-1867-2,9.266

Mrs. D. I@ @'m sorry you should have missed him , sir .
BROUGH-1867-2,9.267

Golds. All my fault . BROUGH-1867-2,9.268

I should have named an earlier hour for our meeting - that is , if Mr.
Drewitt could have come to me - or should have arranged for me to come
to him . BROUGH-1867-2,9.269

Mrs. D. You are an early riser , then , Mr. Goldsworthy ?
BROUGH-1867-2,9.270

Golds. Not as a rule . BROUGH-1867-2,9.271

I may say quite the contrary : BROUGH-1867-2,9.272

indeed , when I lived in Piccadilly I was about as much the reverse of
an early riser as you could well imagine ; BROUGH-1867-2,9.273

but since I have come to live out of town - <paren> Well , it@ @'s true
I have@ @n't had much experience of it yet ; BROUGH-1867-2,9.274

I have only tried one night . <$$paren> BROUGH-1867-2,9.275

Mrs. D. And do you like what you have seen of country life ?
BROUGH-1867-2,9.276

<P_10>

Golds. Like it ! BROUGH-1867-2,10.278

My dear madam , rural felicity is a mistake ! BROUGH-1867-2,10.279

Country quietude is a mockery and a delusion ! BROUGH-1867-2,10.280

When I lived in Piccadilly I could sleep - BROUGH-1867-2,10.281

in fact did sleep ! BROUGH-1867-2,10.282

Mrs. D. And with hansom_cabs rattling along the streets all night ?
BROUGH-1867-2,10.283

Golds. Oh ! cabs are nothing ! BROUGH-1867-2,10.284

One gets used to cabs . BROUGH-1867-2,10.285

But here - BROUGH-1867-2,10.286

Mrs. D. Here you were quiet , I suppose , at any rate ?
BROUGH-1867-2,10.287

Golds. Quiet , my dear madam ! BROUGH-1867-2,10.288

I scarcely got a wink of sleep all night ; BROUGH-1867-2,10.289

of all the awful rows I ever heard kicked up , to hinder one from
sleeping ! BROUGH-1867-2,10.290

Mrs. D. You surprise me , sir ; BROUGH-1867-2,10.291

what noise ? BROUGH-1867-2,10.292

Golds. The birds ! BROUGH-1867-2,10.293

Mrs. D. The birds ? BROUGH-1867-2,10.294

Golds. The birds , madam ! BROUGH-1867-2,10.295

I do@ @n't know what time in the morning , or rather in the middle of
the night , they are supposed to begin ; BROUGH-1867-2,10.296

but it was twitter , twitter , chirrup , chirrup , or whatever it is the
blessed things are supposed to sing or say , until sleep was totally out
of the question . BROUGH-1867-2,10.297

A London organ-grinder is a fool to them , I assure you !
BROUGH-1867-2,10.298

Mrs. D. So you were compelled , I suppose , in self-defence , to get
up ? BROUGH-1867-2,10.299

Golds. I was , BROUGH-1867-2,10.300

I am ashamed to say at what o'clock . BROUGH-1867-2,10.301

I was the only one stirring . BROUGH-1867-2,10.302

How to occupy myself till any civilized breakfast time was the question
. BROUGH-1867-2,10.303

I tried a country walk , BROUGH-1867-2,10.304

but you@ @'d be surprised to find how short a time that occupies .
BROUGH-1867-2,10.305

I attempted to do a bit of gardening : BROUGH-1867-2,10.306

in fact I did pull up some dozen weeds or so , <paren> that is , I
suppose they were weeds , <$$paren> BROUGH-1867-2,10.307

but you@ @'ve no idea how gardening makes one's back ache .
BROUGH-1867-2,10.308

Well , then , I thought I@ @'d read ; BROUGH-1867-2,10.309

but it was no use . BROUGH-1867-2,10.310

The hours would@ @n't pass . BROUGH-1867-2,10.311

At last , as soon as it was decent , I rang up my man ,
BROUGH-1867-2,10.312

had out my dog-cart , BROUGH-1867-2,10.313

and started off to see Mr. Drewitt . BROUGH-1867-2,10.314

Mrs. D. And yet you were too late to meet him after all .
BROUGH-1867-2,10.315

Golds. Quite an accident . BROUGH-1867-2,10.316

I was in excellent time ; BROUGH-1867-2,10.317

but a little adventure on the road - BROUGH-1867-2,10.318

Mrs. D. An adventure ? BROUGH-1867-2,10.319

Golds. Precisely . BROUGH-1867-2,10.320

You must know , madam , if I have a failing - BROUGH-1867-2,10.321

No , I do@ @n't mean that , of course ; BROUGH-1867-2,10.322

everybody has his failings ; BROUGH-1867-2,10.323

but my chief weakness is a constant desire to assist a fellow-creature ,
if I see a chance . BROUGH-1867-2,10.324

Mrs. D. An amiable one at any rate . BROUGH-1867-2,10.325

Golds. Upon the way here , I met a young man tearing along the road on
foot towards the station . BROUGH-1867-2,10.326

Mrs. D. <paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> It was Arthur .
BROUGH-1867-2,10.327

Golds. I offered to give him a lift , as I had plenty of time -
BROUGH-1867-2,10.328

just my stupid weakness , you know ! BROUGH-1867-2,10.329

- well , in a few words , I missed the road , BROUGH-1867-2,10.330

and as a consequence he missed the train ; BROUGH-1867-2,10.331

<P_11>

and - would you believe it ? - instead of thanking me for my good
intentions , he abused me like a pickpocket . BROUGH-1867-2,11.333

But it@ @'s just my luck ; BROUGH-1867-2,11.334

I never try to assist my fellow creatures , BROUGH-1867-2,11.335

but I@ @'m sure to put my foot in it . BROUGH-1867-2,11.336

Jenny . Well , sir , my place is good enough , as places go ;
BROUGH-1867-2,11.354

but service is service , after all , however good your place may be .
BROUGH-1867-2,11.355

Golds. True . BROUGH-1867-2,11.356

I alluded to the house and grounds , though ; not to your own situation
. BROUGH-1867-2,11.357

Jenny . I did hope I should soon have done with it ,
BROUGH-1867-2,11.358

but circumstances , sir - BROUGH-1867-2,11.359

Golds. What do you mean ? BROUGH-1867-2,11.360

What circumstances ? BROUGH-1867-2,11.361

Jenny . Pecuniary ones , sir ; those circumstances over which we have
no control . BROUGH-1867-2,11.362

Golds. <paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> Wants money !

only I happened to hear of something that would suit us beautifully
to-day . BROUGH-1867-2,11.370

But it does@ @n't matter . BROUGH-1867-2,11.371

Perhaps another chance will turn up bye_and_bye . BROUGH-1867-2,11.372

Golds. Certainly - by all means ! BROUGH-1867-2,11.373

But , as a matter of curiosity , how much would enable you to avail
yourself of what you heard of to-day , and settle you in life -
BROUGH-1867-2,11.374

<P_12>

Jenny . Yes , sir , that@ @'s just what we do mean ;

to lend to folks like us ? BROUGH-1867-2,12.383

Golds. Certainly not . BROUGH-1867-2,12.384

People are not Pickford's vans , to carry all that weight of metal ;

Jessie . Do@ @n't joke with me , please ; BROUGH-1867-2,14.482

Mrs. D. On the contrary , sir , I was anxiously wishing to see you .
BROUGH-1867-2,15.576

Golds. Madam , you charm me . BROUGH-1867-2,15.577

Mrs. D. I hardly dare ask it , BROUGH-1867-2,15.578

Mrs. Drewitt , I am sorry that an important engagement compels me to

He dare not go by train , BROUGH-1867-2,16.596

Golds. Imprudently ! BROUGH-1867-2,16.634

BROUGH-1867-2,23.962

Golds. Here , hold on ! BROUGH-1867-2,23.963

what the deuce ? BROUGH-1867-2,23.964

Oh , no , absurd - impossible - a woman ? BROUGH-1867-2,23.965

Jessie . Did you not know it ? BROUGH-1867-2,23.966

Golds. Why , how on earth could I imagine - BROUGH-1867-2,23.967

Jessie . I thought that Mrs. Drewitt had told you all - that you were
in our confidence . BROUGH-1867-2,23.968

Golds. I , Mrs. Drewitt ! BROUGH-1867-2,23.969

Do@ @n't talk such infern - I mean such infatuated nonsense .
BROUGH-1867-2,23.970

Jessie . What must you have thought of me ? BROUGH-1867-2,23.971

Golds. Well , many things , during the few hours I have known you ;
BROUGH-1867-2,23.972

but never mind my thoughts . BROUGH-1867-2,23.973

Jessie . Directly I arrived here , I wrote to Arthur , telling him
where to find me . BROUGH-1867-2,23.974

Golds. <paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> And who the devil@ @'s
Arthur ? BROUGH-1867-2,23.975

Jessie . But he can scarcely have received my letter yet , even were he
at home . BROUGH-1867-2,23.976

Left in that room so many hours to my own thoughts , I at last resolved
to risk all - disgrace - my father's anger - everything -
BROUGH-1867-2,23.977

so I have changed my dress in order to go back . BROUGH-1867-2,23.978

Golds. I@ @'ve not the least idea what you@ @'re talking about .
BROUGH-1867-2,23.979

But if you mean relieving me from the somewhat awkward position I find
myself in , I@ @'m sorry that you did not come to that determination at
first , instead of at last . BROUGH-1867-2,23.980

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> If ever again I try to do a good
turn for my fellow creatures as long as I live - BROUGH-1867-2,23.981

Jessie . You do not know the cause then of my disguise this morning ?
BROUGH-1867-2,23.982

Golds. Have@ @n't the faintest notion . BROUGH-1867-2,23.983

Jessie . Then 't@ @is but right you should , although I blush to tell
it . BROUGH-1867-2,23.984

Golds. Do@ @n't blush on my account , I beg - BROUGH-1867-2,23.985

Golds. Do@ @n't try then , pray . BROUGH-1867-2,24.993

I would@ @n't embarrass you for the world ; BROUGH-1867-2,24.994

but if I can in any way assist you - BROUGH-1867-2,24.995

Jessie . Oh , sir , you are too kind . BROUGH-1867-2,24.996

BROUGH-1867-2,24.997

she@ @'s right . BROUGH-1867-2,24.998

Why should I interest myself now in this girl - a perfect stranger ?
BROUGH-1867-2,24.999

But yet she@ @'s very nice ! BROUGH-1867-2,24.1000

Jessie . You were saying , sir - BROUGH-1867-2,24.1001

Golds. Was I ? BROUGH-1867-2,24.1002

If I could assist you - of course , as a matter of the purest friendship
- <paren> <font> draws his chair nearer <$$font> <$$paren> If , for
instance , I could take you anywhere else - I mean away from here , you

Eh - why it@ @'s the fellow I gave a lift to this morning to the
Richmond station ! BROUGH-1867-2,24.1011

Honi. No , Jessie , I have had no letter , BROUGH-1867-2,24.1012

but have traced you by other means . BROUGH-1867-2,24.1013

All day have I been seeking you , and reproaching myself with having
missed our appointment , BROUGH-1867-2,24.1014

but <font> now <$$font> I see why you could not wait for me .
BROUGH-1867-2,24.1015

Jessie . Arthur , what do you mean ? BROUGH-1867-2,24.1016

Golds. My angry young friend , if you allude to your finding this young
lady in my chambers , that can be soon explained .
BROUGH-1867-2,24.1017

Honi. I shall demand an explanation of <font> you <$$font> , sir , at a
more fitting time ! BROUGH-1867-2,24.1018

I can quite understand now why you caused me to miss that train this
morning . BROUGH-1867-2,24.1019

Golds. <paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> Well , I@ @'ll be hanged
- BROUGH-1867-2,24.1020

this comes of trying to help one's fellow creatures !
BROUGH-1867-2,24.1021

If ever I do any one a good turn again - BROUGH-1867-2,24.1022

Honi. I see it all ! BROUGH-1867-2,24.1023

<paren> <font> to <$$font> Jessie <$$paren> You resigned me for a more
<font> wealthy <$$font> lover ; while you , sir , to prevent our meeting
, waylaid me upon the road , and kept me from my appointment .
BROUGH-1867-2,24.1024

Golds. Waylaid you , sir ? BROUGH-1867-2,24.1025

Oh , here , I@ @'ve had enough of this - BROUGH-1867-2,24.1026

I wash my hands of the affair . BROUGH-1867-2,24.1027

Take the girl away ! BROUGH-1867-2,24.1028

Honi. What ! I take her , after her running off with you ?
BROUGH-1867-2,24.1029

I discard her ! BROUGH-1867-2,24.1030

Jessie . No , no ! Oh , Arthur , do believe me .
BROUGH-1867-2,24.1031

Honi. I believe my own eyes in preference . BROUGH-1867-2,24.1032

Why do I find you here ? BROUGH-1867-2,24.1033

Golds. Exactly - just what I say . BROUGH-1867-2,24.1034

Why , indeed ? BROUGH-1867-2,24.1035

I@ @'m sure I do@ @n't want her . BROUGH-1867-2,24.1036

Take her away , I tell you , BROUGH-1867-2,24.1037

and if ever you catch me again - meddling with matters of this kind -
BROUGH-1867-2,24.1038

Honi. How ? You have not even the manliness to abide the consequences
of your vile action . BROUGH-1867-2,24.1039

Golds. Do@ @n't bother . BROUGH-1867-2,24.1040

Hark ! I hear footsteps ! BROUGH-1867-2,24.1041

Jessie . Oh , if it should be some one in pursuit of me !
BROUGH-1867-2,25.1043

Golds. I think it highly probable . BROUGH-1867-2,25.1044

Jessie . Oh , save me . BROUGH-1867-2,25.1045

sir - let me conceal myself . BROUGH-1867-2,25.1046

Golds. No , I@ @'ll be hanged if I do ! BROUGH-1867-2,25.1047
