<P_12,1J>

Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany , where
Lazarus was , whom Jesus raised from the dead . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.4

So they made him a supper there : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.5

and Martha served ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.6

but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.7

Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of spikenard , very precious ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.8

and anointed the feet of Jesus , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.9

and wiped his feet with her hair : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.10

and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.11

But Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples , which should betray him ,
saith , Why was not this ointment sold for three_hundred pence , and
given to the poor ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.12

Now this he said , not because he cared for the poor ; but because he
was a thief , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.13

and having the bag took away what was put therein .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.14

Jesus therefore said , Suffer her to keep it against the day of my
burying . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.15

For the poor ye have always with you ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.16

but me ye have not always . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.17

The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.18

and they came , not for Jesus' sake only , but that they might see
Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.19

But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to
death ; because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and
believed on Jesus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.20

On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast , when they
heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem , took the branches of the palm
trees , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.21

and went forth to meet him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.22

and cried out , Hosanna : Blessed <font> is <$$font> he that cometh in
the name of the Lord , even the King of Israel .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.23

And Jesus , having found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written ,
Fear not , daughter of Zion : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.24

behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass's colt .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.25

These things understood not his disciples at the first :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.26

but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things
were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.27

The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of
the tomb , and raised him from the dead , bare witness ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.28

For this cause also the multitude went ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.29

and met him , for that they heard that he had done this sign .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.30

The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , Behold how ye prevail
nothing : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.31

lo , the world is gone after him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1J.32

<P_12,20J> Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to
worship at the feast : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.33

these therefore came to Philip , which was of Bethsaida of Galilee ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.34

and asked him , saying , Sir , we would see Jesus .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.35

Philip cometh ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.36

and telleth Andrew : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.37

Andrew cometh , and Philip , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.38

and they tell Jesus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.39

And Jesus answereth them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of
man should be glorified . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.40

Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a grain of wheat fall into the
earth and die , it abideth by itself alone ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.41

but if it die , it beareth much fruit . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.42

He that loveth his life loseth it ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.43

and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life
eternal . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.44

If any man serve me , let him follow me ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.45

and where I am , there shall also my servant be :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.46

if any man serve me , him will the Father honour .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.47

Now is my soul troubled ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.48

and what shall I say ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.49

Father , save me from this hour , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.50

But for this cause came I unto this hour . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.51

Father , glorify thy name . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.52

There came therefore a voice out of heaven , <font> saying , <$$font> I
have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.53

The multitude therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it
had thundered : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.54

others said , An angel hath spoken to him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.55

Jesus answered ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.56

and said , This voice hath not come for my sake , but for your sakes .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.57

Now is the judgement of this world : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.58

now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.59

And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto myself
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.60

But this he said , signifying by what manner of death he should die .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.61

The multitude therefore answered him , We have heard out of the law that
the Christ abideth for ever : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.62

and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.63

who is this Son of man ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.64

Jesus therefore said unto them , Yet a little while is the light among
you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.65

Walk while ye have the light , that darkness overtake you not :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.66

and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.67

While ye have the light , believe on the light , that ye may become sons
of light . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.68

These things spake Jesus , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.69

and he departed ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.70

and hid himself from them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.71

But though he had done so many signs before them , yet they believed not
on him : that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be , fulfilled ,
which he spake , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.72

Lord , who hath believed our report ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.73

And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20J.74

For this cause they could not believe , for that Isaiah said again ,
<P_12,40J> He hath blinded their eyes , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.75

and he hardened their heart ; Lest they should see with their eyes , and
perceive with their heart , And should turn , And I should heal them .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.76

These things said Isaiah , because he saw his glory ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.77

and he spake of him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.78

Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.79

but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <font> it , <$$font>
lest they should be put out of the synagogue : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.80

for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.81

And Jesus cried ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.82

and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him
that sent me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.83

And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.84

I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me may
not abide in the darkness . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.85

And if any man hear my sayings , and keep them not , I judge him not :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.86

for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.87

He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my sayings , hath one that
judgeth him : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.88

the word that I spake , the same shall judge him in the last day .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.89

For I spake not from myself ; but the Father which sent me ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.90

he hath given me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should
speak . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.91

And I know that his commandment is life eternal :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.92

the things therefore which I speak , even as the Father hath said unto
me , so I speak . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,40J.93

<P_13,1J> Now before the feast of the passover , Jesus knowing that his
hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father ,
having loved his own which were in the world , he loved them unto the
end . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.94

And during supper , the devil having already put into the heart of Judas
Iscariot , Simon's <font> son , <$$font> to betray him , <font> Jesus ,
<$$font> knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands ,
and that he came forth from God , and goeth unto God , riseth from
supper , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.95

and layeth aside his garments ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.96

and he took a towel , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.97

and girded himself . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.98

Then he poureth water into the bason , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.99

and began to wash the disciples feet , and to wipe them with the towel
wherewith he was girded . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.100

So he cometh to Simon Peter . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.101

He saith unto him , Lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.102

Jesus answered ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.103

and said unto him , What I do thou knowest not now ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.104

but thou shalt understand hereafter . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.105

Peter saith unto him , Thou shalt never wash my feet .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.106

Jesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.107

Simon Peter saith unto him , Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands
and my head . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.108

Jesus saith to him , He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet
, ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.109

but is clean every whit : ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.110

and ye are clean , but not all . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.111

For he knew him that should betray him ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.112

therefore said he , Ye are not all clean . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.113

So when he had washed their feet , and taken his garments , and sat down
again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.114

Ye call me , Master , and , Lord : ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.115

and ye say well ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.116

for so I am . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.117

If I then , the Lord and the Master , have washed your feet , ye also
ought to wash one another's feet . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.118

For I have given you an example , that ye also should do as I have done
to you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1J.119

<P_13,20J>

Verily , verily , I say unto you , A servant is not greater than his
lord ; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.121

If ye know these things , blessed are ye if ye do them .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.122

I speak not of you all ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.123

I know whom I have chosen ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.124

but that the scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth my bread lifted
up his heel against me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.125

From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass , that , when it is
come to pass , ye may believe that I am <font> he . <$$font>
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.126

Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send
receiveth me ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.127

and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.128

When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in the spirit ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.129

and testified , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.130

and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall
betray me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.131

The disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.132

There was at the table reclining in Jesus' bosom one of his disciples ,
whom Jesus loved . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.133

Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.134

and saith unto him , Tell <font> us <$$font> who it is of whom he
speaketh . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.135

He leaning back , as he was , on Jesus' breast saith unto him , Lord ,
who is it ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.136

Jesus therefore answereth , He it is , for whom I shall dip the sop ,
and give it him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.137

So when he had dipped the sop , he taketh and giveth it to Judas ,
<font> the son <$$font> of Simon Iscariot . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.138

And after the sop , then entered : Satan into him .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.139

Jesus therefore saith unto him , That thou doest , do quickly .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.140

Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.141

For some thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus said unto him
, Buy what things we have need of for the feast ; or , that he should
give something to the poor . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.142

He then having received the sop went out straightway :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.143

and it was night . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.144

When therefore he was gone out , Jesus saith , Now is the Son of man
glorified , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.145

and God is glorified in him ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.146

and God shall glorify him in himself , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.147

and straightway shall he glorify him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.148

Little children , yet a little while I am with you .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.149

Ye shall seek me : ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.150

and as I said unto the Jews , Whither I go , ye can@ @not come ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.151

so now I say unto you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.152

A new commandment I give unto you , that ye love one another ; even as I
have loved you , that ye also love one another .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.153

By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love
one to another . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.154

Simon Peter saith unto him , Lord , whither goest thou ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.155

Jesus answered , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.156

but thou shalt follow afterwards . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.157

Peter saith unto him , Lord , why can@ @not I follow thee even now ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.158

I will lay down my life for thee . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.159

Jesus answereth , Wilt thou lay down thy life for me ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.160

Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou
hast denied me thrice . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20J.161

<P_14,1J> Let not your heart be troubled : ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.162

ye believe in God , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.163

believe also in me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.164

In my Father's house are many mansions ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.165

if it were not so , I would have told you ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.166

for I go to prepare a place for you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.167

And if I go and prepare a place for you , I come again ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.168

and will receive you unto myself ; that where I am , <font> there
<$$font> ye may be also . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.169

And whither I go , ye know the way . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.170

Thomas saith unto him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.171

how know we the way ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.172

Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , and the truth , and the life :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.173

no one cometh unto the Father , but by me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.174

If ye had known me , ye would have known my Father also ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.175

from henceforth ye know him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.176

and have seen him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.177

Philip saith unto him , Lord , shew us the Father ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.178

and it sufficeth us . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.179

Jesus saith unto him , Have I been so long time with you ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.180

and dost thou not know me , Philip ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.181

he that hath seen me hath seen the Father ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.182

how sayest thou , Shew us the Father ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.183

Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.184

the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.185

but the Father abiding in me doeth his works . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.186

Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.187

or else believe me for the very works' sake . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.188

Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works
that I do shall he do also ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.189

and greater <font> works <$$font> than these shall he do ; because I go
unto the Father . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.190

And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the
Father may be glorified in the Son . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.191

If ye shall ask me any thing in my name , that will I do .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.192

If ye love me , ye will keep my commandments . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.193

And I will pray the Father , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.194

and he shall give you another Comforter , that he may be with you for
ever , <font> even <$$font> the Spirit of truth : whom the world can@
@not receive ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.195

for it beholdeth him not , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.196

neither knoweth him : ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.197

ye know him ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.198

for he abideth with you , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.199

and shall be in you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.200

I will not leave you desolate : ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.201

I come unto you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.202

Yet a little while , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.203

and the world beholdeth me no more ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.204

but ye behold me : ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.205

because I live , ye shall live also . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1J.206

<P_14,20J>

In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I
in you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.208

He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth
me : ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.209

and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.210

and I will love him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.211

and will manifest myself unto him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.212

Judas <paren> not Iscariot <$$paren> saith unto him , Lord , what is
come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the
world ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.213

Jesus answered ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.214

and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my word :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.215

and my Father will love him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.216

and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.217

He that loveth me not keepeth not my words : ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.218

and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father's who sent me .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.219

These things have I spoken unto you , while <font> yet <$$font> abiding
with you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.220

But the Comforter , <font> even <$$font> the Holy Spirit , whom the
Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring
to your remembrance all that I said unto you .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.221

Peace I leave with you ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.222

my peace I give unto you : ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.223

not as the world giveth , give I unto you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.224

Let not your heart be troubled , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.225

neither let it be fearful . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.226

Ye heard how I said to you , I go away , and I come unto you .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.227

If ye loved me , ye would have rejoiced , because I go unto the Father :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.228

for the Father is greater than I . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.229

And now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come
to pass , ye may believe . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.230

I will no more speak much with you , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.231

for the prince of the world cometh : ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.232

and he hath nothing in me ; but that the world may know that I love the
Father , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.233

and as the Father gave me commandment , even so I do .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.234

Arise , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.235

let us go hence . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20J.236

<P_15,1J> I am the true vine , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.237

and my Father is the husband man . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.238

Every branch in me that beareth not fruit , he taketh it away :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.239

and every <font> branch <$$font> that beareth fruit , he cleanseth it ,
that it may bear more fruit . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.240

Already ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.241

Abide in me , and I in you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.242

As the branch can@ @not bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the
vine ; so neither can ye , except ye abide in me .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.243

I am the vine , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.244

ye are the branches : ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.245

He that abideth in me , and I in him , the same beareth much fruit :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.246

for apart from me ye can do nothing . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.247

If a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.248

and is withered ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.249

and they gather them , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.250

and cast them into the fire , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.251

and they are burned . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.252

If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ask whatsoever ye will ,
and it shall be done unto you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.253

Herein is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.254

and <font> so <$$font> shall ye be my disciples .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.255

Even as the Father hath loved me , I also have loved you :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.256

abide ye in my love . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.257

If ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have
kept my Father's commandments , and abide in his love .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.258

These things have I spoken unto you , that my joy may be in you , and
<font> that <$$font> your joy may be fulfilled .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.259

This is my commandment , that ye love one another , even as I have loved
you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.260

Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for
his friends . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.261

Ye are my friends , if ye do the things which I command you .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.262

No longer do I call you servants ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.263

for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.264

but I have called you friends ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.265

for all things that I heard from my Father I have made known unto you .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.266

Ye did not choose me , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.267

but I chose you , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.268

and appointed you , that ye should go and bear fruit , and <font> that
<$$font> your fruit should abide : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
Father in my name , he may give it you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.269

These things I command you , that ye may love one another .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.270

If the world hateth you , ye know that it hath hated me before <font> it
hated <$$font> you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.271

If ye were of the world , the world would love its own :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.272

but because ye are not of the world , but I chose you out of the world ,
therefore the world hateth you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1J.273

<P_15,20J> Remember the word that I said unto you ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.274

A servant is not greater than his lord . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.275

If they persecuted me , they will also persecute you ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.276

if they kept my word , they will keep yours also .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.277

But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake , because
they know not him that sent me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.278

If I had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.279

but now they have no excuse for their sin . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.280

He that hateth me hateth my Father also . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.281

If I had not done among them the works which none other did , they had
not had sin ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.282

but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.283

But <font> this cometh to pass , <$$font> that the word may be fulfilled
that is written in their law , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.284

They hated me without a cause . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.285

But when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the
Father , <font> even <$$font> the Spirit of truth , which proceedeth
from the Father , he shall bear witness of me :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.286

and ye also bear witness , because ye have been with me from the
beginning . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20J.287

<P_16,1J> These things have I spoken unto you , that ye should not be
made to stumble . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.288

They shall put you out of the synagogues : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.289

yea , the hour cometh , that whosoever killeth you shall think that he
offereth service unto God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.290

And these things will they do , because they have not known the Father ,
nor me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.291

But these things have I spoken unto you , that when their hour is come ,
ye may remember them , how that I told you , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.292

And these things I said not unto you from the beginning , because I was
with you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.293

But now I go unto him that sent me ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.294

and none of you asketh me , Whither goest thou ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.295

But because I have spoken these things unto you , sorrow hath filled
your heart . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.296

Nevertheless I tell you the truth ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.297

It is expedient for you that I go away : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.298

for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.299

but if I go , will send him unto you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.300

And he , when he is come , will convict the world in respect of sin ,
and of righteousness , and of judgement : of sin , because they believe
not on me ; of righteousness , because I go to the Father , and ye
behold me no more ; of judgement , because the prince of this world hath
been judged . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.301

I have yet many things to say unto you , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.302

but ye can@ @not bear them now . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.303

Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he shall guide you
into all the truth : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.304

for he shall not speak from himself ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.305

but what things soever he shall hear , <font> these <$$font> shall he
speak : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.306

and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.307

He shall glorify me : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.308

for he shall take of mine , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.309

and shall declare <font> it <$$font> unto you .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.310

All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.311

therefore said I , that he taketh of mine , and shall declare <font> it
<$$font> unto you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.312

A little while , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.313

and ye behold me no more ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.314

and again a little while , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.315

and ye shall see me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.316

<font> Some <$$font> of his disciples therefore said one to another ,
What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye behold me
not ; and again a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I
go to the Father ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.317

They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.318

We know not what he saith . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.319

Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.320

and he said unto them , Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this ,
that I said , A little while , and ye behold me not , and again a little
while , and ye shall see me ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1J.321

<P_16,20J> Verily , verily , I say unto you , that ye shall weep and
lament , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.322

but the world shall rejoice : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.323

ye shall be sorrowful , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.324

but your sorrow shall be turned into joy . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.325

A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.326

but when she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the
anguish , for the joy that a man is born into the world .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.327

And ye therefore now have sorrow : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.328

but I will see you again , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.329

and your heart shall rejoice , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.330

and your joy no one taketh away from you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.331

And in that day ye shall ask me nothing , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.332

Verily , verily , I say unto you , If ye shall ask anything of the
Father , he will give it you in my name . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.333

Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.334

ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be fulfilled .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.335

These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.336

the hour cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but
shall tell you plainly of the Father . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.337

In that day ye shall ask in my name : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.338

and I say not unto you , that I will pray the Father for you ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.339

for the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have
believed that I came forth from the Father . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.340

I came out from the Father , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.341

and am come into the world ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.342

again , I leave the world , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.343

and go unto the Father . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.344

His disciples say , Lo , now speakest thou plainly ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.345

and speakest no proverb . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.346

Now know we that thou knowest all things , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.347

and needest not that any man should ask thee : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.348

by this we believe that thou earnest forth from God .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.349

Jesus answered them , Do ye now believe ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.350

Behold , the hour cometh , yea , is come , that ye shall be scattered ,
every man to his own , and shall leave me alone :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.351

and <font> yet <$$font> I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.352

These things have I spoken unto you , that in me ye may have peace .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.353

In the world ye have tribulation ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.354

but be of good cheer ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.355

I have overcome the world . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20J.356

<P_17,1J> These things spake Jesus ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.357

and lifting up his eyes to heaven , he said , Father , the hour is come
; ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.358

glorify thy Son , that the Son may glorify thee : even as thou gavest
him authority over all flesh , that whatsoever thou hast given him , to
them he should give eternal life . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.359

And this is life eternal , that they should know thee the only true God
, and him whom thou didst send , <font> even <$$font> Jesus Christ .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.360

I glorified thee on the earth , having accomplished the work which thou
hast given me to do . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.361

And now , O Father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory
which I had with thee before the world was . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.362

I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world
: ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.363

thine they were , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.364

and thou gavest them to me ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.365

and they have kept thy word . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.366

Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from
thee : ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.367

for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.368

and they received <font> them , <$$font> ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.369

and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.370

and they believed that thou didst send me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.371

I pray for them : ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.372

I pray not for the world , but for those whom thou hast given me ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.373

for they are thine ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.374

and all things that are mine are thine , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.375

and thine are mine : ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.376

and I am glorified in them , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.377

And I am no more in the world , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.378

and these are in the world , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.379

and I come to thee . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.380

Holy Father , keep them in thy name which thou hast given me , that they
may be one , even as we <font> are . <$$font> ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.381

While I was with them , I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me
: ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.382

and I guarded them , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.383

and not one of them perished , but the son of perdition ; that the
scripture might be fulfilled . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.384

But now I come to thee ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.385

and these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy
fulfilled in themselves . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.386

I have given them thy word ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.387

and the world hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I
am not of the world . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.388

I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world , but that thou
shouldest keep them from the evil <font> one . <$$font>
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.389

They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.390

Sanctify them in the truth : ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.391

thy word is truth . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.392

As thou didst send me into the world , even so sent I them into the
world . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.393

And for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they themselves also may be
sanctified in truth . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1J.394

<P_17,20J> Neither for these only do I pray , but for them also that
believe on me through their word ; that they may all be one ; even as
thou , Father , <font> art <$$font> in me , and I in thee , that they
also may be in us : that the world may believe that thou didst send me .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20J.395

And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them ; that
they may be one , even as we <font> are <$$font> one ; I in them , and
thou in me , that they may be perfected into one ; that the world may
know that thou didst send me , and lovedst them , even as thou lovedst
me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20J.396

Father , that which thou hast given me , I will that , where I am , they
also may be with me ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast
given me ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20J.397

for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20J.398

O righteous Father , the world knew thee not , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20J.399

but I knew thee ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20J.400

and these knew that thou didst send me ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20J.401

and I made known unto them thy name , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20J.402

and will make it known ; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be
in them , and I in them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20J.403

<P_18,1J> When Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his
disciples over the brook Kidron , where was a garden , into the which he
entered , himself and his disciples . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.404

Now Judas also , which betrayed him , knew the place :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.405

for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.406

Judas then , having received the band <font> of soldiers , <$$font> and
officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees , cometh thither with
lanterns and torches and weapons . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.407

Jesus therefore , knowing all the things that were coming upon him ,
went forth , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.408

and saith unto them , Whom seek ye ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.409

They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.410

Jesus saith unto them , I am <font> he . <$$font>
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.411

And Judas also , which betrayed him , was standing with them .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.412

When therefore he said unto them , I am <font> he <$$font> , they went
backward , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.413

and fell to the ground . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.414

Again therefore he asked them , Whom seek ye ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.415

And they said , Jesus of Nazareth . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.416

Jesus answered , I told you that I am <font> he : <$$font>
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.417

if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way : that the word might
be fulfilled which he spake , Of those whom thou hast given me I lost
not one . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.418

Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.419

and struck the high priest's servant , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.420

and cut off his right ear . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.421

Now the servant's name was Malchus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.422

Jesus therefore said unto Peter , Put up the sword into the sheath :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.423

the cup which the Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.424

So the band and the chief captain , and the officers of the Jews ,
seized Jesus ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.425

and bound him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.426

and led him to Annas first ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.427

for he was father in law to Caiaphas , which was high priest that year .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.428

Now Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the Jews , that it was
expedient that one man should die for the people .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.429

And Simon Peter followed Jesus , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.430

and <font> so did <$$font> another disciple . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.431

Now that disciple was known unto the high priest ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.432

and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.433

but Peter was standing at the door without . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.434

So the other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , went out
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.435

and spake unto her that kept the door , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.436

and brought in Peter . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.437

The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter , Art thou also
<font> one <$$font> of this man's disciples ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.438

He saith , I am not . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.439

Now the servants and the officers were standing <font> there , <$$font>
having made a fire of coals ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.440

for it was cold ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.441

and they were warming themselves : ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.442

and Peter also was with them , standing and warming himself .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.443

The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his
teaching . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,1J.444

<P_18,20J> Jesus answered him , I have spoken openly to the world ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.445

I ever taught in synagogues , and in the temple , where all the Jews
come together ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.446

and in secret spake I nothing . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.447

Why askest thou me ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.448

ask them that have heard <font> me , <$$font> what I spake unto them ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.449

behold , these know the things which I said . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.450

And when he had said this , one of the officers standing by struck Jesus
with his hand , saying , Answerest thou the high priest so ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.451

Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.452

but if well , why smitest thou me ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.453

Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.454

Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.455

They said therefore unto him , Art thou also <font> one <$$font> of his
disciples ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.456

He denied , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.457

and said , I am not . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.458

One of the servants of the high priest , being a kinsman of him whose
ear Peter cut off , saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.459

Peter therefore denied again : ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.460

and straightway the cock crew . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.461

They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the palace :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.462

and it was early ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.463

and they themselves entered not into the palace , that they might not be
defiled , but might eat the passover . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.464

Pilate therefore went out unto them , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.465

and saith , What accusation bring ye against this man ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.466

They answered ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.467

and said unto him , If this man were not an evil-doer , we should not
have delivered him up unto thee . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.468

Pilate therefore said unto them , Take him yourselves ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.469

and judge him according to your law . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.470

The Jews said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death
: that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake ,
signifying by what manner of death he should die .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.471

Pilate therefore entered again into the palace ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.472

and called Jesus , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.473

and said unto him , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.474

Jesus answered , Sayest thou this of thyself , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.475

or did others tell it thee concerning me ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.476

Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.477

Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.478

what hast thou done ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.479

Jesus answered , My kingdom is not of this world :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.480

if my kingdom were of this world , then would my Servants fight , that I
should not be delivered to the Jews : ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.481

but now is my kingdom not from hence . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.482

Pilate therefore said unto him , Art thou a king then ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.483

Jesus answered , Thou sayest that I am a king .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.484

To this end have I been born , ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.485

and to this end am I come into the world , that I should bear witness
unto the truth . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.486

Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.487

Pilate saith unto him , What is truth ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.488

And when he had said this , he went out again unto the Jews ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.489

and saith unto them , I find no crime in him .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.490

But ye have a custom , that I should release unto you one at the
passover ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.491

will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,20J.492

<P_18,40J> They cried out therefore again , saying , Not this man , but
Barabbas . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,40J.493

Now Barabbas was a robber . ERV-NEW-1881-2,18,40J.494

<P_19,1J>

Then Pilate therefore took Jesus , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.496

and scourged him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.497

And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.498

and put it on his head , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.499

and arrayed him in a purple garment ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.500

and they came unto him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.501

and said , Hail , King of the Jews ! ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.502

and they struck him with their hands . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.503

And Pilate went out again , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.504

and saith unto them , Behold , I bring him out to you , that ye may know
that I find no crime in him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.505

Jesus therefore came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple
garment . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.506

And <font> Pilate <$$font> saith unto them , Behold , the man !
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.507

When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him , they cried
out , saying , Crucify <font> him , <$$font> ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.508

crucify <font> him . <$$font> ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.509

Pilate saith unto them , Take him yourselves , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.510

and crucify him : ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.511

for I find no crime in him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.512

The Jews answered him , We have a law , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.513

and by that law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.514

When Pilate therefore heard this saying , he was the more afraid ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.515

and he entered into the palace again , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.516

and saith unto Jesus , Whence art thou ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.517

But Jesus gave him no answer . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.518

Pilate therefore saith unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.519

knowest thou not that I have power to release thee , and have power to
crucify thee ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.520

Jesus answered him , Thou wouldest have no power against me , except it
were given thee from above : ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.521

therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.522

Upon this Pilate sought to release him : ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.523

but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou release this man , thou art
not Caesar's friend ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.524

every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.525

When Pilate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.526

and sat down on the judgement-seat at a place called The Pavement , but
in Hebrew , Gabbatha . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.527

Now it was the Preparation of the passover : ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.528

it was about the sixth hour , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.529

And he saith unto the Jews , Behold , your King !
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.530

They therefore cried out , Away with <font> him , <$$font> away with
<font> him , <$$font> ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.531

crucify him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.532

Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.533

The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.534

Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.535

They took Jesus therefore ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.536

and he went out , bearing the cross for himself , unto the place called
The place of a skull , which is called in Hebrew Golgotha : where they
crucified him , and with him two others , on either side one , and Jesus
in the midst . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.537

And Pilate wrote a title also , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.538

and put it on the cross . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.539

And there was written , Jesus of Nazareth , the King of the Jews .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,1J.540

<P_19,20J> This title therefore read many of the Jews :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.541

for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.542

and it was written in Hebrew , <font> and <$$font> in Latin , <font> and
<$$font> in Greek . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.543

The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate , Write not , The
King of the Jews ; but , that he said , I am King of the Jews .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.544

Pilate answered , What I have written I have written .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.545

The soldiers therefore , when they had crucified Jesus , took his
garments , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.546

and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also the coat :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.547

now the coat was without seam , woven from the top through-out .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.548

They said therefore one to another , Let us not rend it , but cast lots
for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled ,
which saith , They parted my garments among them ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.549

And upon my vesture did they cast lots . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.550

These things therefore the soldiers did . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.551

But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his
mother's sister , Mary the <font> wife <$$font> of Clopas , and Mary
Magdalene . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.552

When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by ,
whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold , thy son !
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.553

Then saith he to the disciple , Behold , thy mother !
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.554

And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own <font> home .
<$$font> ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.555

After this Jesus , knowing that all things are now finished , that the
scripture might be accomplished , saith , I thirst .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.556

There was set there a vessel full of vinegar : ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.557

so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.558

and brought it to his mouth . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.559

When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished
: ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.560

and he bowed his head , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.561

and gave up his spirit . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.562

The Jews therefore , because it was the Preparation , that the bodies
should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath <paren> for the day of
that sabbath was a high <font> day <$$font> <$$paren> , asked of Pilate
that their legs might be broken , and <font> that <$$font> they might be
taken away . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.563

The soldiers therefore came , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.564

and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified
with him : ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.565

but when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they
brake not his legs : ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.566

howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.567

and straightway there came out blood and water .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.568

And he that hath seen hath borne witness , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.569

and his witness is true : ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.570

and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye also may believe .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.571

For these things came to pass , that the scripture might be fulfilled ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.572

A bone of him shall not be broken . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.573

And again another scripture saith , They shall look on him whom they
pierced . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.574

And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus
, but secretly for fear of the Jews , asked of Pilate that he might take
away the body of Jesus : ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.575

and Pilate gave <font> him <$$font> leave . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.576

He came therefore , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.577

and took away his body . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.578

And there came also Nicodemus , he who at the first came to him by night
, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a_hundred pound <font>
weight . <$$font> ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,20J.579

<P_19,40J>

So they took the body of Jesus , ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,40J.581

and bound it in linen cloths with the spices , as the custom of the Jews
is to bury . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,40J.582

Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the
garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,40J.583

There then because of the Jews' Preparation <paren> for the tomb was
nigh at hand <$$paren> they laid Jesus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,19,40J.584

<P_20,1J>

Now on the first <font> day <$$font> of the week cometh Mary Magdalene
early , while it was yet dark , unto the tomb , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.586

and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.587

She runneth therefore , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.588

and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved
, ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.589

and saith unto them , They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.590

and we know not where they have laid him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.591

Peter therefore went forth , and the other disciple ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.592

and they went toward the tomb . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.593

And they ran both together : ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.594

and the other disciple outran Peter , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.595

and came first to the tomb ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.596

and stooping and looking in , he seeth the linen cloths lying ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.597

yet entered he not in . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.598

Simon Peter therefore also cometh , following him ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.599

and entered into the tomb ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.600

and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying , and the napkin , that was upon
his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but rolled up in a place by
itself . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.601

Then entered in therefore the other disciple also , which came first to
the tomb , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.602

and he saw , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.603

and believed . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.604

For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from
the dead . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.605

So the disciples went away again unto their own home .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.606

But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.607

so , as she wept , she stooped ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.608

and looked into the tomb ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.609

and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting , one at the head , and
one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.610

And they say unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.611

She saith unto them , Because they have taken away my Lord ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.612

and I know not where they have laid him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.613

When she had thus said , she turned herself back ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.614

and beholdeth Jesus standing , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.615

and knew not that it was Jesus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.616

Jesus saith unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.617

whom seekest thou ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.618

She , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , Sir , if thou
hast borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will
take him away . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.619

Jesus saith unto her , Mary . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.620

She turneth herself , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.621

and saith unto him in Hebrew , Rabboni ; which is to say , Master .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.622

Jesus saith to her , Touch me not ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.623

for I am not yet ascended unto the Father : ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.624

but go unto my brethren , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.625

and say to them , I ascend unto my Father and your Father , and my God
and your God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.626

Mary Magdalene cometh ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.627

and telleth the disciples , I have seen the Lord ; and <font> how that
<$$font> he had said these things unto her . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.628

When therefore it was evening , on that day , the first <font> day
<$$font> of the week , and when the doors were shut where the disciples
were , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.629

and stood in the midst , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.630

and saith unto them , Peace <font> be <$$font> unto you .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,1J.631

<P_20,20J> And when he had said this , he shewed unto them his hands and
his side . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.632

The disciples therefore were glad , when they saw the Lord .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.633

Jesus therefore said to them again , Peace <font> be <$$font> unto you :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.634

as the Father hath sent me , even so send I you .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.635

And when he had said this , he breathed on them ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.636

and saith unto them , Receive ye the Holy-Ghost ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.637

whose soever sins ye forgive , they are forgiven unto them ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.638

whose soever <font> sins <$$font> ye retain , they are retained .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.639

But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when
Jesus came . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.640

The other disciples therefore said unto him , We have seen the Lord .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.641

But he said unto them , Except I shall see in his hands the print of the
nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and put my hand
into his side , I will not believe . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.642

And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with
them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.643

Jesus cometh , the doors being shut , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.644

and stood in the midst , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.645

and said , Peace <font> be <$$font> unto you .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.646

Then saith he to Thomas , Reach hither thy finger ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.647

and see my hands ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.648

and reach <font> hither <$$font> thy hand , ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.649

and put it into my side : ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.650

and be not faithless , but believing . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.651

Thomas answered ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.652

and said unto him , My Lord and my God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.653

Jesus saith unto him , Because <font> thou <$$font> hast seen me , thou
hast believed : ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.654

blessed <font> are <$$font> they that have not seen , and <font> yet
<$$font> have believed . ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.655

Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples ,
which are not written in this book : ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.656

but these are written , that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ ,
the Son of God ; and that believing ye may have life in his name .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,20,20J.657

<P_21,1J> After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the
disciples at the sea of Tiberias ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.658

and he manifested <font> himself <$$font> on this wise .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.659

There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and
Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the <font> sons <$$font> of Zebedee ,
and two other of his disciples . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.660

Simon Peter saith unto them , I go a fishing . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.661

They say unto him , We also come with thee . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.662

They went forth , ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.663

and entered into the boat ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.664

and that night they took nothing . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.665

But when day was now breaking , Jesus stood on the beach :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.666

howbeit the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.667

Jesus therefore saith unto them , Children , have ye aught to eat ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.668

They answered him , No . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.669

And he said unto them , Cast the net on the right side of the boat , and
ye shall find . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.670

They cast therefore , ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.671

and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.672

That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter , It is the
Lord . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.673

So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his coat about
him ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.674

<paren> for he was naked <$$paren> , ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.675

and cast himself into the sea . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.676

But the other disciples came in the little boat <paren> for they were
not far from the land , but about two_hundred cubits off <$$paren> ,
dragging the net <font> full <$$font> of fishes .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.677

So when they got out upon the land , they see a fire of coals there ,
and fish laid thereon , and bread . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.678

Jesus saith unto them , Bring of the fish which ye have now taken .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.679

Simon Peter therefore went up , ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.680

and drew the net to land , full of great fishes ,
a_hundred_and_fifty_and_three : ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.681

and for all there were so many , the net was not rent .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.682

Jesus saith unto them , Come ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.683

<font> and <$$font> break your fast . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.684

And none of the disciples durst inquire of him , Who art thou ? knowing
that it was the Lord . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.685

Jesus cometh , ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.686

and taketh the bread , ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.687

and giveth them , and the fish likewise . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.688

This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples ,
after that he was risen from the dead . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.689

So when they had broken their fast , Jesus saith to Simon Peter , Simon
, <font> son <$$font> of John , lovest thou me more than these ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.690

He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.691

thou knowest that I love thee . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.692

He saith unto him , Feed my lambs . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.693

He saith to him again a second time , Simon , <font> son <$$font> of
John , lovest thou me ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.694

He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.695

thou knowest that I love thee . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.696

He saith unto him , Tend my sheep . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.697

He saith unto him the third time , Simon , <font> son <$$font> of John ,
lovest thou me ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.698

Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time , Lovest thou
me ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.699

And he said unto him , Lord , thou knowest all things ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.700

thou knowest that I love thee . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.701

Jesus saith unto him , Feed my sheep . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.702

Verily , verily , I say unto thee , When thou wast young , thou girdedst
thyself , ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.703

and walkedst whither thou wouldest : ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.704

but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.705

and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.706

Now this he spake , signifying by what manner of death he should glorify
God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.707

And when he had spoken this , he saith unto him , Follow me .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,1J.708

<P_21,20J> Peter , turning about , seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
following ; which also leaned back on his breast at the supper , and
said , Lord , who is he that betrayeth thee ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,20J.709

Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus , Lord , and what shall this
man do ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,20J.710

Jesus saith unto him , If I will that he tarry till I come , what <font>
is that <$$font> to thee ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,20J.711

follow thou me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,20J.712

This saying therefore went forth among the brethren , that that disciple
should not die : ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,20J.713

yet Jesus said not unto him , that he should not die ; but , If I will
that he tarry till I come , what <font> is that <$$font> to thee ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,20J.714

This is the disciple which beareth witness of these things , and wrote
these things : ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,20J.715

and we know that his witness is true . ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,20J.716

And there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which if they
should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself would
not contain the books that should be written .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,21,20J.717

<P_1,1A>

<heading>

The Acts of the Apostles . ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.720

<$$heading>

The former treatise I made , O Theophilus , concerning all that Jesus
began both to do and to teach , until the day in which he was received
up , after that he had given commandment through the Holy Ghost unto the
apostles whom he had chosen : to whom he also shewed himself alive after
his passion by many proofs , appearing unto them by the space of forty
days , and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.722

and , being assembled together with them , he charged them not to depart
from Jerusalem , but to wait for the promise of the Father , which ,
<font> said he , <$$font> ye heard from me : ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.723

for John indeed baptized with water ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.724

but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.725

They therefore , when they were come together , asked him , saying ,
Lord , dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.726

And he said unto them , It is not for you to know times or seasons ,
which the Father hath set within his own authority .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.727

But ye shall receive power , when the Holy Ghost is come upon you :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.728

and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem , and in all Judaea and
Samaria , and unto the uttermost part of the earth .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.729

And when he had said these things , as they were looking , he was taken
up ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.730

and a cloud received him out of their sight . ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.731

And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went , behold ,
two men stood by them in white apparel ; which also said , Ye men of
Galilee , why stand ye looking into heaven ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.732

this Jesus , which was received up from you into heaven , shall so come
in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.733

Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet , which
is nigh unto Jerusalem , a sabbath day's journey off .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.734

And when they were come in , they went up into the upper chamber , where
they were abiding ; both Peter and John and James and Andrew , Philip
and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James <font> the son <$$font> of
Alphaeus , and Simon the Zealot , and Judas <font> the son <$$font> of
James . ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.735

These all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer , with the
women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brethren .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.736

And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.737

and said <paren> and there was a multitude of persons <font> gathered
<$$font> together , about a_hundred_and_twenty <$$paren> , Brethren , it
was needful that the scripture should be fulfilled , which the Holy
Ghost spake before by the mouth of David concerning Judas , who was
guide to them that took Jesus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.738

For he was numbered among us , ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.739

and received his portion in this ministry . ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.740

<paren> Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.741

and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the midst ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.742

and all his bowels gushed out . ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.743

And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem ; insomuch that in
their language that field was called Akeldama , that is , The field of
blood . <$$paren> ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,1A.744

<P_1,20A>

For it is written in the book of Psalms , Let his habitation be made
desolate , ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,20A.746

And let no man dwell therein : ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,20A.747

and , His office let another take . ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,20A.748

Of the men therefore which have companied with us all the time that the
Lord Jesus went in and went out among us , beginning from the baptism of
John , unto the day that he was received up from us , of these must one
become a witness with us of his resurrection . ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,20A.749

And they put forward two , Joseph called Barsabbas , who was surnamed
Justus , and Matthias . ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,20A.750

And they prayed , ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,20A.751

and said , Thou , Lord , which knowest the hearts of all men , shew of
these two the one whom thou hast chosen , to take the place in this
ministry and apostleship , from which Judas fell away , that he might go
to his own place . ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,20A.752

And they gave lots for them ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,20A.753

and the lot fell upon Matthias ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,20A.754

and he was numbered with the eleven apostles . ERV-NEW-1881-2,1,20A.755

<P_2,1A>

And when the day of Pentecost was now come , they were all together in
one place . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.757

And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a
mighty wind , ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.758

and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.759

And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder , like as of fire ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.760

and it sat upon each one of them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.761

And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.762

and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them
utterance . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.763

Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews , devout men , from every
nation under heaven . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.764

And when this sound was heard , the multitude came together ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.765

and were confounded , because that every man heard them speaking in his
own language . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.766

And they were all amazed ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.767

and marvelled , saying , Behold , are not all these which speak
Galilaeans ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.768

And how hear we , every man in our own language , wherein we were born ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.769

Parthians and Medes and Elamites , and the dwellers in Mesopotamia , in
Judaea and Cappadocia , in Pontus and Asia , in Phrygia and Pamphylia ,
in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene , and sojourners from Rome
, both Jews and proselytes , Cretans and Arabians , we do hear them
speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.770

And they were all amazed , ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.771

and were perplexed , saying one to another , What meaneth this ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.772

But others mocking said , They are filled with new wine .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.773

But Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.774

and spake forth unto them , <font> saying , <$$font> Ye men of Judaea ,
and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem , be this known unto you ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.775

and give ear unto my words . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.776

For these are not drunken , as ye suppose ; seeing it is <font> but
<$$font> the third hour of the day ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.777

but this is that which hath been spoken by the prophet Joel ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.778

And it shall be in the last days , saith God , I will pour forth of my
Spirit upon all flesh : ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.779

And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.780

And your young men shall see visions , ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.781

And your old men shall dream dreams : ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.782

Yea and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days Will I pour
forth of my Spirit ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.783

and they shall prophesy . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.784

And I will shew wonders in the heaven above , And signs on the earth
beneath ; Blood , and fire , and vapour of smoke :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,1A.785

<P_2,20A>

The sun shall be turned into darkness , And the moon into blood , Before
the day of the Lord come , That great and notable <font> day <$$font> :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.787

And it shall be , that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord
shall be saved . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.788

Ye men of Israel , hear these words : ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.789

Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved of God unto you by mighty works and
wonders and signs , which God did by him in the midst of you , even as
ye yourselves know ; him , being delivered up by the determinate counsel
and foreknowledge of God , ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and
slay : whom God raised up , having loosed the pangs of death : because
it was not possible that he should be holden of it .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.790

For David saith concerning him , I beheld the Lord always before my face
; ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.791

For he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.792

Therefore my heart was glad , ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.793

and my tongue rejoiced ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.794

Moreover my flesh also shall dwell in hope : Because thou wilt not leave
my soul in Hades , ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.795

Neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.796

Thou madest known unto me the ways of life ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.797

Thou shalt make me full of gladness with thy countenance .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.798

Brethren , I may say unto you freely of the patriarch David , that he
both died and was buried , and his tomb is with us unto this day .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.799

Being therefore a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath
to him , that of the fruit of his loins he would set <font> one <$$font>
upon his throne ; he foreseeing <font> this <$$font> spake of the
resurrection of the Christ , that neither was he left in Hades , nor did
his flesh see corruption . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.800

This Jesus did God raise up , whereof we all are witnesses .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.801

Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted , and having received
of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost , he hath poured forth this
, which ye see and hear . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.802

For David ascended not into the heavens : ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.803

but he saith himself , The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right
hand , Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.804

Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly , that God hath
made him both Lord and Christ , this Jesus whom ye crucified .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.805

Now when they heard <font> this , <$$font> they were pricked in their
heart , ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.806

and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles , Brethren , what shall
we do ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.807

And Peter <font> said <$$font> unto them , Repent ye , and be baptized
every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your
sins ; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.808

For to you is the promise , and to your children , and to all that are
afar off , <font> even <$$font> as many as the Lord our God shall call
unto him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,20A.809

<P_2,40A>

And with many other words he testified , ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.811

and exhorted them , saying , Save yourselves from this crooked
generation . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.812

They then that received his word were baptized ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.813

and there were added <font> unto them <$$font> in that day about
three_thousand souls . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.814

And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship ,
in the breaking of bread and the prayers . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.815

And fear came upon every soul : ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.816

and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.817

And all that believed were together , ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.818

and had all things common ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.819

and they sold their possessions and goods , ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.820

and parted them to all , according as any man had need .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.821

And day by day , continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple ,
and breaking bread at home , they did take their food with gladness and
singleness of heart , praising God , and having favour with all the
people . ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.822

And the Lord added to them day by day those that were being saved .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,2,40A.823

<P_3,1A>

Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer ,
<font> being <$$font> the ninth <font> hour . <$$font>
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.825

And a certain man that was lame from his mother's womb was carried ,
whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful
, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple ; who seeing Peter
and John about to go into the temple , asked to receive an alms .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.826

And Peter , fastening his eyes upon him , with John , said , Look on us
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.827

And he gave heed unto them , expecting to receive something from them .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.828

But Peter said , Silver and gold have I none ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.829

but what I have , that give I thee , ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.830

In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , walk .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.831

And he took him by the right hand , ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.832

and raised him up : ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.833

and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.834

And leaping up , he stood , ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.835

and began to walk ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.836

and he entered with them into the temple , walking , and leaping , and
praising God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.837

And all the people saw him walking and praising God :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.838

and they took knowledge of him , that it was he which sat for alms at
the Beautiful Gate of the temple : ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.839

and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had
happened unto him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.840

And as he held Peter and John , all the people ran together unto them in
the porch that is called Solomon's , greatly wondering .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.841

And when Peter saw it , he answered unto the people , Ye men of Israel ,
why marvel ye at this man ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.842

or why fasten ye your eyes on us , as though by our own power or
godliness we had made him to walk ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.843

The God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Jacob , the God of our
fathers , hath glorified his Servant Jesus ; whom ye delivered up , and
denied before the face of Pilate , when he had determined to release him
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.844

But ye denied the Holy and Righteous One , ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.845

and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.846

and killed the Prince of life ; whom God raised from the dead ; whereof
we are witnesses . ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.847

And by faith in his name hath his name made this man strong , whom ye
behold and know : ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.848

yea , the faith which is through him hath given him this perfect
soundness in the presence of you all . ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.849

And now , brethren , I wot that in ignorance ye did it , as did also
your rulers . ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.850

But the things which God foreshewed by the mouth of all the prophets ,
that his Christ should suffer , he thus fulfilled .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.851

Repent ye therefore , ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,1A.852

and turn again , that your sins may be blotted out , that so there may
come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord ; <P_3,20A> and
that he may send the Christ who hath been appointed for you , <font>
even <$$font> Jesus : whom the heaven must receive until the times of
restoration of all things , whereof God spake by the mouth of his holy
prophets which have been since the world began .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,20A.853

Moses indeed said , A prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you from
among your brethren , like unto me ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,20A.854

to him shall ye hearken in all things whatsoever he shall speak unto you
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,20A.855

And it shall be , that every soul , which shall not hearken to that
prophet , shall be utterly destroyed from among the people .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,20A.856

Yea and all the prophets from Samuel and them that followed after , as
many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,20A.857

Ye are the sons of the prophets , and of the covenant which God made
with your fathers , saying unto Abraham , And in thy seed shall all the
families of the earth be blessed . ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,20A.858

Unto you first God , having raised up his Servant , sent him to bless
you , in turning away every one of you from your iniquities .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,3,20A.859

<P_4,1A>

And as they spake unto the people , the priests and the captain of the
temple and the Sadducees came upon them , being sore troubled because
they taught the people , and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from
the dead . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.861

And they laid hands on them , ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.862

and put them in ward unto the morrow : ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.863

for it was now eventide . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.864

But many of them that heard the word believed ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.865

and the number of the men came to be about five_thousand .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.866

And it came to pass on the morrow , that their rulers and elders and
scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.867

and Annas the high priest <font> was there , <$$font> and Caiaphas , and
John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high
priest . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.868

And when they had set them in the midst , they enquired , By what power
, or in what name , have ye done this ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.869

Then Peter , filled with the Holy Ghost , said unto them , Ye rulers of
the people , and elders , if we this day are examined concerning a good
deed done to an impotent man , by what means this man is made whole ; be
it known unto you all , and to all the people of Israel , that in the
name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom ye crucified , whom God raised
from the dead , <font> even <$$font> in him doth this man stand here
before you whole . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.870

He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders , which was
made the head of the corner . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.871

And in none other is there salvation : ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.872

for neither is there any other name under heaven , that is given among
men , wherein we must be saved . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.873

Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John , and had perceived
that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marvelled ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.874

and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with Jesus .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.875

And seeing the man which was healed standing with them , they could say
nothing against it . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.876

But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they
conferred among themselves , saying , What shall we do to these men ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.877

for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them , is
manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.878

and we can@ @not deny it . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.879

But that it spread no further among the people , let us threaten them ,
that they speak henceforth to no man in this name .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.880

And they called them , ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.881

and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.882

But Peter and John answered ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.883

and said unto them , Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken
unto you rather than unto God , judge ye : ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,1A.884

<P_4,20A>

for we can@ @not but speak the things which we saw and heard .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.886

And they , when they had further threatened them , let them go , finding
nothing how they might punish them , because of the people ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.887

for all men glorified God for that which was done .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.888

For the man was more than forty years old , on whom this miracle of
healing was wrought . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.889

And being let go , they came to their own company ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.890

and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto
them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.891

And they , when they heard it , lifted up their voice to God with one
accord , ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.892

and said , O Lord , thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and
the sea , and all that in them is who by the Holy Ghost , <font> by
<$$font> the mouth of our father David thy servant , didst say , Why did
the Gentiles rage , And the peoples imagine vain things ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.893

The kings of the earth set themselves in array ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.894

And the rulers were gathered together , Against the Lord , and against
his Anointed : ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.895

for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus , whom thou
didst anoint , both Herod and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles and the
peoples of Israel , were gathered together , to do whatsoever thy hand
and thy counsel foreordained to come to pass . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.896

And now , Lord , look upon their threatenings : ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.897

and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness , while
thou stretches forth thy hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may
be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.898

And when they had prayed , the place was shaken wherein they were
gathered together ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.899

and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.900

and they spake the word of God with boldness . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.901

And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.902

and not one <font> of them <$$font> said that aught of the things which
he possessed was his own ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.903

but they had all things common . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.904

And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection
of the Lord Jesus : ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.905

and great grace was upon them all . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.906

For neither was there among them any that lacked :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.907

for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.908

and brought the prices of the things that were sold ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.909

and laid them at the apostles' feet : ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.910

and distribution was made unto each , according as any one had need .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.911

And Joseph , who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas <paren> which is
, being interpreted , Son of exhortation <$$paren> , a Levite , a man of
Cyprus by race , having a field , sold it , ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.912

and brought the money , ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.913

and laid it at the apostles' feet . ERV-NEW-1881-2,4,20A.914

<P_5,1A>

But a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira his wife , sold a
possession , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.916

and kept back <font> part <$$font> of the price , his wife also being
privy to it , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.917

and brought a certain part , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.918

and laid it at the apostles' feet . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.919

But Peter said , Ananias , why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the
Holy Ghost , and to keep back <font> part <$$font> of the price of the
land ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.920

While {TEXT:Whiles} it remained , did it not remain thine own ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.921

and after it was sold , was it not in thy power ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.922

How is it that thou hast conceived this thing in thy heart ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.923

thou hast not lied unto men , but unto God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.924

And Ananias hearing these words fell down ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.925

and gave up the ghost : ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.926

and great fear came upon all that heard it ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.927

And the young men arose ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.928

and wrapped him round , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.929

and they carried him out ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.930

and buried him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.931

And it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not
knowing what was done , came in . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.932

And Peter answered unto her , Tell me whether ye sold the land for so
much . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.933

And she said , Yea , for so much . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.934

But Peter <font> said <$$font> unto her , How is it that ye have agreed
together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.935

behold , the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door
, ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.936

and they shall carry thee out . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.937

And she fell down immediately at his feet , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.938

and gave up the ghost : ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.939

and the young men came in ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.940

and found her dead , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.941

and they carried her out ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.942

and buried her by her husband . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.943

And great fear came upon the whole church , and upon all that heard
these things . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.944

And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought
among the people ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.945

and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.946

But of the rest durst no man join himself to them :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.947

howbeit the people magnified them ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.948

and believers were the more added to the Lord , multitudes both of men
and women ; insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the
streets , and laid them on beds and couches , that , as Peter came by ,
at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.949

And there also came together the multitude from the cities round about
Jerusalem , bringing sick folk , and them that were vexed with unclean
spirits : ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.950

and they were healed every one . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.951

But the high priest rose up , and all they that were with him <paren>
which is the sect of the Sadducees <$$paren> , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.952

and they were filled with jealousy , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.953

and laid hands on the apostles , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.954

and put them in public ward . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.955

But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.956

and brought them out , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,1A.957

<P_5,20A>

and said , Go ye , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.959

and stand ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.960

and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.961

And when they heard <font> this , <$$font> they entered into the temple
about daybreak , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.962

and taught . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.963

But the high priest came , and they that were with him ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.964

and called the council together , and all the senate of the children of
Israel , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.965

and sent to the prison-house to have them brought
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.966

But the officers that came found them not in the prison ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.967

and they returned , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.968

and told , saying , The prison-house we found shut in all safety , and
the keepers standing at the doors : ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.969

but when we had opened , we found no man within .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.970

Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these
words , they were much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would
grow . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.971

And there came one ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.972

and told them , Behold , the men whom ye put in the prison are in the
temple standing and teaching the people . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.973

Then went the captain with the officers , ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.974

and brought them , <font> but <$$font> without violence ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.975

for they feared the people , lest they should be stoned .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.976

And when they had brought them , they set them before the council ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.977

And the high priest asked them , saying , We straitly charged you not to
teach in this name : ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.978

and behold , ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.979

and intend to bring this man's blood upon us . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.980

But Peter and the apostles answered ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.981

and said , We must obey God rather than men . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.982

The God of , our fathers raised up Jesus , whom ye slew , hanging him on
a tree . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.983

Him did God exalt with his right hand <font> to be <$$font> a Prince and
a Saviour , for to give repentance to Israel , and remission of sins .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.984

And we are witnesses of these things ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.985

and <font> so is <$$font> the Holy Ghost , whom God hath given to them
that obey him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.986

But they , when they heard this , were cut to the heart ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.987

and were minded to slay them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.988

But there stood up one in the council , a Pharisee , named Gamaliel , a
doctor of the law , had in honour of all the people ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.989

and commanded to put the men forth a little while ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.990

And he said unto them , Ye men of Israel , take heed to yourselves as
touching these men , what ye are about to do . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.991

For before these days rose up Theudas , giving himself out to be
somebody ; to whom a number of men , about four_hundred , joined
themselves : who was slain ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.992

and all , as many as obeyed him , were dispersed ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.993

and came to nought . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.994

After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the enrolment ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.995

and drew away <font> some of the <$$font> people after him :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.996

he also perished ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.997

and all , as many as obeyed him , were scattered abroad .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.998

And now I say unto you , Refrain from these men ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.999

and let them alone : ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.1000

for if this counsel or this work be of men , it will be overthrown ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.1001

but if it is of God , ye will not be able to overthrow them ; lest haply
ye be found even to be fighting against God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,20A.1002

<P_5,40A>

And to him they agreed : ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,40A.1004

and when they had called the apostles unto them , they beat them
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,40A.1005

and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,40A.1006

and let them go . ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,40A.1007

They therefore departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour for the Name .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,40A.1008

And every day , in the temple and at home , they ceased not to teach and
to preach Jesus <font> as <$$font> the Christ .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,5,40A.1009

<P_6,1A>

Now in these days , when the number of the disciples was multiplying ,
there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews ,
because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1011

And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1012

and said , It is not fit that we should forsake the word of God , and
serve tables . ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1013

Look ye out therefore , brethren , from among you seven men of good
report , full of the Spirit and of wisdom , whom we may appoint over
this business . ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1014

But we will continue stedfastly in prayer , and in the ministry of the
word . ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1015

And the saying pleased the whole multitude : ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1016

and they chose Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit ,
and Philip , and Prochorus , and Nicanor , and Timon , and Parmenas ,
and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch : whom they set before the apostles :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1017

and when they had prayed , they laid their hands on them .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1018

And the word of God increased ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1019

and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1020

and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1021

And Stephen , full of grace and power , wrought great wonders and signs
among the people . ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1022

But there arose certain of them that were of the synagogue called <font>
the synagogue <$$font> of the Libertines , and of the Cyrenians , and of
the Alexandrians , and of them of Cilicia and Asia , disputing with
Stephen . ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1023

And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which
he spake . ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1024

Then they suborned men , which said , We have heard him speak
blasphemous words against Moses , and <font> against <$$font> God .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1025

And they stirred up the people , and the elders , and the scribes ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1026

and came upon him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1027

and seized him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1028

and brought him into the council , ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1029

and set up false witnesses , which said , This man ceaseth not to speak
words against this holy place , and the law : ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1030

for we have heard him say , that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy
this place , and shall change the customs which Moses delivered unto us
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1031

And all that sat in the council , fastening their eyes on him , saw his
face as it had been the face of an angel . ERV-NEW-1881-2,6,1A.1032

<P_7,1A>

And the high priest said , Are these things so ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1034

And he said , Brethren and fathers , hearken . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1035

The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham , when he was in
Mesopotamia , before he dwelt in Haran , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1036

and said unto him , Get thee out of thy land , and from thy kindred ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1037

and come into the land which I shall shew thee .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1038

Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1039

and dwelt in Haran ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1040

and from thence , when his father was dead , <font> God <$$font> removed
him into this land , wherein ye now dwell : ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1041

and he gave him none inheritance in it , no , not so much as to set his
foot on : ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1042

and he promised that he would give it to him in possession , and to his
seed after him , when <font> as yet <$$font> he had no child .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1043

And God spake on this wise , that his seed should sojourn in a strange
land , and that they should bring them into bondage , and entreat them
evil , four_hundred years . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1044

And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge , said God
: ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1045

and after that shall they come forth , and serve me in this place .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1046

And he gave him the covenant of circumcision : ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1047

and so <font> Abraham <$$font> begat Isaac , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1048

and circumcised him the eighth day ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1049

and Isaac <font> begat <$$font> Jacob , and Jacob the twelve patriarchs
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1050

And the patriarchs , moved with jealousy against Joseph , sold him into
Egypt ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1051

and God was with him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1052

and delivered him out of all his afflictions ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1053

and gave him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1054

and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1055

Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan , and great affliction
: ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1056

and our fathers found no sustenance . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1057

But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt , he sent forth our
fathers the first time . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1058

And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1059

and Joseph's race became manifest unto Pharaoh .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1060

And Joseph sent , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1061

and called to him Jacob his father , and all his kindred ,
threescore_and_fifteen souls . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1062

And Jacob went down into Egypt ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1063

and he died , himself , and our fathers ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1064

and they were carried over unto Shechem , and laid in the tomb that
Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1065

But as the time of the promise drew nigh , which God vouchsafed unto
Abraham , the people grew and multiplied in Egypt , till there arose
another king over Egypt , which knew not Joseph .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1066

The same dealt subtilly with our race , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,1A.1067

and evil entreated our fathers , that they should cast out their babes
to the end they might not live . <P_7,20A> At which season Moses was
born , and was exceeding fair ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1068

and he was nourished three months in his father's house :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1069

and when he was cast out , Pharaoh's daughter took him up ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1070

and nourished him for her own son . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1071

And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1072

and he was mighty in his words and works . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1073

But when he was well-nigh forty years old , it came into his heart to
visit his brethren the children of Israel . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1074

And seeing one <font> of them <$$font> suffer wrong , he defended him ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1075

and avenged him that was oppressed , smiting the Egyptian :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1076

and he supposed that his brethren understood how that God by his hand
was giving them deliverance ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1077

but they understood not . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1078

And the day following he appeared unto them as they strove ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1079

and would have set them at one again , saying , Sirs , ye are brethren ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1080

why do ye wrong one to another ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1081

But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away , saying , Who made
thee a ruler and a judge over us ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1082

Wouldest thou kill me , as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1083

And Moses fled at this saying , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1084

and became a sojourner in the land of Midian , where he begat two sons .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1085

And when forty years were fulfilled , an angel appeared to him in the
wilderness of mount Sinai , in a flame of fire in a bush .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1086

And when Moses saw it , he wondered at the sight :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1087

and as he drew near to behold , there came a voice of the Lord ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1088

I am the God of thy fathers , the God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of
Jacob . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1089

And Moses trembled , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1090

and durst not behold . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1091

And the Lord said unto him , Loose the shoes from thy feet ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1092

for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1093

I have surely seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1094

and have heard their groaning , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1095

and I am come down to deliver them : ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1096

and now come , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1097

I will send thee into Egypt . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1098

This Moses whom they refused , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a
judge ? him hath God sent <font> to be <$$font> both a ruler and a
deliverer with the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1099

This man led them forth , having wrought wonders and signs in Egypt ,
and in the Red Sea {TEXT:sea} , and in the wilderness forty years .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1100

This is that Moses , which said unto the children of Israel , A prophet
shall God raise up unto you from among your brethren , like unto me .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,20A.1101

This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which
spake to him in the mount Sinai , and with our fathers : who received
living oracles to give unto us : to whom our fathers would not be
obedient , but thrust him from them , and turned back in their hearts
unto Egypt , <P_7,40A> saying unto Aaron , Make us gods which shall go
before us : ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1102

for as for this Moses , which led us forth out of the land of Egypt , we
wot not what is become of him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1103

And they made a calf in those days , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1104

and brought a sacrifice unto the idol , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1105

and rejoiced in the works of their hands . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1106

But God turned , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1107

and gave them up to serve the host of heaven ; as it is written in the
book of the prophets , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1108

Did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices Forty years in the
wilderness , O house of Israel ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1109

And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch , And the star of the god Rephan
, The figures which ye made to worship them : ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1110

And I will carry you away beyond Babylon . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1111

Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness , even
as he appointed who spake unto Moses , that he should make it according
to the figure that he had seen . Which also our fathers , in their turn
, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the
nations , which God thrust out before the face of our fathers , unto the
days of David ; who found favour in the sight of God , and asked to find
a habitation for the God of Jacob , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1112

But Solomon built him a house . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1113

Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in <font> houses <$$font> made with
hands ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1114

as saith the prophet , The heaven is my throne , And the earth the
footstool of my feet : ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1115

What manner of house will ye build me ? Saith the Lord :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1116

Or what is the place of my rest ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1117

Did not my hand make all these things ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1118

Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , ye do always resist
the Holy Ghost : ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1119

as your fathers did , so do ye . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1120

Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1121

and they killed them which shewed before of the coming of the Righteous
One ; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers ; ye who
received the law as it was ordained by angels , and kept it not .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1122

Now when they heard these things , they were cut to the heart ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1123

and they gnashed on him with their teeth . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1124

But he , being full of the Holy Ghost , looked up stedfastly into heaven
, ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1125

and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1126

and said , Behold , I see the heavens opened , and the Son of man
standing on the right hand of God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1127

But they cried out with a loud voice , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1128

and stopped their ears , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1129

and rushed upon him with one accord ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1130

and they cast him out of the city , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1131

and stoned him : ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1132

and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man
named Saul . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1133

And they stoned Stephen , calling upon <font> the Lord , <$$font> and
saying , Lord Jesus , receive my spirit . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,40A.1134

<P_7,60A>

And he kneeled down , ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,60A.1136

and cried with a loud voice , Lord , lay not this sin to their charge .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,60A.1137

And when he had said this , he fell asleep . ERV-NEW-1881-2,7,60A.1138

<P_8,1A>

And Saul was consenting unto his death . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1140

And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which
was in Jerusalem ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1141

and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and
Samaria , except the apostles . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1142

And devout men buried Stephen , ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1143

and made great lamentation over him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1144

But Saul laid waste the church , entering into every house ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1145

and haling men and women committed them to prison .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1146

They therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1147

And Philip went down to the city of Samaria , ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1148

and proclaimed unto them the Christ . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1149

And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were
spoken by Philip , when they heard , and saw the signs which he did .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1150

For <font> from <$$font> many of those which had unclean spirits , they
came out , crying with a loud voice : ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1151

and many that were palsied , and that were lame , were healed .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1152

And there was much joy in that city . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1153

But there was a certain man , Simon by name , which beforetime in the
city used sorcery , and amazed the people of Samaria , giving out that
himself was some great one : to whom they all gave heed , from the least
to the greatest , saying , This man is that power of God which is called
Great . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1154

And they gave heed to him , because that of long time he had amazed them
with his sorceries . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1155

But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the
kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both
men and women . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1156

And Simon also himself believed ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1157

and being baptized , he continued with Philip ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1158

and beholding signs and great miracles wrought , he was amazed .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1159

Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
received the word of God , they sent unto them Peter and John : who ,
when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the
Holy Ghost : ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1160

for as yet he was fallen upon none of them : ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1161

only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1162

Then laid they their hands on them , ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1163

and they received the Holy Ghost . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1164

Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles' hands the
Holy Ghost was given , he offered them money , saying , Give me also
this power , that on whomsoever I lay my hands , he may receive the Holy
Ghost . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,1A.1165

<P_8,20A>

But Peter said unto him , Thy silver perish with thee , because thou
hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1167

Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1168

for thy heart is not right before God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1169

Repent therefore of this thy wickedness , ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1170

and pray the Lord , if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be
forgiven thee . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1171

For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of
iniquity . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1172

And Simon answered ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1173

and said , Pray ye for me to the Lord , that none of the things which ye
have spoken come upon me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1174

They therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord
, returned to Jerusalem , ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1175

and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1176

But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip , saying , Arise ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1177

and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto
Gaza : ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1178

the same is desert . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1179

And he arose and went : ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1180

and behold , a man of Ethiopia , a eunuch of great authority under
Candace , queen of the Ethiopians , who was over all her treasure , who
had come to Jerusalem for to worship ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1181

and he was returning and sitting in his chariot ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1182

and was reading the prophet Isaiah . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1183

And the Spirit said unto Philip , Go near , ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1184

and join thyself to this chariot . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1185

And Philip ran to him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1186

and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1187

and said , Understandest thou what thou readest ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1188

And he said , How can I , except some one shall guide me ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1189

And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1190

Now the place of the scripture which he was reading was this , He was
led as a sheep to the slaughter ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1191

And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb , So he openeth not his mouth :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1192

In his humiliation his judgement was taken away :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1193

His generation who shall declare ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1194

For his life is taken from the earth . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1195

And the eunuch answered Philip , ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1196

and said , I pray thee , of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself
, or of some other ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1197

And Philip opened his mouth , ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1198

and beginning from this scripture , preached unto him Jesus .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1199

And as they went on the way , they came unto a certain water ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1200

and the eunuch saith , Behold , <font> here is <$$font> water ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1201

what doth hinder me to be baptized ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1202

And he commanded the chariot to stand still : ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1203

and they both went down into the water , both Philip and the eunuch ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1204

and he baptized him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1205

And when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught
away Philip ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1206

and the eunuch saw him no more , ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1207

for he went on his way rejoicing . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,20A.1208

<P_8,40A>

But Philip was found at Azotus : ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,40A.1210

and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities , till he
came to Caesarea . ERV-NEW-1881-2,8,40A.1211

<P_9,1A>

But Saul , yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples
of the Lord , went unto the high priest , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1213

and asked of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues , that if he
found any that were of the Way , whether men or women , he might bring
them bound to Jerusalem . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1214

And as he journeyed , it came to pass that he drew nigh unto Damascus :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1215

and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1216

and he fell upon the earth , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1217

and heard a voice saying unto him , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou
me ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1218

And he said , Who art thou , Lord ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1219

And he <font> said , <$$font> I am Jesus whom thou persecutest ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1220

but rise , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1221

and enter into the city , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1222

and it shall be told thee what thou must do . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1223

And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless , hearing the voice
, but beholding no man . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1224

And Saul arose from the earth ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1225

and when his eyes were opened , he saw nothing ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1226

and they led him by the hand , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1227

and brought him into Damascus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1228

And he was three days without sight , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1229

and did neither eat nor drink . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1230

Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named Ananias ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1231

and the Lord said unto him in a vision , Ananias .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1232

And he said , Behold , I <font> am here , <$$font> Lord .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1233

And the Lord <font> said <$$font> unto him , Arise ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1234

and go to the street which is called Straight , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1235

and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul , a man of Tarsus :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1236

for behold , he prayeth ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1237

and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in , and laying his hands on
him , that he might receive his sight . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1238

But Ananias answered , Lord , I have heard from many of this man , how
much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem : ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1239

and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call
upon thy name . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1240

But the Lord said unto him , Go thy way : ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1241

for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the Gentiles
and kings , and the children of Israel : ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1242

for I will shew him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1243

And Ananias departed , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1244

and entered into the house ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1245

and laying his hands on him said , Brother Saul , the Lord , <font> even
<$$font> Jesus , who appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest ,
hath sent me , that thou mayest receive thy sight , and be filled with
the Holy Ghost . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1246

And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1247

and he received his sight ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1248

and he arose ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1249

and was baptized ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1250

and he took food ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1251

and was strengthened . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1252

And he was certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,1A.1253

<P_9,20A>

And straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus , that he is the
Son of God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1255

And all that heard him were amazed , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1256

and said , Is not this he that in Jerusalem made havock of them which
called on this name ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1257

and he had come hither for this intent , that he might bring them bound
before the chief priests . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1258

But Saul increased the more in strength , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1259

and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus , proving that this is
the Christ . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1260

And when many days were fulfilled , the Jews took counsel together to
kill him : ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1261

but their plot became known to Saul . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1262

And they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1263

but his disciples took him by night , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1264

and let him down through the wall , lowering him in a basket .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1265

And when he was come to Jerusalem , he assayed to join himself to the
disciples : ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1266

and they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1267

But Barnabas took him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1268

and brought him to the apostles , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1269

and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he
had spoken to him , and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the
name of Jesus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1270

And he was with them going in and going out at Jerusalem , preaching
boldly in the name of the Lord : ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1271

and he spake and disputed against the Grecian Jews ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1272

but they went about to kill him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1273

And when the brethren knew it , they brought him down to Caesarea ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1274

and sent him forth to Tarsus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1275

So the church throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace ,
being edified ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1276

and , walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy
Ghost , was multiplied . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1277

And it came to pass , as Peter went throughout all parts , he came down
also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1278

And there he found a certain man named AEneas , which had kept his bed
eight years ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1279

for he was palsied . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1280

And Peter said unto him , AEneas , Jesus Christ healeth thee :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1281

arise , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1282

and make thy bed . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1283

And straightway he arose . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1284

And all that dwelt at Lydda and in Sharon saw him ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1285

and they turned to the Lord . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1286

Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , which by
interpretation is called Dorcas : ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1287

this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1288

And it came to pass in those days , that she fell sick , and died :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1289

and when they had washed her , they laid her in an upper chamber .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1290

And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa , the disciples , hearing that Peter
was there , sent two men unto him , intreating him , Delay not to come
on unto us . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1291

And Peter arose ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1292

and went with them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1293

And when he was come , they brought him into the upper chamber :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1294

and all the widows stood by him weeping , and shewing the coats and
garments which Dorcas made , while she was with them .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,20A.1295

<P_9,40A>

But Peter put them all forth , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1297

and kneeled down , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1298

and prayed ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1299

and turning to the body , he said , Tabitha , arise .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1300

And she opened her eyes ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1301

and when she saw Peter , she sat up . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1302

And he gave her his hand , ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1303

and raised her up ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1304

and calling the saints and widows , he presented her alive .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1305

And it became known throughout all Joppa : ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1306

and many believed on the Lord . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1307

And it came to pass , that he abode many days in Joppa with one Simon a
tanner . ERV-NEW-1881-2,9,40A.1308

<P_10,1A>

Now <font> there was <$$font> a certain man in Caesarea , Cornelius by
name , a centurion of the band called the Italian band , a devout man ,
and one that feared God with all his house , who gave much alms to the
people , and prayed to God alway . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1310

He saw in a vision openly , as it were about the ninth hour of the day ,
an angel of God coming in unto him , and saying to him , Cornelius .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1311

And he , fastening his eyes upon him , and being affrighted , said ,
What is it , Lord ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1312

And he said unto him , Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up for a
memorial before God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1313

And now send men to Joppa , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1314

and fetch one Simon , who is surnamed Peter : ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1315

he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner , whose house is by the sea side .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1316

And when the angel that spake unto him was departed , he called two of
his household-servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him
continually ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1317

and having rehearsed all things unto them , he sent them to Joppa .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1318

Now on the morrow , as they were on their journey , and drew nigh unto
the city , Peter went up upon the housetop to pray , about the sixth
hour : ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1319

and he became hungry , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1320

and desired to eat ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1321

but while they made ready , he fell into a trance ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1322

and he beholdeth the heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending ,
as it were a great sheet , let down by four corners upon the earth :
wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the
earth and fowls of the heaven . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1323

And there came a voice to him , Rise , Peter ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1324

kill and eat , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1325

But Peter said , Not so , Lord ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1326

for I have never eaten any thing that is common and unclean .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1327

And a voice <font> came <$$font> unto him again the second time , What
God hath cleansed , make not thou common . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1328

And this was done thrice : ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1329

and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1330

Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he
had seen might mean , behold , the men that were sent by Cornelius ,
having made inquiry for Simon's house , stood before the gate ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1331

and called ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1332

and asked whether Simon , which was surnamed . Peter , were lodging
there . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1333

And while Peter thought on the vision , the Spirit said unto him ,
Behold , three men seek thee . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,1A.1334

<P_10,20A>

But arise , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1336

and get thee down , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1337

and go with them , nothing doubting : ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1338

for I have sent them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1339

And Peter went down to the men , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1340

and said , Behold , I am he whom ye seek : ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1341

what is the cause wherefore ye are come ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1342

And they said , Cornelius a centurion , a righteous man and one that
feareth God , and well reported of by all the nation of the Jews , was
warned <font> of God <$$font> by a holy angel to send for thee into his
house , and to hear words from thee . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1343

So he called them in ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1344

and lodged them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1345

And on the morrow he arose ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1346

and went forth with them , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1347

and certain of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1348

And on the morrow they entered into Caesarea .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1349

And Cornelius was waiting for them , having called together his kinsmen
and his near friends . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1350

And when it came to pass that Peter entered , Cornelius met him ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1351

and fell down at his feet , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1352

and worshipped him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1353

But Peter raised him up , saying , Stand up ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1354

I myself also am a man . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1355

And as he talked with him , he went in , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1356

and findeth many come together : ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1357

and he said unto them , Ye yourselves know how that it is an unlawful
thing for a man that is a Jew to join himself or come unto one of
another nation ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1358

and <font> yet <$$font> unto me hath God shewed that I should not call
any man common or unclean : wherefore also I came without gainsaying ,
when I was sent for . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1359

I ask therefore with what intent ye sent for me .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1360

And Cornelius said , Four days ago , until this hour , I was keeping the
ninth hour of prayer in my house ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1361

and behold , a man stood before me in bright apparel ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1362

and saith , Cornelius , thy prayer is heard , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1363

and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1364

Send therefore to Joppa , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1365

and call unto thee Simon , who is surnamed Peter ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1366

he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner , by the sea side .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1367

Forthwith therefore I sent to thee ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1368

and thou hast well done that thou art come . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1369

Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God , to hear all
things that have been commanded thee of the Lord .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1370

And Peter opened his mouth , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1371

and said , Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1372

but in every nation he that feareth him , and worketh righteousness , is
acceptable to him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1373

The word which he sent unto the children of Israel , preaching good
tidings of peace by Jesus Christ <paren> he is Lord of all <$$paren> -
that saying ye yourselves know , which was published throughout all
Judaea , beginning from Galilee , after the baptism which John preached
; <font> even <$$font> Jesus of Nazareth , how that God anointed him
with the Holy Ghost and with power : who went about doing good , and
healing all that were oppressed of the devil ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1374

for God was with him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1375

And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of
the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom also they slew , hanging him on a
tree . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,20A.1376

<P_10,40A>

Him God raised up the third day , ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,40A.1378

and gave him to be made manifest , not to all the people , but unto
witnesses that were chosen before of God , <font> even <$$font> to us ,
who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,40A.1379

And he charged us to preach unto the people , and to testify that this
is he which is ordained of God <font> to be <$$font> the Judge of quick
and dead . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,40A.1380

To him bear all the prophets witness , that through his name every one
that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,40A.1381

While Peter yet spake these words , the Holy Ghost fell on all them
which heard the word . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,40A.1382

And they of the circumcision which believed were amazed , as many as
came with Peter , because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the
gift of the Holy Ghost . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,40A.1383

For they heard them speak with tongues , and magnify God .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,40A.1384

Then answered Peter , Can any man forbid the water , that these should
not be baptized , which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,40A.1385

And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,40A.1386

Then prayed they him to tarry certain days . ERV-NEW-1881-2,10,40A.1387

<P_11,1A>

Now the apostles and the brethren that were in Judaea heard that the
Gentiles also had received the word of God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1389

And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem , they that were of the
circumcision contended with him , saying , Thou wentest in to men
uncircumcised , ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1390

and didst eat with them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1391

But Peter began , ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1392

and expounded <font> the matter <$$font> unto them in order , saying , I
was in the city of Joppa praying : ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1393

and in a trance I saw a vision , a certain vessel descending , as it
were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1394

and it came even unto me : upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes
, I considered , and saw the four-footed beasts of the earth and wild
beasts and creeping things and fowls of the heaven .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1395

And I heard also a voice saying unto me , Rise , Peter ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1396

kill and eat . ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1397

But I said , Not so , Lord : ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1398

for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1399

But a voice answered the second time out of heaven , What God hath
cleansed , make not thou common . ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1400

And this was done thrice : ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1401

and all were drawn up again into heaven . ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1402

And behold , forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were
, having been sent from Caesarea unto me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1403

And the Spirit bade me go with them , making no distinction .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1404

And these six brethren also accompanied me ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1405

and we entered into the man's house : ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1406

and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house , and
saying , Send to Joppa , ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1407

and fetch Simon , whose surname is Peter ; who shall speak unto thee
words , whereby thou shalt be saved , thou and all thy house .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1408

And as I began to speak , the Holy Ghost fell on them , even as on us at
the beginning . ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1409

And I remembered the word of the Lord , how that he said , John indeed
baptized with water ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1410

but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1411

If then God gave unto them the like gift as <font> he did <$$font> also
unto us , when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I , that I
could withstand God ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1412

And when they heard these things , they held their peace ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1413

and glorified God , saying , Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted
repentance unto life . ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1414

They therefore that were scattered abroad upon the tribulation that
arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia , and Cyprus , and
Antioch , speaking the word to none save only to Jews .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,1A.1415

<P_11,20A>

But there were some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , who , when they
were come to Antioch , spake unto the Greeks also , preaching the Lord
Jesus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1417

And the hand of the Lord was with them : ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1418

and a great number that believed turned unto the Lord .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1419

And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was
in Jerusalem : ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1420

and they sent forth Barnabas as far as Antioch : who , when he was come
, and had seen the grace of God , was glad ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1421

and he exhorted them all , that with purpose of heart they would cleave
unto the Lord : ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1422

for he was a good man , and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1423

and much people was added unto the Lord . ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1424

And he went forth to Tarsus to seek for Saul :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1425

and when he had found him , he brought him unto Antioch .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1426

And it came to pass , that even for a whole year they were gathered
together with the church , and taught much people ; and that the
disciples were called Christians first in Antioch .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1427

Now in these days there came down prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1428

And there stood up one of them named Agabus , ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1429

and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all
the world : which came to pass in the days of Claudius .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1430

And the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to
send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judaea : which also they did
, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,11,20A.1431

<P_12,1A>

Now about that time Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict
certain of the church . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1433

And he killed James the brother of John with the sword .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1434

And when he saw that it pleased the Jews , he proceeded to seize Peter
also . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1435

And <font> those <$$font> were the days of unleavened bread .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1436

And when he had taken him , he put him in prison ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1437

and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him ;
intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1438

Peter therefore was kept in the prison : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1439

but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1440

And when Herod was about to bring him forth , the same night Peter was
sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1441

and guards before the door kept the prison . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1442

And behold , an angel of the Lord stood by him ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1443

and a light shined in the cell : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1444

and he smote Peter on the side , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1445

and awoke him , saying , Rise up quickly . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1446

And his chains fell off from his hands . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1447

And the angel said unto him , Gird thyself , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1448

and bind on thy sandals . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1449

And he did so . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1450

And he saith unto him , Cast thy garment about thee ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1451

and follow me . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1452

And he went out , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1453

and followed ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1454

and he wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1455

but thought he saw a vision . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1456

And when they were past the first and the second ward , they came unto
the iron gate that leadeth into the city ; which opened to them of its
own accord : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1457

and they went out , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1458

and passed on through one street ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1459

and straightway the angel departed from him . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1460

And when Peter was come to himself , he said , Now I know of a truth ,
that the Lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand
of Herod , and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1461

And when he had considered <font> the thing , <$$font> he came to the
house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark ; where many
were gathered together and were praying . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1462

And when he knocked at the door of the gate , a maid came to answer ,
named Rhoda . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1463

And when she knew Peter's voice , she opened not the gate for joy ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1464

but ran in , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1465

and told that Peter stood before the gate . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1466

And they said unto her , Thou art mad . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1467

But she confidently affirmed that it was even so .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1468

And they said , It is his angel . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1469

But Peter continued knocking : ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1470

and when they had opened , they saw him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1471

and were amazed . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1472

But he , beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace ,
declared unto them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1473

And he said , Tell these things unto James , and to the brethren .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1474

And he departed , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1475

and went to another place . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1476

Now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers ,
what was become of Peter . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1477

And when Herod had sought for him , and found him not , he examined the
guards , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1478

and commanded that they should be put to death .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1479

And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1480

and tarried there . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,1A.1481

<P_12,20A>

Now he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1483

and they came with one accord to him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1484

and , having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend , they
asked for peace , because their country was fed from the king's country
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1485

And upon a set day Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1486

and sat on the throne , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1487

and made an oration unto them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1488

And the people shouted , <font> saying , <$$font> The voice of a god ,
and not of a man . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1489

And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him , because he gave not God
the glory ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1490

and he was eaten of worms , ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1491

and gave up the ghost . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1492

But the word of God grew and multiplied . ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1493

And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem , when they had fulfilled
their ministration , taking with them John whose surname was Mark .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,12,20A.1494

<P_13,1A>

Now there were at Antioch , in the church that was <font> there ,
<$$font> prophets and teachers , Barnabas , and Symeon that was called
Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod
the tetrarch , and Saul . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1496

And as they ministered to the Lord , and fasted , the Holy Ghost said ,
Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1497

Then , when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them ,
they sent them away . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1498

So they , being sent forth by the Holy Ghost , went down to Seleucia ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1499

and from thence they sailed to Cyprus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1500

And when they were at Salamis , they proclaimed the word of God in the
synagogues of the Jews : ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1501

and they had also John as their attendant . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1502

And when they had gone through the whole island unto Paphos , they found
a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Bar-Jesus
; which was with the proconsul , Sergius Paulus , a man of understanding
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1503

The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1504

and sought to hear the word of God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1505

But Elymas the sorcerer <paren> for so is his name by interpretation
<$$paren> withstood them , seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the
faith . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1506

But Saul , who is also <font> called <$$font> Paul , filled with the
Holy Ghost , fastened his eyes on him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1507

and said , O full of all guile and all villany , thou son of the devil ,
thou enemy of all righteousness , wilt thou not cease to pervert the
right ways of the Lord ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1508

And now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon thee ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1509

and thou shalt be blind , not seeing the sun for a season .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1510

And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1511

and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1512

Then the proconsul , when he saw what was done , believed , being
astonished at the teaching of the Lord . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1513

Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1514

and came to Perga in Pamphylia : ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1515

and John departed from them ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1516

and returned to Jerusalem . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1517

But they , passing through from Perga , came to Antioch of Pisidia ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1518

and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1519

and sat down . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1520

And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the
synagogue sent unto them , saying , Brethren , if ye have any word of
exhortation for the people , say on . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1521

And Paul stood up , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1522

and beckoning with the hand said , Men of Israel , and ye that fear God
, hearken . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1523

The God of this people Israel chose our fathers ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1524

and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1525

and with a high arm led he them forth out of it .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1526

And for about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the
wilderness . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1527

And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan , he gave
<font> them <$$font> their land for an inheritance , for about
four_hundred_and_fifty years : ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,1A.1528

<P_13,20A>

and after these things he gave <font> them <$$font> judges until Samuel
the prophet . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1530

And afterward they asked for a king : ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1531

and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish , a man of the tribe of
Benjamin , for the space of forty years . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1532

And when he had removed him , he raised up David to be their king ; to
whom also he bare witness , and said , I have found David the son of
Jesse , a man after my heart , who shall do all my will .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1533

Of this man's seed hath God according to promise brought unto Israel a
Saviour , Jesus ; when John had first preached before his coming the
baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1534

And as John was fulfilling his course , he said , What suppose ye that I
am ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1535

I am not <font> he . <$$font> ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1536

But behold , there cometh one after me , the shoes of whose feet I am
not worthy to unloose . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1537

Brethren , children of the stock of Abraham , and those among you that
fear God , to us is the word of this salvation sent forth .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1538

For they that dwell in Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they knew
him not , nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath ,
fulfilled <font> them <$$font> by condemning <font> him . <$$font>
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1539

And though they found no cause of death <font> in him , <$$font> yet
asked they of Pilate that he should be slain .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1540

And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him , they
took him down from the tree , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1541

and laid him in a tomb . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1542

But God raised him from the dead : ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1543

and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee
to Jerusalem , who are now his witnesses unto the people .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1544

And we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers , how
that God hath fulfilled the same unto our children , in that he raised
up Jesus ; as also it is written in the second psalm , Thou art my Son ,
this day have I begotten thee . And as concerning that he raised him up
from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he hath spoken on
this wise , I will give you the holy and sure <font> blessings <$$font>
of David . Because he saith also in another <font> psalm , <$$font>
Thou wilt not give thy Holy One to see corruption .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1545

For David , after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God
, fell on sleep , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1546

and was laid unto his fathers , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1547

and saw corruption : ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1548

but he whom God raised up saw no corruption .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1549

Be it known unto you therefore , brethren , that through this man is
proclaimed unto you remission of sins : ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1550

and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things , from
which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,20A.1551

<P_13,40A>

Beware therefore , lest that come upon <font> you , <$$font> which is
spoken in the prophets ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1553

Behold , ye despisers , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1554

and wonder , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1555

and perish ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1556

For I work a work in your days , A work which ye shall in no wise
believe , if one declare it unto you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1557

And as they went out , they besought that these words might be spoken to
them the next sabbath . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1558

Now when the synagogue broke up , many of the Jews and of the devout
proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas : who , speaking to them , urged
them to continue in the grace of God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1559

And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear
the word of God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1560

But when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with jealousy ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1561

and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1562

and blasphemed . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1563

And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1564

and said , It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken
to you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1565

Seeing ye thrust it from you , and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal
life , lo , we turn to the Gentiles . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1566

For so hath the Lord commanded us , <font> saying , <$$font> I have set
thee for a light of the Gentiles , That thou shouldest be for salvation
unto the uttermost part of the earth . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1567

And as the Gentiles heard this , they were glad ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1568

and glorified the word of God ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1569

and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1570

And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1571

But the Jews urged on the devout women of honourable estate , and the
chief men of the city , ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1572

and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1573

and cast them out of their borders . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1574

But they shook off the dust of their feet against them ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1575

and came unto Iconium . ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1576

And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,13,40A.1577

<P_14,1A>

And it came to pass in Iconium , that they entered together into the
synagogue of the Jews , and so spake , that a great multitude both of
Jews and of Greeks believed . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1579

But the Jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles
, ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1580

and made them evil affected against the brethren .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1581

Long time therefore they tarried <font> there <$$font> speaking boldly
in the Lord , which bare witness unto the word of his grace , granting
signs and wonders to be done by their hands . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1582

But the multitude of the city was divided ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1583

and part held with the Jews , and part with the apostles .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1584

And when there was made an onset both of the Gentiles and of the Jews
with their rulers , to entreat them shamefully , and to stone them ,
they became aware of it , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1585

and fled unto the cities of Lycaonia , Lystra and Derbe , and the region
round about : ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1586

and there they preached the gospel . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1587

And at Lystra there sat a certain man , impotent in his feet , a cripple
from his mother's womb , who never had walked .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1588

The same heard Paul speaking : who , fastening his eyes upon him , and
seeing that he had faith to be made whole , said with a loud voice ,
Stand upright on thy feet . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1589

And he leaped up ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1590

and walked . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1591

And when the multitudes saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their
voice , saying in the speech of Lycaonia , The gods are come down to us
in the likeness of men . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1592

And they called Barnabas , Jupiter ; and Paul , Mercury , because he was
the chief speaker . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1593

And the priest of Jupiter whose <font> temple <$$font> was before the
city , brought oxen and garlands unto the gates ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1594

and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1595

But when the apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of it , they rent
their garments , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1596

and sprang forth among the multitude , crying out and saying , Sirs ,
why do ye these things ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1597

We also are men of like passions with you , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1598

and bring you good tidings , that ye should turn from these vain things
unto the living God , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea ,
and all that in them is ; who in the generations gone by suffered all
the nations to walk in their own ways . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1599

And yet he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and
gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons , filling your hearts
with food and gladness . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1600

And with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing
sacrifice unto them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1601

But there came Jews thither from Antioch and Iconium :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1602

and having persuaded the multitudes , they stoned Paul ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1603

and dragged him out of the city , supposing that he was dead .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,1A.1604

<P_14,20A>

But as the disciples stood round about him , he rose up ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20A.1606

and entered into the city : ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20A.1607

and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe .

And when they had preached the gospel to that city , and had made many
disciples , they returned to Lystra , and to Iconium , and to Antioch ,
confirming the souls of the disciples , exhorting them to continue in
the faith , and that through many tribulations we must enter into the
kingdom of God . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20A.1609

And when they had appointed for them elders in every church , and had
prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they had
believed . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20A.1610

And they passed through Pisidia , ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20A.1611

and came to Pamphylia . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20A.1612

And when they had spoken the word in Perga , they went down to Attalia ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20A.1613

and thence they sailed to Antioch , from whence they had been committed
to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20A.1614

And when , they were come , and had gathered the church together , they
rehearsed all things that God had done with them , and how that he had
opened a door of faith unto the Gentiles . ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20A.1615

And they tarried no little time with the disciples .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,14,20A.1616

<P_15,1A>

And certain men came down from Judaea , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1618

and taught the brethren , <font> saying , <$$font> Except ye be
circumcised after the custom of Moses , ye can@ @not be saved .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1619

And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with
them , <font> the brethren <$$font> appointed that Paul and Barnabas ,
and certain other of them , should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles
and elders about this question . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1620

They therefore , being brought on their way by the church , passed
through both Phoenicia and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the
Gentiles : ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1621

and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1622

And when they were come to Jerusalem , they were received of the church
and the apostles and the elders , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1623

and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1624

But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed ,
saying , It is needful to circumcise them , and to charge them to keep
the law of Moses . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1625

And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of
this matter . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1626

And when there had been much questioning , Peter rose up ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1627

and said unto them , Brethren , ye know how that a good while ago God
made choice among you , that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the
word of the gospel , and believe . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1628

And God , which knoweth the heart , bare them witness , giving them the
Holy Ghost , even as he did unto us ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1629

and he made no distinction between us and them , cleansing their hearts
by faith . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1630

Now therefore why tempt ye God , that ye should put a yoke upon the neck
of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1631

But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord
Jesus , in like manner as they . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1632

And all the multitude kept silence ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1633

and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and
wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1634

And after they had held their peace , James answered , saying , Brethren
, hearken unto me : ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1635

Symeon hath rehearsed how first God did visit the Gentiles , to take out
of them a people for his name . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1636

And to this agree the words of the prophets ; as it is written , After
these things I will return , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1637

And I will build again the tabernacle of David , which is fallen ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1638

And I will build again the ruins thereof , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,1A.1639

And I will set it up : That the residue of men may seek after the Lord ,
And all the Gentiles , upon whom my name is called , Saith the Lord ,
who maketh these things known from the beginning of the world .
Wherefore my judgement is , that we trouble not them which from among
the Gentiles turn to God ; <P_15,20A> but that we write unto them , that
they abstain from the pollutions of idols , and from fornication , and
from what is strangled , and from blood . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1640

For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach
him , being read in the synagogues every sabbath .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1641

Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders , with the whole
church , to choose men out of their company , and send them to Antioch
with Paul and Barnabas ; <font> namely , <$$font> Judas called Barsabbas
, and Silas , chief men among the brethren : ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1642

and they wrote <font> thus <$$font> by them , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1643

The apostles and the elder brethren unto the brethren which are of the
Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia , greeting :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1644

Forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have
troubled you with words , subverting your souls ; to whom we gave no
commandment ; it seemed good unto us , having come to one accord , to
choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul
, men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1645

We have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who themselves also shall tell
you the same things by word of mouth . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1646

For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost , and to us , to lay upon you no
greater burden than these necessary things ; that ye abstain from things
sacrificed to idols , and from blood , and from things strangled , and
from fornication ; from which if ye keep yourselves , it shall be well
with you . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1647

Fare ye well . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1648

So they , when they were dismissed , came down to Antioch ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1649

and having gathered the multitude together , they delivered the epistle
, ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1650

And when they had read it , they rejoiced for the consolation .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1651

And Judas and Silas , being themselves also prophets , exhorted the
brethren with many words , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1652

and confirmed them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1653

And after they had spent some time <font> there , <$$font> they were
dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1654

But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch , teaching and preaching the
word of the Lord , with many others also . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1655

And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas , Let us return now and
visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the
Lord , <font> and see <$$font> how they fare .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1656

And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also , who was called
Mark . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1657

But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them
from Pamphylia , and went not with them to the work .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1658

And there arose a sharp contention , so that they parted asunder one
from the other , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1659

and Barnabas took Mark with him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1660

and sailed away unto Cyprus ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,20A.1661

<P_15,40A>

but Paul chose Silas , ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,40A.1663

and went forth , being commended by the brethren to the grace of the
Lord . ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,40A.1664

And he went through Syria and Cilicia , confirming the churches .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,15,40A.1665

<P_16,1A>

And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1667

and behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timothy , the son of a
Jewess which believed ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1668

but his father was a Greek . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1669

The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and
Iconium . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1670

Him would Paul have to go forth with him ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1671

and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those
parts : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1672

for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1673

And as they went on their way through the cities , they delivered them
the decrees for to keep , which had been ordained of the apostles and
elders that were at Jerusalem . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1674

So the churches were strengthened in the faith ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1675

and increased in number daily . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1676

And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia , having been
forbidden of the Holy Ghost to speak the word in Asia ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1677

and when they were come over against Mysia , they assayed to go into
Bithynia ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1678

and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1679

and passing by Mysia , they came down to Troas .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1680

And a vision appeared to Paul in the night ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1681

There was a man of Macedonia standing , beseeching him , and saying ,
Come over into Macedonia , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1682

and help us . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1683

And when he had seen the vision , straightway we sought to go forth into
Macedonia , concluding that God had called us for to preach the gospel
unto them . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1684

Setting sail therefore from Troas , we made a straight course to
Samothrace , and the day following to Neapolis ; and from thence to
Philippi , which is a city of Macedonia , the first of the district , a
<font> Roman <$$font> colony : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1685

and we were in this city tarrying certain days .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1686

And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side ,
where we supposed there was a place of prayer ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1687

and we sat down , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1688

and spake unto the women which were come together .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1689

And a certain woman named Lydia , a seller of purple , of the city of
Thyatira , one that worshipped God , heard us ; whose heart the Lord
opened , to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1690

And when she was baptized , and her household , she besought us , saying
, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my house ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1691

and abide <font> there . <$$font> ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1692

And she constrained us . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1693

And it came to pass , as we were going to the place of prayer , that a
certain maid having a spirit of divination met us , which brought her
masters much gain by soothsaying . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1694

The same following after Paul and us cried out , saying , These men are
servants of the Most High God , which proclaim unto you the way of
salvation . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1695

And this she did for many days . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1696

But Paul , being sore troubled , turned ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1697

and said to the spirit , I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to
come out of her . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1698

And it came out that very hour . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1699

But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they
laid hold on Paul and Silas , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1700

and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,1A.1701

<P_16,20A>

and when they had brought them unto the magistrates , they said , These
men , being Jews , do exceedingly trouble our city , and set forth
customs which it is not lawful for us to receive , or to observe , being
Romans . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1703

And the multitude rose up together against them :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1704

and the magistrates rent their garments off them ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1705

and commanded to beat them with rods . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1706

And when they had laid many stripes upon them , they cast them into
prison , charging the jailor to keep them safely : who , having received
such a charge , cast them into the inner prison , and made their feet
fast in the stocks . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1707

But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto
God , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1708

and the prisoners were listening to them ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1709

and suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of
the prison-house were shaken : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1710

and immediately all the doors were opened ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1711

and every one's bands were loosed . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1712

And the jailor being roused out of sleep , and seeing the prison doors
open , drew his sword , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1713

and was to kill himself , supposing that the prisoners had escaped .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1714

But Paul cried with a loud voice , saying , Do thyself no harm :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1715

for we are all here . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1716

And he called for lights , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1717

and sprang in , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1718

and , trembling for fear , fell down before Paul and Silas ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1719

and brought them out , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1720

and said , Sirs , what must I do to be saved ?
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1721

And they said , Believe on the Lord Jesus , and thou shalt be saved ,
thou and thy house . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1722

And they spake the word of the Lord unto him , with all that were in his
house . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1723

And he took them the same hour of the night , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1724

and washed their stripes ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1725

and was baptized , he and all his , immediately .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1726

And he brought them up into his house , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1727

and set meat before them , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1728

and rejoiced greatly , with all his house , having believed in God .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1729

But when it was day , the magistrates sent the serjeants , saying , Let
those men go . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1730

And the jailor reported the words to Paul , <font> saying , <$$font> The
magistrates have sent to let you go : ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1731

now therefore come forth , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1732

and go in peace . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1733

But Paul said unto them , They have beaten us publicly , uncondemned ,
men that are Romans , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1734

and have cast us into prison ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1735

and do they now cast us out privily ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1736

nay verily ; but let them come themselves and bring us out .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1737

And the serjeants reported these words unto the magistrates :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1738

and they feared , when they heard that they were Romans ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1739

and they came ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1740

and besought them ; ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1741

and when they had brought them out , they asked them to go away from the
city . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,20A.1742

<P_16,40A>

And they went out of the prison , ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,40A.1744

and entered into <font> the house of <$$font> Lydia ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,40A.1745

and when they had seen the brethren , they comforted them ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,40A.1746

and departed . ERV-NEW-1881-2,16,40A.1747

<P_17,1A>

Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to
Thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the Jews :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1749

and Paul , as his custom was , went in unto them ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1750

and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures ,
opening and alleging , that it behoved the Christ to suffer , and to
rise again from the dead ; and that this Jesus , whom , <font> said he ,
<$$font> I proclaim unto you , is the Christ .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1751

And some of them were persuaded , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1752

and consorted with Paul and Silas ; and of the devout Greeks a great
multitude , and of the chief women not a few .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1753

But the Jews , being moved with jealousy , took unto them certain vile
fellows of the rabble , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1754

and gathering a crowd , set the city on an uproar , ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1755

and assaulting the house of Jason , they sought to bring them forth to
the people . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1756

And when they found them not , they dragged Jason and certain brethren
before the rulers of the city , crying , These that have turned the
world upside down are come hither also ; whom Jason hath received :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1757

and these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there
is another king , <font> one <$$font> Jesus . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1758

And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city , when they
heard these things . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1759

And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest , they let them
go . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1760

And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto
Beroea : who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the
Jews . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1761

Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they
received the word with all readiness of mind , examining the scriptures
daily , whether these things were so . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1762

Many of them therefore believed ; also of the Greek women of honourable
estate , and of men , not a few . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1763

But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was
proclaimed of Paul at Beroea also , they came thither likewise ,
stirring up and troubling the multitudes . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1764

And then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the
sea : ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1765

and Silas and Timothy abode there still . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1766

But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1767

and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that they should come
to him with all speed , they departed . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1768

Now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was provoked
within him , as he beheld the city full of idols .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1769

So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons ,
and in the marketplace every day with them that met with him .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1770

And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him
. ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1771

And some said , What would this babbler say ? other some , He seemeth
to be a setter forth of strange gods : because he preached Jesus and the
resurrection . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1772

And they took hold of him , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1773

and brought him unto the Areopagus , saying , May we know what this new
teaching is , which is spoken by thee ? ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,1A.1774

<P_17,20A>

For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears :
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1776

we would know therefore what these things mean .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1777

<paren> Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent
their time in nothing else , but either to tell or to hear some new
thing . <$$paren> ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1778

And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1779

and said , Ye men of Athens , in all things I perceive that ye are
somewhat Superstitious . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1780

For as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I
found also an altar with this inscription , TO AN UNKNOWN GOD .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1781

What therefore ye worship in ignorance , this set I forth unto you .
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1782

The God that made the world and all things therein , he , being Lord of
heaven and earth , dwelleth not in temples made with hands ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1783

neither is he served by men's hands , as though he needed any thing ,
seeing he himself giveth to all life , and breath , and all things ;
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1784

and he made of one every nation of men for to dwell on all the face of
the earth , having determined <font> their <$$font> appointed seasons ,
and the bounds of their habitation ; that they should seek God , if
haply they might feel after him , and find him , though he is not far
from each one of us : ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1785

for in him we live , and move , ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1786

and have our being ; as certain even of your own poets have said ,
ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1787

For we are also his offspring . ERV-NEW-1881-2,17,20A.1788

Being then the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Godhead
