And Abel , he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat
thereof . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.11

And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.12

but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.13

And Cain was very wroth , ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.14

and his countenance fell . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.15

And the Lord said unto Cain , Why art thou wroth ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.16

and why is thy countenance fallen ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.17

If thou doest well , shalt thou not be accepted ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.18

and if thou doest not well , sin coucheth at the door :

and unto thee shall be his desire , ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.20

and thou shalt rule over him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.21

against Abel his brother , and slew him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.23

And the Lord said unto Cain , Where is Abel thy brother ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.24

And he said , I know not : ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.25

am I my brother's keeper ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.26

And he said , What hast thou done ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.27

the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.28

And now cursed art thou from the ground , which hath opened her mouth to
receive thy brother's blood from thy hand ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.29

when thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee
her strength ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.30

a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.31

And Cain said unto the Lord , My punishment is greater than I can bear .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.32

Behold , thou has driven me out this day from the face of the ground ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.33

and from thy face shall I be hid ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.34

and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.35

and it shall come to pass , that whosoever findeth me shall slay me .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.36

And the Lord said unto him , Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain ,
vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.37

And the Lord appointed a sign for Cain , lest any finding him should
smite him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.38

And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord , ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.39

ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.58

Ye wives of Lamech , hearken unto my speech : ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.59

For I have slain a man for wounding me , And a young man for bruising me
: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.60

<P_11,1G> And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.170

And it came to pass , as they journeyed east , that they found a plain
in the land of Shinar ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.171

and they dwelt there . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.172

And they said one to another , Go to , ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.173

let us make brick , and burn them thoroughly {TEXT:throughly} .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.174

And they had brick for stone , ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.175

and slime had they for mortar . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.176

And they said , Go to , ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.177

let us build us a city , and a tower , whose top <font> may reach
<$$font> unto heaven , ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.178

and let us make us a name ; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of
the whole earth . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.179

And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower , which the
children of men builded . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.180

And the Lord said , Behold , they are one people ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.181

and they have all one language ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.182

and this is what they begin to do : ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.183

and now nothing will be withholden from them , which they purpose to do
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.184

Go to , ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.185

let us go down , and there confound their language , that they may not
understand one another's speech . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.186

So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the
earth : ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.187

and they left off to build the city . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.188

Therefore was the name of it called Babel ; because the Lord did there
confound the language of all the earth : ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.189

and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all
the earth . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.190

and begat sons and daughters . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.223

And Terah lived seventy years , ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.224

and begat Abram , Nahor , and Haran . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.225

Now these are the generations of Terah . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.226

Terah begat Abram , Nahor , and Haran ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.227

and Haran begat Lot . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.228

And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his
nativity , in Ur of the Chaldees . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.229

And Abram and Nahor took them wives : ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.230

the name of Abram's wife was Sarai ; and the name of Nahor's wife ,
Milcah , the daughter of Haran , the father of Milcah , and the father
of Iscah . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.231

And Sarai was barren ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.232

she had no child . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.233

And Terah took Abram his son , and Lot the son of Haran , his son's son
, and Sarai his daughter in law , his son Abram@ @'s wife ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.234

and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees , to go into the
land of Canaan ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.235

and they came unto Haran , ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.236

and dwelt there . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.237

And the days of Terah were two_hundred_and_five years :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.238

and Terah died in Haran . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.239

<P_15,1G> After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a
vision , saying , Fear not , Abram : ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.240

I am thy shield , <font> and <$$font> thy exceeding great reward .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.241

And Abram said , O Lord God , what wilt thou give me , seeing I go
childless , and he that shall be possessor of my house is Dammesek
Eliezer ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.242

And Abram said , Behold , to me thou hast given no seed :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.243

and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.244

And , behold , the word of the Lord came unto him , saying , This man
shall not be thine heir ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.245

but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.246

And he brought him forth abroad , ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.247

and said , Look now toward heaven , ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.248

and tell the stars , if thou be able to tell them :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.249

and he said unto him , So shall thy seed be . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.250

And he believed in the Lord ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.251

and he counted it to him for righteousness . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.252

And he said unto him , I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the
Chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.253

And he said , O Lord God , whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it
? ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.254

And he said unto him , Take me an heifer of three years old , and a
she-goat of three years old , and a ram of three years old , and a
turtledove , and a young pigeon . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.255

And he took him all these , ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.256

and divided them in the midst , ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.257

and laid each half over against the other : ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.258

but the birds divided he not . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.259

And the birds of prey came down upon the carcases ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.260

and Abram drove them away . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.261

And when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.262

and , lo , an horror of great darkness fell upon him .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.263

And he said unto Abram , Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a
stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.264

and they shall afflict them four_hundred years ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.265

and also that nation , whom they shall serve , will I judge :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.266

and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.267

But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.268

thou shalt be buried in a good old age . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.269

And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.270

for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.271

And it came to pass , that , when the sun went down , and it was dark ,
behold a smoking furnace , and a flaming torch that passed between these
pieces . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.272

In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram , saying , Unto thy seed
have I given this land , from the river of Egypt unto the great river ,
the river Euphrates : the Kenite , and the Kenizzite , and the Kadmonite
, <P_15,20G> and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Rephaim , and
the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Girgashite , and the Jebusite
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20G.273

<P_16,1G> Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.274

and she had an handmaid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.275

And Sarai said unto Abram , Behold now , the Lord hath restrained me
from bearing ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.276

go in , I pray thee , unto my handmaid ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.277

it may be that I shall obtain children by her .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.278

And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai . ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.279

And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar the Egyptian , her handmaid , after
Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.280

and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.281

And he went in unto Hagar , ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.282

and she conceived : ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.283

and when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in
her eyes . ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.284

And Sarai said unto Abram , My wrong be upon thee :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.285

I gave my handmaid into thy bosom ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.286

and when she saw that she had conceived , I was despised in her eyes :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.287

the Lord judge between me and thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.288

But Abram said unto Sarai , Behold , thy maid is in thy hand :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.289

do to her that which is good in thine eyes . ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.290

And Sarai dealt hardly with her , ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.291

and she fled from her face . ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.292

And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the
wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.293

And he said , Hagar , Sarai's handmaid , whence camest thou ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.294

and whither goest thou ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.295

And she said , I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.296

And the angel of the Lord said unto her , Return to thy mistress ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.297

and submit thyself under her hands . ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.298

And the angel of the Lord said unto her , I will greatly multiply thy
seed , that it shall not be numbered for multitude .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.299

And the angel of the Lord said unto her , Behold , thou art with child ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.300

and shalt bear a son ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.301

and thou shalt call his name Ishmael , because the Lord hath heard thy
affliction . ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.302

And he shall be <font> as <$$font> a wild-ass among men ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.303

his hand <font> shall be <$$font> against every man , and every man's
hand against him ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.304

and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.305

And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her , Thou art a God
that seeth : ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.306

for she said , Have I even here looked after him that seeth me ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.307

Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.308

behold , it is between Kadesh and Bered . ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.309

And Hagar bare Abram a son : ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.310

and Abram called the name of his son , which Hagar bare , Ishmael .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.311

And Abram was fourscore_and_six years old , when Hagar bare Ishmael to
Abram . ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.312

<P_17,1G> And when Abram was ninety years old and nine , the Lord
appeared to Abram , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.313

and said unto him , I am God Almighty ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.314

walk before me , and be thou perfect . And I will make my covenant
between me and thee , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.315

and will multiply thee exceedingly . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.316

And Abram fell on his face : ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.317

and God talked with him , saying , As for me , behold , my covenant is
with thee , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.318

and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.319

Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.320

but thy name shall be Abraham ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.321

for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.322

And I will make thee exceeding fruitful , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.323

and I will make nations of thee , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.324

and kings shall come out of thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.325

And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after
thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant , to be a
God unto thee and to thy seed after thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.326

And I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land of thy
sojournings , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.327

and I will be their God . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.328

And God said unto Abraham , And as for thee , thou shalt keep my
covenant , thou , and thy seed after thee throughout their generations .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.329

This is my covenant , which ye shall keep , between me and you and thy
seed after thee ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.330

every male among you shall be circumcised . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.331

And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.332

and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.333

And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you , every
male throughout your generations , he that is born in the house , or
bought with money of any stranger , which is not of thy seed .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.334

He that is born in thy house , and he that is bought with thy money ,
must needs be circumcised : ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.335

and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.336

And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his
foreskin , that soul shall be cut off from his people ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.337

he hath broken my covenant . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.338

And God said unto Abraham , As for Sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call
her name Sarai , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.339

but Sarah shall her name be . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.340

And I will bless her , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.341

and moreover I will give thee a son of her : ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.342

yea , I will bless her , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.343

and she shall be <font> a mother of <$$font> nations ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.344

kings of peoples shall be of her . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.345

Then Abraham fell upon his face , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.346

and laughed , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.347

and said in his heart , Shall a child be born unto him that is
an_hundred years old ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.348

and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.349

And Abraham said unto God , Oh that Ishmael might live before thee !
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.350

And God said , Nay , but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.351

and thou shalt call his name Isaac : ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.352

and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant
for his seed after him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.353

<P_17,20G> And as for Ishmael , I have heard thee :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.354

behold , I have blessed him , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.355

and will make him fruitful , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.356

and will multiply him exceedingly ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.357

twelve princes shall he beget , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.358

and I will make him a great nation . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.359

But my covenant will I establish with Isaac , which Sarah shall bear
unto thee at this set time in the next year . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.360

And he left off talking with him , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.361

and God went up from Abraham . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.362

And Abraham took Ishmael his son , and all that were born in his house ,
and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of
Abraham's house , ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.363

and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day , as God
had said unto him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.364

And Abraham was ninety years old and nine , when he was circumcised in
the flesh of his foreskin . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.365

And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old , when he was circumcised in
the flesh of his foreskin . ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.366

In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised , and Ishmael his son .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.367

And all the men of his house , those born in the house , and those
bought with money of the stranger , were circumcised with him .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.368

<P_18,1G> And the Lord appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre , as he
sat in the tent door in the heat of the day ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.369

and he lift up his eyes ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.370

and looked , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.371

and , lo , three men stood over against him : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.372

and when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.373

and bowed himself to the earth , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.374

and said , My lord , if now I have found favour in thy sight , pass not
away , I pray thee , from thy servant : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.375

let now a little water be fetched , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.376

and wash your feet , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.377

and rest yourselves under the tree : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.378

and I will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye your heart ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.379

after that ye shall pass on : forasmuch as ye are come to your servant .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.380

And they said , So do , as thou hast said . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.381

And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.382

and said , Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.383

knead it , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.384

and make cakes . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.385

And Abraham ran unto the herd , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.386

and fetched a calf tender and good , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.387

and gave it unto the servant ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.388

and he hasted to dress it . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.389

And he took butter , and milk , and the calf which he had dressed ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.390

and set it before them ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.391

and he stood by them under the tree , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.392

and they did eat . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.393

And they said unto him , Where is Sarah thy wife ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.394

And he said , Behold , in the tent . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.395

And he said , I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh
round ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.396

and , lo , Sarah thy wife shall have a son . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.397

And Sarah heard in the tent door , which was behind him .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.398

Now Abraham and Sarah were old , <font> and <$$font> well stricken in
age ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.399

it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.400

And Sarah laughed within herself , saying , After I am waxed old shall I
have pleasure , my lord being old also ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.401

And the Lord said unto Abraham , Wherefore did Sarah laugh , saying ,
Shall I of a surety bear a child , which am old ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.402

Is any thing too hard for the Lord ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.403

At the set time I will return unto thee , when the season cometh round ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.404

and Sarah shall have a son . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.405

Then Sarah denied , saying , I laughed not ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.406

for she was afraid . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.407

And he said , Nay ; but thou didst laugh . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.408

And the men rose up from thence , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.409

and looked toward Sodom : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.410

and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.411

And the Lord said , Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do ; seeing
that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the
nations of the earth shall be blessed in him ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.412

For I have known him , to the end that he may command his children and
his household after him , that they may keep the way of the Lord , to do
justice and judgement ; to the end that the Lord may bring upon Abraham
that which he hath spoken of him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.413

<P_18,20G> And the Lord said , Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
great , and because their sin is very grievous ; I will go down now ,
and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it ,
which is come unto me ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.414

and if not , I will know . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.415

And the men turned from thence , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.416

and went toward Sodom : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.417

but Abraham stood yet before the Lord . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.418

And Abraham drew near , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.419

and said , Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.420

Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.421

wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that
are therein ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.422

That be far from thee to do after this manner , to slay the righteous
with the wicked , that so the righteous should be as the wicked ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.423

that be far from thee : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.424

shall not the Judge of all the earth do right ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.425

And the Lord said , If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city ,
then I will spare all the place for their sake .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.426

And Abraham answered ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.427

and said , Behold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord ,
which am but dust and ashes : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.428

peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.429

wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.430

And he said , I will not destroy it , if I find there forty_and_five .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.431

And he spake unto him yet again , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.432

and said , Peradventure there shall be forty found there .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.433

And he said , I will not do it for the forty@ @'s sake .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.434

And he said , Oh let not the Lord be angry , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.435

and I will speak : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.436

peradventure there shall thirty be found there .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.437

And he said , I will not do it , if I find thirty there .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.438

And he said , Behold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.439

peradventure there shall be twenty found there .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.440

And he said , I will not destroy it for the twenty@ @'s sake .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.441

And he said , Oh let not the Lord be angry , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.442

and I will speak yet but this once : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.443

peradventure ten shall be found there . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.444

And he said , I will not destroy it for the ten@ @'s sake .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.445

And the Lord went his way , as soon as he had left communing with
Abraham : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.446

and Abraham returned unto his place . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.447

<P_19,1G> And the two angels came to Sodom at even ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.448

and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.449

and Lot saw them , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.450

and rose up to meet them ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.451

and he bowed himself with his face to the earth ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.452

and he said , Behold now , my lords , turn aside , I pray you , into
your servant's house , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.453

and tarry all night , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.454

and wash your feet , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.455

and ye shall rise up early , and go on your way - .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.456

And they said , Nay ; but we will abide in the street all night .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.457

And he urged them greatly ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.458

and they turned in unto him , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.459

and entered into his house ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.460

and he made them a feast , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.461

and did bake unleavened bread , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.462

and they did eat . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.463

But before they lay down , the men of the city , <font> even <$$font>
the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both young and old , all
the people from every quarter ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.464

and they called unto Lot , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.465

and said unto him , Where are the men which came in to thee this night ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.466

bring them out unto us , that we may know them .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.467

And Lot went out unto them to the door , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.468

and shut the door after him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.469

And he said , I pray you , my brethren , do not so wickedly .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.470

Behold now , I have two daughters which have not known man ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.471

let me , I pray you , bring them out unto you , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.472

and do ye to them as is good in your eyes : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.473

only unto these men do nothing ; forasmuch as they are come under the
shadow of my roof . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.474

And they said , Stand back . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.475

And they said , This one fellow came in to sojourn ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.476

and he will needs be a judge : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.477

now will we deal worse with thee , than with them .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.478

And they pressed sore upon the man , even Lot , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.479

and drew near to break the door . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.480

But the men put forth their hand , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.481

and brought Lot into the house to them , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.482

and shut to the door . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.483

And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness
, both small and great : so that they wearied themselves to find the
door . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.484

And the men said unto Lot , Hast thou here any besides ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.485

son in law , and thy sons , and thy daughters , and whomsoever thou hast
in the city ; bring them out of the place : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.486

for we will destroy this place , because the cry of them is waxen great
before the Lord ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.487

and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.488

And Lot went out , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.489

and spake unto his sons in law , which married his daughters ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.490

and said , Up , get you out of this place ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.491

for the Lord will destroy the city . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.492

But he seemed unto his sons in law as one that mocked .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.493

And when the morning arose , then the angels hastened Lot , saying ,
Arise , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.494

take thy wife , and thy two daughters which are here ; lest thou be
consumed in the iniquity of the city . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.495

But he lingered ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.496

and the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife ,
and upon the hand of his two daughters ; the Lord being merciful unto
him : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.497

and they brought him forth , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.498

and set him without the city . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.499

And it came to pass , when they had brought them forth abroad , that he
said , Escape for thy life ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.500

look not behind thee , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.501

neither stay thou in all the Plain ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.502

escape to the mountain , lest thou be consumed .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.503

And Lot said unto them , Oh , not so , my lord :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.504

behold now , thy servant has found grace in thy sight ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.505

and thou hast magnified thy mercy , which thou hast shewed unto me in
saving my life ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.506

and I can@ @not escape to the mountain , lest evil overtake me , and I
die : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.507

<P_19,20G> behold now , this city is near to flee unto ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.508

and it is a little one : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.509

Oh , let me escape thither , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.510

<paren> is it not a little one ? <$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.511

and my soul shall live . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.512

And he said unto him , See , I have accepted thee concerning this thing
also , that I will not overthrow the city of which thou has spoken .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.513

Haste thee , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.514

escape thither ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.515

for I can@ @not do any thing till thou be come thither .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.516

Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.517

The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.518

Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire
from the Lord out of heaven ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.519

and he overthrew those cities , and all the Plain , and all the
inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.520

But his wife looked back from behind him , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.521

and she became a pillar of salt . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.522

And Abraham got {TEXT:gat} up early in the morning to the place where he
had stood before the Lord : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.523

and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the
Plain , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.524

and beheld , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.525

and , lo , the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.526

And it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the Plain , that
God remembered Abraham , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.527

and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the
cities in the which Lot dwelt . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.528

And Lot went up out of Zoar , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.529

and dwelt in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.530

for he feared to dwell in Zoar : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.531

and he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.532

And the firstborn said unto the younger , Our father is old ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.533

and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner
of all the earth : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.534

come , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.535

let us make our father drink wine , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.536

and we will lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.537

And they made their father drink wine that night :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.538

and the firstborn went in , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.539

and lay with her father ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.540

and he knew not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.541

And it came to pass on the morrow , that the firstborn said unto the
younger , Behold , I lay yesternight with my father :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.542

let us make him drink wine this night also ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.543

and go thou in , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.544

and lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.545

And they made their father drink wine that night also :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.546

and the younger arose , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.547

and lay with him ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.548

and he knew not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.549

Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.550

And the firstborn bare a son , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.551

and called his name Moab : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.552

the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.553

And the younger , she also bare a son , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.554

and called his name Ben-ammi : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.555

the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.556

<P_20,1G> And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South
, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.557

and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.558

and he sojourned in Gerar . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.559

And Abraham said of Sarah his wife , She is my sister :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.560

and Abimelech king of Gerar sent , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.561

and took Sarah . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.562

But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.563

and said to him , Behold , thou art but a dead man , because of the
woman which thou hast taken ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.564

for she is a man's wife . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.565

Now Abimelech had not come near her : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.566

and he said , Lord , wilt thou slay even a righteous nation ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.567

Said he not himself unto me , She is my sister ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.568

and she , even she herself said , He is my brother :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.569

in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done
this . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.570

And God said to him in the dream , Yea , I know that in the integrity of
thy heart thou hast done this , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.571

and I also withheld thee from sinning against me :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.572

therefore suffered I thee not to touch her . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.573

Now therefore restore the man's wife ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.574

for he is a prophet , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.575

and he shall pray for thee , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.576

and thou shalt live : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.577

and if thou restore her not , know thou that thou shalt surely die ,
thou , and all that are thine . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.578

And Abimelech rose early in the morning , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.579

and called all his servants , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.580

and told all these things in their ears : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.581

and the men were sore afraid . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.582

Then Abimelech called Abraham , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.583

and said unto him , What hast thou done unto us ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.584

and wherein have I sinned against thee , that thou hast brought on me
and on my kingdom a great sin ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.585

thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.586

And Abimelech said unto Abraham , What sawest thou , that thou hast done
this thing ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.587

And Abraham said , Because I thought , Surely the fear of God is not in
this place ; and they will slay me for my wife's sake .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.588

And moreover she is indeed my sister , the daughter of my father , but
not the daughter of my mother ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.589

and she became my wife : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.590

and it came to pass , when God caused me to wander from my father's
house , that I said unto her , This is thy kindness which thou shalt
shew unto me ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.591

at every place whither we shall come , say of me , He is my brother .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.592

And Abimelech took sheep and oxen , and menservants and womenservants ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.593

and gave them unto Abraham , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.594

and restored him Sarah his wife . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.595

And Abimelech said , Behold , my land is before thee :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.596

dwell where it pleaseth thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.597

And unto Sarah he said , Behold , I have given thy brother a_thousand
pieces of silver : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.598

behold , it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee
; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.599

and in respect of all thou art righted . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.600

And Abraham prayed unto God : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.601

and God healed Abimelech , and his wife , and his maidservants ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.602

and they bare children . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.603

For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech
, because of Sarah Abraham's wife . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.604

<P_21,1G> And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.605

and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.606

And Sarah conceived , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.607

and bare Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had
spoken to him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.608

And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him , whom
Sarah bare to him , Isaac . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.609

And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old , as
God had commanded him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.610

And Abraham was an_hundred years old , when his son Isaac was born unto
him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.611

And Sarah said , God hath made me to laugh ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.612

every one that heareth will laugh with me . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.613

And she said , Who would have said unto Abraham , that Sarah should give
children suck ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.614

for I have borne him a son in his old age . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.615

And the child grew ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.616

and was weaned : ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.617

and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.618

And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian , which she had borne unto
Abraham , mocking . Wherefore she said unto Abraham , Cast out this
bondwoman and her son : ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.619

for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with
Isaac . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.620

And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.621

And God said unto Abraham , Let it not be grievous in thy sight because
of the lad , and because of thy bondwoman ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.622

in all that Sarah saith unto thee , hearken unto her voice ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.623

for in Isaac shall thy seed be called . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.624

And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation , because he
is thy seed . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.625

And Abraham rose up early in the morning , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.626

and took bread and a bottle of water , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.627

and gave it unto Hagar , putting it on her shoulder , and the child ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.628

and sent her away : ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.629

and she departed , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.630

and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.631

And the water in the bottle was spent , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.632

and she cast the child under one of the shrubs .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.633

And she went , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.634

and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bowshot
: ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.635

for she said , Let me not look upon the death of the child .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.636

And she sat over against him , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.637

and lift up her voice , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.638

and wept . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.639

And God heard the voice of the lad ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.640

and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.641

and said unto her , What aileth thee , Hagar ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.642

fear not ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.643

for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.644

Arise , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.645

lift up the lad , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.646

and hold him in thine hand ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.647

for I will make him a great nation . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.648

And God opened her eyes , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.649

and she saw a well of water ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.650

and she went , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.651

and filled the bottle with water , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.652

and gave the lad drink . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.653

<P_21,20G> And God was with the lad , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.654

and he grew ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.655

and he dwelt in the wilderness , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.656

and became an archer . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.657

And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran : ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.658

and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.659

And it came to pass at that time , that Abimelech and Phicol the captain
of his host spake unto Abraham , saying , God is with thee in all that
thou doest : ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.660

now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely
with me , nor with my son , nor with my son's son :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.661

but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee , thou shalt do
unto me , and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.662

And Abraham said , I will swear . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.663

And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water , which
Abimelech's servants had violently taken away .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.664

And Abimelech said , I know not who hath done this thing :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.665

neither didst thou tell me , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.666

neither yet heard I of it , but to-day . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.667

And Abraham took sheep and oxen , ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.668

and gave them unto Abimelech ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.669

and they two made a covenant . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.670

And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.671

And Abimelech said unto Abraham , What mean these seven ewe lambs which
thou hast set by themselves ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.672

And he said , These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand , that it
may be a witness unto me , that I have digged this well .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.673

Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba ; because there they sware
both of them . ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.674

So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba : ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.675

and Abimelech rose up , and Phicol the captain of his host ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.676

and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.677

And <font> Abraham <$$font> planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.678

and called there on the name of the Lord , the Everlasting God .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.679

And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.680

<P_15,1N>

And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying , Speak unto the children of
Israel , ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.682

and say unto them , When ye be come into the land of your habitations ,
which I give unto you , and will make an offering by fire unto the Lord
, a burnt offering , or a sacrifice , to accomplish a vow , or as a
freewill offering , or in your set feasts , to make a sweet savour unto
the Lord , of the herd , or of the flock : then shall he that offereth
his oblation offer unto the Lord a meal offering of a tenth part <font>
of an ephah <$$font> of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of an
hin of oil : ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.683

and wine for the drink offering , the fourth part of an hin , shalt thou
prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice , for each lamb .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.684

Or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts
<font> of an ephah <$$font> of fine flour mingled with the third part of
an hin of oil : ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.685

and for the drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of
wine , of a sweet savour unto the Lord . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.686

And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a
sacrifice , to accomplish a vow , or for peace offerings unto the Lord :
then shall he offer with the bullock a meal offering of three tenth
parts <font> of an ephah <$$font> of fine flour mingled with half an hin
of oil . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.687

And thou shalt offer for the drink offering half an hin of wine , for an
offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.688

Thus shall it be done for each bullock , or for each ram , or for each
of the he-lambs , or of the kids . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.689

According to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do to every
one according to their number . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.690

All that are homeborn shall do these things after this manner , in
offering an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.691

And if a stranger sojourn with you , or whosoever be among you
throughout your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire ,
of a sweet savour unto the Lord ; as ye do , so he shall do .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.692

For the assembly , there shall be one statute for you , and for the
stranger that sojourneth <font> with you , <$$font> a statute for ever
throughout your generations : ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.693

as ye are , so shall the stranger be before the Lord .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.694

One law and one ordinance shall be for you , and for the stranger that
sojourneth with you . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.695

And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying , Speak unto the children of
Israel , ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.696

and say unto them , When ye come into the land whither I bring you ,
then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye
shall offer up an heave offering unto the Lord .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.697

<P_15,20N> Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for an
heave offering : ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.698

as ye do the heave offering of the threshing-floor , so shall ye heave
it . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.699

Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Lord an heave offering
throughout your generations . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.700

And when ye shall err , and not observe all these commandments , which
the Lord hath spoken unto Moses , even all that the Lord hath commanded
you by the hand of Moses , from the day that the Lord gave commandment ,
and onward throughout your generations ; then it shall be , if it be
done unwittingly , without the knowledge of the congregation , that all
the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering ,
for a sweet savour unto the Lord , with the meal offering thereof , and
the drink offering thereof , according to the ordinance , and one
he-goat for a sin offering . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.701

And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the
children of Israel , ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.702

and they shall be forgiven ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.703

for it was an error , ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.704

and they have brought their oblation , an offering made by fire unto the
Lord , and their sin offering before the Lord , for their error :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.705

and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven ,
and the stranger that sojourneth among them ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.706

for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.707

And if one person sin unwittingly , then he shall offer a she-goat of
the first year for a sin offering . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.708

And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth , when he
sinneth unwittingly , before the Lord , to make atonement for him ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.709

and he shall be forgiven . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.710

Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly , for him
that is homeborn among the children of Israel , and for the stranger
that sojourneth among them . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.711

But the soul that doeth aught with an high hand , whether he be homeborn
or a stranger , the same blasphemeth the Lord ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.712

and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.713

Because he hath despised the word of the Lord , and hath broken his
commandment ; that soul shall utterly be cut off ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.714

his iniquity shall be upon him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.715

And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a
man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.716

And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and
Aaron , and unto all the congregation . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.717

And they put him in ward , because it had not been declared what should
be done to him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.718

And the Lord said unto Moses , The man shall surely be put to death :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.719

all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.720

And all the congregation brought him without the camp ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.721

and stoned him with stones , ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.722

and he died ; as the Lord commanded Moses . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.723

And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying , Speak unto the children of
Israel , ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.724

and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their
garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the
fringe of each border a cord of blue : ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.725

and it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it , and
remember all the commandments of the Lord , and do them ; and that ye go
not about after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to
go a whoring : <P_15,40N> that ye may remember and do all my
commandments , and be holy unto your God . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,40N.726

I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt , to
be your God : ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,40N.727

I am the Lord your God . ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,40N.728

<P_18,1N> And the Lord said unto Aaron , Thou and thy sons and thy
fathers' house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.729

and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your
priesthood . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.730

And thy brethren also , the tribe of Levi , the tribe of thy father ,
bring thou near with thee , that they may be joined unto thee , and
minister unto thee : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.731

but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the
testimony . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.732

And they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of all the Tent :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.733

only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto
the altar , that they die not , neither they , nor ye .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.734

And they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tent of
meeting , for all the service of the Tent : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.735

and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.736

And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary , and the charge of the
altar : that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.737

And I , behold , I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the
children of Israel : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.738

to you they are a gift , given unto the Lord , to do the service of the
tent of meeting . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.739

And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for every
thing of the altar , and for that within the veil ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.740

and ye shall serve : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.741

I give you the priesthood as a service of gift :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.742

and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.743

And the Lord spake unto Aaron , And I , behold , I have given thee the
charge of mine heave offerings , even all the hallowed things of the
children of Israel , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.744

unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing , and to thy sons
, as a due for ever . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.745

This shall be thine of the most holy things , <font> reserved <$$font>
from the fire : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.746

every oblation of theirs , even every meal offering of theirs , and
every sin offering of theirs , and every guilt offering of theirs ,
which they shall render unto me , shall be most holy for thee and for
thy sons . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.747

As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.748

every male shall eat thereof ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.749

it shall be holy unto thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.750

And this is thine ; the heave offering of their gift , even all the wave
offerings of the children of Israel : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.751

I have given them unto thee , and to thy sons and to thy daughters with
thee , as a due for ever : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.752

every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.753

All the best of the oil , and all the best of the vintage , and of the
corn , the firstfruits of them which they give unto the Lord , to thee
have I given them . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.754

The first-ripe {TEXT:firstripe} fruits of all that is in their land ,
which they bring unto the Lord , shall be thine ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.755

every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.756

Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.757

Every thing that openeth the womb , of all flesh which they offer unto
the Lord , both of man and beast , shall be thine :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.758

nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.759

and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.760

And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou
redeem , according to thine estimation , for the money of five shekels ,
after the shekel of the sanctuary ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.761

<paren> the same is twenty gerahs <$$paren> . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.762

But the firstling of an ox , or the firstling of a sheep , or the
firstling of a goat , thou shalt not redeem ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.763

they are holy : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.764

thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.765

and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire , for a sweet
savour unto the Lord . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.766

And the flesh of them shall be thine , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.767

as the wave breast and as the right thigh , it shall be thine .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.768

All the heave offerings of the holy things , which the children of
Israel offer unto the Lord , have I given thee , and thy sons and thy
daughters with thee , as a due for ever : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.769

it is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord unto thee and to thy
seed with thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.770

<P_18,20N> And the Lord said unto Aaron , Thou shalt have no inheritance
in their land , ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.771

neither shalt thou have any portion among them :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.772

I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.773

And unto the children of Levi , behold , I have given all the tithe in
Israel for an inheritance , in return for their service which they serve
, even the service of the tent of meeting . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.774

And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of
meeting , lest they bear sin , and die . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.775

But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.776

and they shall bear their iniquity : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.777

it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.778

and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.779

For the tithe of the children of Israel , which they offer as an heave
offering unto the Lord , I have given to the Levites for an inheritance
: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.780

therefore I have said unto them , Among the children of Israel they
shall have no inheritance . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.781

And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying , Moreover thou shalt speak unto
the Levites , and say unto them , When ye take of the children of Israel
the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then
ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord , a tithe of the
tithe . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.782

And your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you , as though it were
the corn of the threshing-floor , and as the fulness of the winepress .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.783

Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the Lord of all your
tithes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.784

and thereof you shall give the Lord's heave offering to Aaron the priest
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.785

Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the Lord ,
of all the best thereof , even the hallowed part thereof out of it .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.786

Therefore thou shalt say unto them , When ye heave the best thereof from
it , then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the
threshing-floor , and as increase of the winepress .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.787

And ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.788

for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.789

And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it , when ye have heaved from it
the best thereof : ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.790

and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel ,
that ye die not . ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.791

<P_19,1N> And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying , This
is the statute of the law which the Lord hath commanded , saying , Speak
unto the children of Israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without
spot , wherein is no blemish , <font> and <$$font> upon which never came
yoke : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.792

and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.793

and he shall bring her forth without the camp , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.794

and one shall slay her before his face : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.795

and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and
sprinkle of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven
times : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.796

and one shall burn the heifer in his sight ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.797

her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her dung , shall he burn
: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.798

and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and
cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.799

Then the priest shall wash his clothes , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.800

and he shall bathe his flesh in water , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.801

and afterward he shall come into the camp , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.802

and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.803

And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water , and bathe his
flesh in water , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.804

and shall be unclean until the even . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.805

And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer , and
lay them up without the camp in a clean place , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.806

and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for
a water of separation : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.807

it is a sin offering . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.808

And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes ,
and be unclean until the even : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.809

and it shall be unto the children of Israel , and unto the stranger that
sojourneth among them , for a statute for ever .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.810

He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.811

the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.812

and on the seventh day he shall be clean : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.813

but if he purify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he
shall not be clean . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.814

Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead , and purifieth
not himself , defileth the tabernacle of the Lord ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.815

and that soul shall be cut off from Israel : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.816

because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him , he shall be
unclean ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.817

his uncleanness is yet upon him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.818

This is the law when a man dieth in a tent : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.819

every one that cometh into the tent , and every one that is in the tent
, shall be unclean seven days . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.820

And every open vessel , which hath no covering bound upon it , is
unclean . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.821

And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword
, or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean
seven days . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.822

And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the
sin offering , ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.823

and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.824

and a clean person shall take hyssop , and dip it in the water , and
sprinkle it upon the tent , and upon all the vessels , and upon the
persons that were there , and upon him that touched the bone , or the
slain , or the dead , or the grave : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.825

and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day ,
and on the seventh day : ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.826

and on the seventh day he shall purify him ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.827

and he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.828

and shall be clean at even . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.829

<P_19,20N> But the man that shall be unclean , and shall not purify
himself , that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly ,
because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the Lord :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.830

the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.831

he is unclean . ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.832

And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.833

and he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.834

and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.835

And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.836

and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.837

<P_20,1N> And the children of Israel , even the whole congregation ,
came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.838

and the people abode in Kadesh ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.839

and Miriam died there , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.840

and was buried there . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.841

And there was no water for the congregation : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.842

and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.843

And the people strove with Moses , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.844

and spake , saying , Would God that we had died when our brethen died
before the Lord ! ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.845

And why have ye brought the assembly of the Lord into this wilderness ,
that we should die there , we and our cattle ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.846

And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt , to bring us in
unto this evil place ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.847

it is no place of seed , or of figs , or of vines , or of pomegranates ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.848

neither is there any water to drink . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.849

And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door
of the tent of meeting , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.850

and fell upon their faces : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.851

and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.852

And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying Take the rod ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.853

and assemble the congregation , thou , and Aaron thy brother ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.854

and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes , that it give forth its
water ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.855

and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.856

so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.857

And Moses took the rod from before the Lord , as he commanded him .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.858

And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.859

and he said unto them , Hear now , ye rebels ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.860

shall we bring you forth water out of this rock ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.861

And Moses lifted up his hand , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.862

and smote the rock with his rod twice : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.863

and water came forth abundantly , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.864

and the congregation drank , and their cattle .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.865

And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron , Because ye believed not in me ,
to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye
shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.866

These are the waters of Meribah ; because the children of Israel strove
with the Lord , and he was sanctified in them .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.867

And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.868

Thus saith thy brother Israel , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.869

Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us : how our fathers
went down into Egypt , and we dwelt in Egypt a long time ; and the
Egyptians evil entreated us , and our fathers : and when we cried unto
the Lord , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and brought us forth
out of Egypt : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.870

and , behold , we are in Kadesh , a city in the uttermost of thy border
: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.871

let us pass , I pray thee , through thy land : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.872

we will not pass through field or through vineyard ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.873

neither will we drink of the water of the wells :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.874

we will go along the king's <font> high <$$font> way ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.875

we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left , until we have
passed thy border . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.876

And Edom said unto him , Thou shalt not pass through me , lest I come
out with the sword against thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.877

And the children of Israel said unto him , We will go up by the high way
: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.878

and if we drink of thy water , I and my cattle , then will I give the
price thereof : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.879

let me only , without <font> doing <$$font> any thing <font> else ,
<$$font> pass through on my feet . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.880

<P_20,20N> And he said , Thou shalt not pass through .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.881

And Edom came out against him with much people , and with a strong hand
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.882

Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border : wherefore
Israel turned away from him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.883

And they journeyed from Kadesh : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.884

and the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , came unto
mount Hor . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.885

And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor , by the border of
the land of Edom , saying , Aaron shall be gathered unto his people :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.886

for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the
children of Israel , because ye rebelled against my word at the waters
of Meribah . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.887

Take Aaron and Eleazar his son , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.888

and bring them up unto mount Hor : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.889

and strip Aaron of his garments , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.890

and put them upon Eleazar his son : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.891

and Aaron shall be gathered <font> unto his people , <$$font>
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.892

and shall die there . ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.893

And Moses did as the Lord commanded : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.894

and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.895

And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments , ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.896

and put them upon Eleazar his son ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.897

and Aaron died there in the top of the mount : ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.898

and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.899

And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they wept for
Aaron thirty days , even all the House of Israel .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.900

<P_1,1D>

<heading>

The Fifth Book of Moses , commonly called Deuteronomy .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.903

<$$heading>

These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel beyond Jordan in
the wilderness , in the Arabah over against Suph , between Paran , and
Tophel , and Laban , and Hazeroth , and Di-zahab .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.905

It is eleven days' <font> journey <$$font> from Horeb by the way of
mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.906

And it came to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on
the first day of the month , that Moses spake unto the children of
Israel , according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment
unto them ; after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites , which
dwelt in Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , which dwelt in Ashtaroth
, at Edrei : ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.907

beyond Jordan , in the land of Moab , began Moses to declare this law ,
saying , The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb , saying , Ye have
dwelt long enough in this mountain : ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.908

turn you , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.909

and take your journey , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.910

and go to the hill country of the Amorites , and unto all <font> the
places <$$font> nigh thereunto , in the Arabah , in the hill country ,
and in the lowland , and in the South , and by the sea shore , the land
of the Canaanites , and Lebanon , as far as the great river , the river
Euphrates . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.911

Behold , I have set the land before you : ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.912

go in ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.913

and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers , to Abraham
, to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give unto them and to their seed after
them . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.914

And I spake unto you at that time , saying , I am not able to bear you
myself alone : ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.915

the Lord your God hath multiplied you , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.916

and , behold , ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.917

The Lord , the God of your fathers , make you a_thousand times so many
more as ye are , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.918

and bless you , as he hath promised you ! ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.919

How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance , and your burden , and your
strife ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.920

Take you wise men , and understanding , and known , according to your
tribes , and I will make them heads over you . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.921

And ye answered me , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.922

and said , The thing which thou hast spoken is good <font> for us
<$$font> to do . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.923

So I took the heads of your tribes , wise men , and known ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.924

and made them heads over you , captains of thousands , and captains of
hundreds , and captains of fifties , and captains of tens , and officers
, according to your tribes . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.925

And I charged your judges at that time , saying , Hear <font> the causes
<$$font> between your brethren , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.926

and judge righteously between a man and his brother , and the stranger
that is with him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.927

Ye shall not respect persons in judgement ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.928

ye shall hear the small and the great alike ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.929

ye shall not be afraid of the face of man ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.930

for the judgement is God's : ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.931

and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.932

and I will hear it . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.933

And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.934

And we journeyed from Horeb , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.935

and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw ,
by the way to the hill country of the Amorites , as the Lord our God
commanded us ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.936

and we came to Kadesh-barnea . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.937

<P_1,20D> And I said unto you , Ye are come unto the hill country of the
Amorites , which the Lord our God giveth unto us .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.938

Behold , the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.939

go up , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.940

take possession , as the Lord , the God of thy fathers , hath spoken
unto thee ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.941

fear not , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.942

neither be dismayed . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.943

And ye came near unto me every one of you , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.944

and said , Let us send men before us , that they may search the land for
us , and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up , and the
cities unto which we shall come . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.945

And the thing pleased me well : ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.946

and I took twelve men of you , one man for every tribe :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.947

and they turned ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.948

and went up into the mountain , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.949

and came unto the valley of Eshcol , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.950

and spied it out . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.951

And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.952

and brought it down unto us , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.953

and brought us word again , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.954

and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God giveth unto us .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.955

Yet ye would not go up , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.956

but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.957

and ye murmured in your tents , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.958

and said , Because the Lord hated us , he hath brought us forth out of
the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to
destroy us . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.959

Whither are we going up ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.960

our brethren have made our heart to melt , saying , The people is
greater and taller than we ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.961

the cities are great and fenced up to heaven ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.962

and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.963

Then I said unto you , Dread not , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.964

neither be afraid of them . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.965

The Lord your God who goeth before you , he shall fight for you ,
according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes ; and in
the wilderness , where thou hast seen how that the Lord thy God bare
thee , as a man doth bear his son , in all the way that ye went , until
ye came unto this place . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.966

Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God , who went before
you in the way , to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in , in
fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should go , in the cloud by
day . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.967

And the Lord heard the voice of your words , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.968

and was wroth , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.969

and sware , saying , Surely there shall not one of these men of this
evil generation see the good land , which I sware to give unto your
fathers , save Caleb the son of Jephunneh , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.970

he shall see it ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.971

and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon , and to his
children : because he hath wholly followed the Lord .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.972

Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes , saying , Thou also
shalt not go in thither : ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.973

Joshua the son of Nun , which standeth before thee , he shall go in
thither : ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.974

encourage thou him ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.975

for he shall cause Israel to inherit it . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.976

Moreover your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , and your
children , which this day have no knowledge of good or evil , they shall
go in thither , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.977

and unto them will I give it , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.978

and they shall possess it . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.979

<P_1,40D> But as for you , turn you , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.980

and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.981

Then ye answered ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.982

and said unto me , We have sinned against the Lord ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.983

we will go up and fight , according to all that the Lord our God
commanded us . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.984

And ye girded on every man his weapons of war , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.985

and were forward to go up into the mountain . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.986

And the Lord said unto me , Say unto them , Go not up ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.987

neither fight ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.988

for I am not among you ; lest ye be smitten before your enemies .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.989

So I spake unto you , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.990

and ye hearkened not ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.991

but ye rebelled against the commandment of the Lord ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.992

and were presumptuous , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.993

and went up into the mountain . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.994

And the Amorites , which dwelt in that mountain , came out against you ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.995

and chased you , as bees do , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.996

and beat you down in Seir , even unto Hormah . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.997

And ye returned ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.998

and wept before the Lord ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.999

but the Lord hearkened not to your voice , ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.1000

nor gave ear unto you . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.1001

So ye abode in Kadesh many days , according unto the days that ye abode
<font> there <$$font> . ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.1002

<P_2,1D> Then we turned , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1003

and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea , as
the Lord spake unto me : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1004

and we compassed mount Seir many days . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1005

And the Lord spake unto me , saying , Ye have compassed this mountain
long enough : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1006

turn you northward . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1007

And command thou the people , saying , Ye are to pass through the border
of your brethren the children of Esau , which dwell in Seir ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1008

and they shall be afraid of you : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1009

take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1010

contend not with them ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1011

for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as for the sole
of the foot to tread on : because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for
a possession . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1012

Ye shall purchase food of them for money , that ye may eat ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1013

and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1014

For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1015

he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1016

these forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1017

thou hast lacked nothing . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1018

So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau , which dwell in
Seir , from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1019

And we turned ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1020

and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1021

And the Lord said unto me , Vex not Moab , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1022

neither contend with them in battle : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1023

for I will not give thee of his land for a possession ; because I have
given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1024

<paren> The Emim dwelt therein aforetime , a people great , and many ,
and tall , as the Anakim : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1025

these also are accounted Rephaim , as the Anakim ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1026

but the Moabites call them Emim . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1027

The Horites also dwelt in Seir aforetime , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1028

but the children of Esau succeeded them ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1029

and they destroyed them from before them , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1030

and dwelt in their stead ; as Israel did unto the land of his possession
, which the Lord gave unto them . <$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1031

Now rise up , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1032

and get you over the brook Zered . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1033

And we went over the brook Zered . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1034

And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea , until we were come
over the brook Zered , were thirty_and_eight years ; until all the
generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp ,
as the Lord sware unto them . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1035

Moreover , the hand of the Lord was against them , to destroy them from
the midst of the camp , until they were consumed .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1036

So it came to pass , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from
among the people , that the Lord spake unto me , saying , Thou art this
day to pass over Ar , the border of Moab : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1037

and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon , vex them
not , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1038

nor contend with them : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1039

for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a
possession : because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a
possession . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1040

<P_2,20D> <paren> That also is accounted a land of Rephaim :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1041

Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1042

but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim ; a people great , and many , and
tall , as the Anakim ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1043

but the Lord destroyed them before them ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1044

and they succeeded them , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1045

and dwelt in their stead : as he did for the children of Esau , which
dwell in Seir , when he destroyed the Horites from before them ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1046

and they succeeded them , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1047

and dwelt in their stead even unto this day : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1048

and the Avvim which dwelt in villages as far as Gaza , the Caphtorim ,
which came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1049

and dwelt in their stead . <$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1050

Rise ye up , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1051

take your journey , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1052

and pass over the valley of Arnon : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1053

behold , I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite , king of
Heshbon , and his land : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1054

begin to possess it , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1055

and contend with him in battle . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1056

This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon
the peoples that are under the whole heaven , who shall hear the report
of thee , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of thee .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1057

And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king
of Heshbon with words of peace , saying , Let me pass through thy land :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1058

I will go along by the high way , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1059

I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1060

Thou shalt sell me food for money , that I may eat ; and give me water
for money , that I may drink : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1061

only let me pass through on my feet ; as the children of Esau which
dwell in Seir , and the Moabites which dwell in Ar , did unto me ; until
I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the Lord our God giveth us
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1062

But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1063

for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1064

and made his heart obstinate , that he might deliver him into thy hand ,
as at this day . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1065

And the Lord said unto me , Behold , I have begun to deliver up Sihon
and his land before thee : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1066

begin to possess , that thou mayest inherit his land .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1067

Then Sihon came out against us , he and all his people , unto battle at
Jahaz . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1068

And the Lord our God delivered him up before us ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1069

and we smote him , and his sons , and all his people .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1070

And we took all his cities at that time , ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1071

and utterly destroyed every inhabited city , with the women and the
little ones ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1072

we left none remaining : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1073

only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , with the spoil of
the cities which we had taken . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1074

From Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon , and <font>
from <$$font> the city that is in the valley , even unto Gilead , there
was not a city too high for us : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1075

the Lord our God delivered up all before us : ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1076

only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1077

all the side of the river Jabbok , and the cities of the hill country ,
and wheresoever the Lord our God forbad us . ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1078

<P_3,1D> Then we turned , ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1079

and went up the way to Bashan : ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1080

and Og the king of Bashan came out against us , he and all his people ,
unto battle at Edrei . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1081

And the Lord said unto me , Fear him not : ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1082

for I have delivered him , and all his people , and his land , into thy
hand ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1083

and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites
, which dwelt at Heshbon . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1084

So the Lord our God delivered into our hand Og also , the king of Bashan
, and all his people : ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1085

and we smote him until none was left to him remaining .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1086

And we took all his cities at that time ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1087

there was not a city which we took not from them ; threescore cities ,
all the region of Argob , the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1088

All these were cities fenced with high walls , gates , and bars ; beside
the unwalled towns a great many . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1089

And we utterly destroyed them , as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon ,
utterly destroying every inhabited city , with the women and the little
ones . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1090

But all the cattle , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey
unto ourselves . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1091

And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of
the Amorites that were beyond Jordan , from the valley of Arnon unto
mount Hermon ; <paren> <font> which <$$font> Hermon the Sidonians call
Sirion , and the Amorites call it Senir ; <$$paren> all the cities of
the plain , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , unto Salecah and Edrei ,
cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1092

<paren> For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the
Rephaim ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1093

behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1094

is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1095

nine cubits was the length thereof , and four cubits the breadth of it ,
after the cubit of a man . <$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1096

And this land we took in possession at that time :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1097

from Aroer , which is by the valley of Arnon , and half the hill country
of Gilead , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Reubenites and to
the Gadites : ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1098

and the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , the kingdom of Og , gave I
unto the half tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , even all
Bashan . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1099

<paren> The same is called the land of Rephaim .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1100

Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob , unto the border
of the Geshurites and the Maacathites ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1101

and called them , even Bashan , after his own name , Havvoth-jair , unto
this day . <$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1102

And I gave Gilead unto Machir . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1103

And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even
unto the valley of Arnon , the middle of the valley , and the border
<font> thereof <$$font> ; even unto the river Jabbok , which is the
border of the children of Ammon ; the Arabah also , and Jordan and the
border <font> thereof <$$font> , from Chinnereth even unto the sea of
the Arabah , the Salt Sea , under the slopes of Pisgah eastward .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1104

And I commanded you at that time , saying , The Lord your God hath given
you this land to possess it : ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1105

ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel ,
all the men of valour . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1106

But your wives , and your little ones , and your cattle , <paren> I know
that ye have much cattle , <$$paren> shall abide in your cities which I
have given you ; <P_3,20D> until the Lord give rest unto your brethren ,
as unto you , and they also possess the land which the Lord your God
giveth them beyond Jordan : ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1107

then shall ye return every man unto his possession , which I have given
you . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1108

And I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , Thine eyes have seen all
that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1109

so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1110

Ye shall not fear them : ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1111

for the Lord your God , he it is that fighteth for you .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1112

And I besought the Lord at that time , saying , O Lord God , thou hast
begun to shew thy servant thy greatness , and thy strong hand :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1113

for what god is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to
thy works , and according to thy mighty acts ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1114

Let me go over , I pray thee , and see the good land that is beyond
Jordan , that goodly mountain , and Lebanon . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1115

But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1116

and hearkened not unto me : ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1117

and the Lord said unto me , Let it suffice thee ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1118

speak no more unto me of this matter . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1119

Get thee up into the top of Pisgah , ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1120

and lift up thine eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and
eastward , ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1121

and behold with thine eyes : ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1122

for thou shalt not go over this Jordan . ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1123

But charge Joshua , ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1124

and encourage him , ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1125

and strengthen him : ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1126

for he shall go over before this people , ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1127

and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1128

So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1129

<P_4,1D> And now , O Israel , hearken unto the statutes and unto the
judgements , which I teach you , for to do them ; that ye may live , and
go in and possess the land which the Lord , the God of your fathers ,
giveth you . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1130

Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1131

neither shall ye diminish from it , that ye may keep the commandments of
the Lord your God which I command you . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1132

Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal-peor :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1133

for all the men that followed Baal-peor , the Lord thy God hath
destroyed them from the midst of thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1134

But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you
this day . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1135

Behold , I have taught you statutes and judgements , even as the Lord my
God commanded me , that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither
ye go in to possess it . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1136

Keep therefore and do them ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1137

for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the
peoples , which shall hear all these statutes , and say , Surely this
great nation is a wise and understanding people .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1138

For what great nation is there , that hath a god so nigh unto them , as
the Lord our God is whensoever we call upon him ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1139

And what great nation is there , that hath statutes and judgements so
righteous as all this law , which I set before you this day ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1140

Only take heed to thyself , ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1141

and keep thy soul diligently , lest thou forget the things which thine
eyes saw , and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life
; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1142

but make them known unto thy children and thy children's children ; the
day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb , when the Lord
said unto me , Assemble me the people , ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1143

and I will make them hear my words , that they may learn to fear me all
the days that they live upon the earth , and that they may teach their
children . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1144

And ye came near ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1145

and stood under the mountain ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1146

and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven , with
darkness , cloud , and thick darkness . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1147

And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1148

ye heard the voice of words , ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1149

but ye saw no form ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1150

only <font> ye heard <$$font> a voice . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1151

And he declared unto you his covenant , which he commanded you to
perform , even the ten commandments ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1152

and he wrote them upon two tables of stone . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1153

And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
judgements , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to
possess it . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1154

Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1155

for ye saw no manner of form on the day that the Lord spake unto you in
Horeb out of the midst of the fire : lest ye corrupt yourselves , and
make you a graven image in the form of any figure , the likeness of male
or female , the likeness of any beast that is on the earth , the
likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the heaven , the likeness of
any thing that creepeth on the ground , the likeness of any fish that is
in the water under the earth : and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto
heaven , and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars , even
all the host of heaven , thou be drawn away and worship them , and serve
them , which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all the peoples under
the whole heaven . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1156

<P_4,20D> But the Lord hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the
iron furnace , out of Egypt , to be unto him a people of inheritance ,
as at this day . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1157

Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1158

and sware that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in
unto that good land , which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an
inheritance : ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1159

but I must die in this land , ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1160

I must not go over Jordan : ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1161

but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1162

Take heed unto yourselves , lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your
God , which he made with you , and make you a graven image in the form
of any thing which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1163

For the Lord thy God is a devouring fire , a jealous God .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1164

When thou shalt beget children , and children's children , and ye shall
have been long in the land , and shall corrupt yourselves , and make a
graven image in the form of any thing , and shall do that which is evil
in the sight of the Lord thy God , to provoke him to anger : I call
heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that ye shall soon
utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess
it ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1165

ye shall not prolong your days upon it , ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1166

but shall utterly be destroyed . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1167

And the Lord shall scatter you among the peoples ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1168

and ye shall be left few in number among the nations , whither the Lord
shall lead you away . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1169

And there ye shall serve gods , the work of men's hands , wood and stone
, which neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor smell .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1170

But if from thence ye shall seek the Lord thy God , thou shalt find him
, if thou search after him with all thy heart and with all thy soul .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1171

When thou art in tribulation , and all these things are come upon thee ,
in the latter days thou shalt return to the Lord thy God , and hearken
unto his voice : ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1172

for the Lord thy God is a merciful God ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1173

he will not fail thee , neither destroy thee , nor forget the covenant
of thy fathers which he sware unto them . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1174

For ask now of the days that are past , which were before thee , since
the day that God created man upon the earth , and from the one end of
heaven unto the other , whether there hath been <font> any such thing
<$$font> as this great thing is , or hath been heard like it ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1175

Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the
fire , as thou hast heard , and live ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1176

Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of <font>
another <$$font> nation , by temptations , by signs , and by wonders ,
and by war , and by a mighty hand , and by a stretched out arm , and by
great terrors , according to all that the Lord your God did for you in
Egypt before your eyes ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1177

Unto thee it was shewed , that thou mightest know that the Lord he is
God ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1178

there is none else beside him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1179

Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice , that he might instruct
thee : ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1180

and upon earth he made thee to see his great fire ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1181

and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1182

And because he loved thy fathers , therefore he chose their seed after
them , ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1183

and brought thee out with his presence , with his great power , out of
Egypt ; to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than
thou , to bring thee in , to give thee their land for an inheritance ,
as at this day . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1184

Know therefore this day , and lay it to thine heart , that the Lord he
is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1185

there is none else . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1186

<P_4,40D> And thou shalt keep his statutes , and his commandments ,
which I command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with
thy children after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the
land , which the Lord thy God giveth thee , for ever .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,40D.1187

Then Moses separated three cities beyond Jordan toward the sun-rising
{TEXT:sunrising} ; that the manslayer might flee thither , which slayeth
his neighbour unawares , and hated him not in time past ; and that
fleeing unto one of these cities he might live : <font> namely ,
<$$font> Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , for the
Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead , for the Gadites ; and Golan in
Bashan , for the Manassites . ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,40D.1188

And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,40D.1189

these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgements ,
which Moses spake unto the children of Israel , when they came forth out
of Egypt ; beyond Jordan , in the valley over against Beth-peor , in the
land of Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon , whom Moses
and the children of Israel smote , when they came forth out of Egypt :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,40D.1190

and they took his land in possession , and the land of Og king of Bashan
, the two kings of the Amorites , which were beyond Jordan toward the
sun-rising {TEXT:sunrising} ; from Aroer , which is on the edge of the
valley of Arnon , even unto mount Sion <paren> the same is Hermon
<$$paren> , and all the Arabah beyond Jordan eastward , even unto the
sea of the Arabah , under the slopes of Pisgah .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,40D.1191

<P_5,1D> And Moses called unto all Israel , ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1192

and said unto them , Hear , O Israel , the statutes and the judgements
which I speak in your ears this day , that ye may learn them , and
observe to do them . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1193

The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1194

The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us
, who are all of us here alive this day . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1195

The Lord spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of
the fire , <paren> I stood between the Lord and you at that time , to
shew you the word of the Lord : for ye were afraid because of the fire ,
and went not up into the mount ; <$$paren> saying , I am the Lord thy
God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of
bondage . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1196

Thou shalt have none other gods before me . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1197

Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image , <font> the likeness of
<$$font> any form that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth
beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1198

thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them , nor serve them :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1199

for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children , and upon the third and upon the fourth
generation of them that hate me ; and shewing mercy unto thousands , of
them that love me and keep my commandments . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1200

Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1201

for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1202

Observe the sabbath day , to keep it holy , as the Lord thy God
commanded thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1203

Six days shalt thou labour , and do all thy work :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1204

but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the Lord thy God :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1205

<font> in it <$$font> thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son ,
nor thy daughter , nor thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thine
ox , nor thine ass , nor any of thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is
within thy gates ; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as
well as thou . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1206

And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt ,
and the Lord thy God brought thee out thence by a mighty hand and by a
stretched out arm : ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1207

therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1208

Honour thy father and thy mother , as the Lord thy God commanded thee :
that thy days may be long , and that it may go well with thee , upon the
land which the Lord thy God giveth thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1209

Thou shalt do no murder . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1210

Neither shalt thou commit adultery . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1211

Neither shalt thou steal . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1212

<P_5,20D>

Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1214

Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's wife ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1215

neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's house , his field , or his
manservant , or his maidservant , his ox , or his ass , or any thing
that is thy neighbour's . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1216

These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of
the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thick darkness , with
a great voice : ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1217

and he added no more . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1218

And he wrote them upon two tables of stone , ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1219

and gave them unto me . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1220

And it came to pass , when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the
darkness , while the mountain did burn with fire , that ye came near
unto me , even all the heads of your tribes , and your elders ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1221

and ye said , Behold , the Lord our God hath shewed us his glory and his
greatness , ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1222

and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1223

we have seen this day that God doth speak with man , and he liveth .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1224

Now therefore why should we die ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1225

for this great fire will consume us : ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1226

if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more , then we shall die .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1227

For who is there of all flesh , that hath heard the voice of the living
God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1228

Go thou near , ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1229

and hear all that the Lord our God shall say : ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1230

and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1231

and we will hear it , and do it . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1232

And the Lord heard the voice of your words , when ye spake unto me ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1233

and the Lord said unto me , I have heard the voice of the words of this
people , which they have spoken unto thee : ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1234

they have well said all that they have spoken .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1235

Oh that there were such an heart in them , that they would fear me , and
keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and
with their children for ever ! ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1236

Go say to them , Return ye to your tents . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1237

But as for thee , stand thou here by me , and I will speak unto thee all
the commandment , and the statutes , and the judgements , which thou
shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them
to possess it . ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1238

Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God hath commanded you
: ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1239

ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1240

Ye shall walk in all the way which the Lord your God hath commanded you
, that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may
prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1241

<P_6,1D> Now this is the commandment , the statutes , and the judgements
, which the Lord your God commanded to teach you , that ye might do them
in the land whither ye go over to possess it : that thou mightest fear
the Lord thy God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which
I command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son's son , all the days
of thy life ; and that thy days may be prolonged .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1242

Hear therefore , O Israel , ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1243

and observe to do it ; that it may be well with thee , and that ye may
increase mightily , as the Lord , the God of thy fathers , hath promised
unto thee , in a land flowing with milk and honey .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1244

Hear , O Israel : ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1245

the Lord our God is one Lord : ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1246

and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart , and with all
thy soul , and with all thy might . ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1247

And these words , which I command thee this day , shall be upon thine
heart : ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1248

and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1249

and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou
walkest by the way , and when thou liest down , and when thou risest up
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1250

And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1251

and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1252

And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house , and upon
thy gates . ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1253

And it shall be , when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land
which he sware unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ,
to give thee ; great and goodly cities , which thou buildest not , and
houses full of all good things , which thou filledst not , and cisterns
hewn out , which thou hewedst not , vineyards and olive trees , which
thou plantedst not , and thou shalt eat and be full ; then beware lest
thou forget the Lord , which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt
, out of the house of bondage . ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1254

Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1255

and him shalt thou serve , ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1256

and shalt swear by his name . ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1257

Ye shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the peoples which are
round about you ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1258

for the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is a jealous God ; lest the
anger of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee , and he destroy thee
from off the face of the earth . ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1259

Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God , as ye tempted him in Massah .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1260

Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God , and his
testimonies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1261

And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord
: that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess
the good land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers , to thrust out all
thine enemies from before thee , as the Lord hath spoken .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1262

<P_6,20D> When thy son asketh thee in time to come , saying , What mean
the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgements , which the Lord
our God hath commanded you ? then thou shalt say unto thy son , We were
Pharoah's bondmen in Egypt ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1263

and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1264

and the Lord shewed signs and wonders , great and sore , upon Egypt ,
upon Pharaoh , and upon all his house , before our eyes :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1265

and he brought us out from thence , that he might bring us in , to give
us the land which he sware unto our fathers . ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1266

And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes , to fear the Lord
our God , for our good always , that he might preserve us alive , as at
this day . ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1267

And it shall be righteousness unto us , if we observe to do all this
commandment before the Lord our God , as he hath commanded us .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1268

<P_7,1D> When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither
thou goest to possess it , and shall cast out many nations before thee ,
the Hittite , and the Girgashite , and the Amorite , and the Canaanite ,
and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite , seven nations
greater and mightier than thou ; and when the Lord thy God shall deliver
them up before thee , and thou shalt smite them ; then thou shalt
utterly destroy them ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1269

thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor shew mercy unto them :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1270

neither shalt thou make marriages with them ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1271

thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1272

nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1273

For he will turn away thy son from following me , that they may serve
other gods : ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1274

so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1275

and he will destroy thee quickly . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1276

But thus shall ye deal with them ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1277

ye shall break down their altars , and dash in pieces their pillars ,
and hew down their Asherim , and burn their graven images with fire .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1278

For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1279

the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself ,
above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1280

The Lord did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye
were more in number than any people ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1281

for ye were the fewest of all peoples : ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1282

but because the Lord loveth you , and because he would keep the oath
which he sware unto your fathers , hath the Lord brought you out with a
mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage , from the
hand of Pharoah king of Egypt . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1283

Know therefore that the Lord thy God , he is God ; the faithful God ,
which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his
commandments to a_thousand generations ; and repayeth them that hate him
to their face , to destroy them : ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1284

he will not be slack to him that hateth him , ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1285

he will repay him to his face . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1286

Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment , and the statutes , and the
judgements , which I command thee this day , to do them .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1287

And it shall come to pass , because ye hearken to these judgements , and
keep , and do them , that the Lord thy God shall keep with thee the
covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1288

and he will love thee , and bless thee , and multiply thee :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1289

he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground ,
thy corn and thy wine and thine oil , the increase of thy kine and the
young of thy flock , in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give
thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1290

Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples : ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1291

there shall not be male or female barren among you , or among your
cattle . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1292

And the Lord will take away from thee all sickness ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1293

and he will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which thou knowest
, upon thee , ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1294

but will lay them upon all them that hate thee .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1295

And thou shalt consume all the peoples which the Lord thy God shall
deliver unto thee ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1296

thine eye shall not pity them : ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1297

neither shalt thou serve their gods ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1298

for that will be a snare unto thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1299

If thou shalt say in thine heart , These nations are more than I ; how
can I dispossess them ? thou shalt not be afraid of them :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1300

thou shalt well remember what the Lord thy God did unto Pharaoh , and
unto all Egypt ; the great temptations which thine eyes saw , and the
signs , and the wonders , and the mighty hand , and the stretched out
arm , whereby the Lord thy God brought thee out :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1301

so shall the Lord thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art
afraid . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1302

<P_7,20D> Moreover the Lord thy God will send the hornet among them ,
until they that are left , and hide themselves , perish from before thee
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1303

Thou shalt not be affrighted at them : ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1304

for the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee , a great God and a
terrible . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1305

And the Lord thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little
and little : ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1306

thou mayest not consume them at once , lest the beasts of the field
increase upon thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1307

But the Lord thy God shall deliver them up before thee ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1308

and shall discomfit them with a great discomfiture , until they be
destroyed . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1309

And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1310

and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1311

there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have
destroyed them . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1312

The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1313

thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them , nor take
it unto thee , lest thou be snared therein : ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1314

for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God : ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1315

and thou shalt not bring an abomination into thine house , and become a
devoted thing like unto it : ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1316

thou shalt utterly detest it , ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1317

and thou shalt utterly abhor it ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1318

for it is a devoted thing . ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1319

<P_8,1D> All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye
observe to do , that ye may live , and multiply , and go in and possess
the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1320

And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God hath led thee
these forty years in the wilderness , that he might humble thee , to
prove thee , to know what was in thine heart , whether thou wouldest
keep his commandments , or no . ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1321

And he humbled thee , ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1322

and suffered thee to hunger , ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1323

and fed thee with manna , which thou knewest not , neither did thy
fathers know ; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by
bread only , but by every thing that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
Lord doth man live . ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1324

Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee , ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1325

neither did thy foot swell , these forty years .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1326

And thou shalt consider in thine heart , that , as a man chasteneth his
son , so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1327

And thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God , to walk in
his ways , and to fear him . ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1328

For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land , a land of brooks
of water , of fountains and depths , springing forth in valleys and
hills ; a land of wheat and barley , and vines and fig trees and
pomegranates ; a land of oil {COM:missing_comma} olives and honey ; a
land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness , thou shalt not
lack any thing in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose
hills thou mayest dig brass . ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1329

And thou shalt eat and be full , ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1330

and thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath
given thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1331

Beware lest thou forget the Lord thy God , in not keeping his
commandments , and his judgements , and his statutes , which I command
thee this day : lest when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built
goodly houses , and dwelt therein ; and when thy herds and thy flocks
multiply , and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied , and all that thou
hast is multiplied ; then thine heart be lifted up , and thou forget the
Lord thy God , which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , out
of the house of bondage ; who led thee through the great and terrible
wilderness , wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions , and thirsty
ground where was no water ; who brought thee forth water out of the rock
of flint ; who fed thee in the wilderness with manna , which thy fathers
knew not ; that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to
do thee good at thy latter end : and thou say in thine heart , My power
and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1332

But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God , ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1333

for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth ; that he may
establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers , as at this day
. ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1334

And it shall be , if thou shalt forget the Lord thy God , and walk after
other gods , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you
this day that ye shall surely perish . ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1335

<P_8,20G> As the nations which the Lord maketh to perish before you , so
shall ye perish ; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of the
Lord your God . ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,20G.1336

<P_9,1D> Hear , O Israel : ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1337

thou art to pass over Jordan this day , to go in to possess nations
greater and mightier than thyself , cities great and fenced up to heaven
, a people great and tall , the sons of the Anakim , whom thou knowest ,
and of whom thou hast heard say , Who can stand before the sons of Anak
? ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1338

Know therefore this day , that the Lord thy God is he which goeth over
before thee as a devouring fire ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1339

he shall destroy them , ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1340

and he shall bring them down before thee : ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1341

so shalt thou drive them out , and make them to perish quickly , as the
Lord hath spoken unto thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1342

Speak not thou in thine heart , after that the Lord thy God hath thrust
them out from before thee , saying , For my righteousness the Lord hath
brought me in to possess this land : whereas for the wickedness of these
nations the Lord doth drive them out from before thee .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1343

Not for thy righteousness , or for the uprightness of thine heart , dost
thou go in to possess their land : but for the wickedness of these
nations that the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee , and
that he may establish the word which the Lord sware unto thy fathers ,
to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1344

Know therefore , that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land to
possess it for thy righteousness ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1345

for thou art a stiffnecked people . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1346

Remember , forget thou not , how thou provokedst the Lord thy God to
wrath in the wilderness : ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1347

from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt , until ye
came unto this place , ye have been rebellious against the Lord .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1348

Also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath , ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1349

and the Lord was angry with you to have destroyed you .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1350

When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even
the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you , then I abode
in the mount forty days and forty nights ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1351

I did neither eat bread nor drink water . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1352

And the Lord delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the
finger of God ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1353

and on them <font> was written <$$font> according to all the words ,
which the Lord spake with you in the mount of the midst of the fire in
the day of the assembly . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1354

And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights , that the
Lord gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1355

And the Lord said unto me , Arise , ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1356

get thee down quickly from hence ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1357

for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted
themselves ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1358

they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1359

they have made them a molten image . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1360

Furthermore the Lord spake unto me , saying , I have seen this people ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1361

and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people : ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1362

let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their name from
under heaven : ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1363

and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1364

So I turned ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1365

and came down from the mount , ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1366

and the mount burned with fire : ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1367

and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1368

And I looked , ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1369

and , behold , ye had sinned against the Lord your God ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1370

ye had made you a molten calf : ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1371

ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded
you . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1372

And I took hold of the two tables , ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1373

and cast them out of my two hands , ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1374

and brake them before your eyes . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1375

And I fell down before the Lord , as at the first , forty days and forty
nights ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1376

I did neither eat bread nor drink water ; because of all your sin which
ye sinned , in doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , to
provoke him to anger . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1377

For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , wherewith the Lord
was wroth against you to destroy you . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1378

But the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1379

<P_9,20D> And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1380

and I prayed for Aaron also the same time . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1381

And I took your sin , the calf which ye had made ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1382

and burnt it with fire , ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1383

and stamped it , grinding it very small , until it was as fine as dust :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1384

and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the
mount . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1385

And at Taberah , and at Massah , and at Kibroth-hattaavah , ye provoked
the Lord to wrath . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1386

And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea , saying , Go up and
possess the land which I have given you ; then ye rebelled against the
commandment of the Lord your God , ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1387

and ye believed him not , ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1388

nor hearkened to his voice . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1389

Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1390

So I fell down before the Lord the forty days and forty nights that I
fell down ; because the Lord had said he would destroy you .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1391

And I prayed unto the Lord , ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1392

and said , O Lord God , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance ,
which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness , which thou has brought
forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1393

Remember thy servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1394

look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness
, nor to their sin : lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say ,
Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he
promised unto them , and because he hated them , he hath brought them
out to slay them in the wilderness . ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1395

Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest
out by thy great power and by thy stretched out arm .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1396

<P_10,1D> At that time the Lord said unto me , Hew thee two tables of
stone like unto the first , ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1397

and come up unto me into the mount , ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1398

and make thee an ark of wood . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1399

And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables
which thou brakest , ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1400

and thou shalt put them in the ark . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1401

So I made an ark of acacia wood , ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1402

and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1403

and went up into the mount , having the two tables in mine hand .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1404

And he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten
commandments , which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the
midst of the fire in the day of assembly : ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1405

and the Lord gave them unto me . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1406

And I turned ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1407

and came down from the mount , ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1408

and put the tables in the ark which I had made ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1409

and there they be , as the Lord commanded me .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1410

<paren> And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Benejaakan to
Moserah : ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1411

there Aaron died , ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1412

and there he was buried ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1413

and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1414

From thence they journyed unto Gudgodah ; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah
, a land of brooks of water . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1415

At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi , to bear the ark of
the covenant of the Lord , to stand before the Lord to minister unto him
, and to bless in his name , unto this day . Wherefore Levi hath no
portion nor inheritance with his brethren ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1416

the Lord is his inheritance , according as the Lord thy God spake unto
him . <$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1417

And I stayed in the mount , as at the first time , forty days and forty
nights : ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1418

and the Lord hearkened unto me that time also ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1419

the Lord would not destroy thee . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1420

And the Lord said unto me , Arise , ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1421

take thy journey before the people ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1422

and they shall go in and possess the land , which I sware unto their
fathers to give unto them . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1423

And now , Israel , what doth the Lord thy God require of thee , but to
fear the Lord thy God , to walk in all his ways , and to love him , and
to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul , to
keep the commandments of the Lord , and his statutes , which I command
thee this day for thy good ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1424

Behold , unto the Lord thy God belongeth the heaven , and the heaven of
heavens , the earth , with all that therein is .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1425

Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1426

and he chose their seed after them , even you above all peoples , as at
this day . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1427

Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1428

and be no more stiffnecked . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1429

For the Lord your God , he is God of gods , and Lord of lords , the
great God , the mighty , and the terrible , which regardeth not persons
, nor taketh reward . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1430

He doth execute the judgement of the fatherless and the widow ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1431

and loveth the stranger , in giving him food and raiment .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1432

Love ye therefore the stranger : ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1433

for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1434

<P_10,20D> Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1435

him shalt thou serve ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1436

and to him shalt thou cleave , ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1437

and by his name shalt thou swear . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1438

He is thy praise , ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1439

and he is thy God , that hath done for thee these great and terrible
things , which thine eyes have seen . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1440

Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore_and_ten persons ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1441

and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for
multitude . ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1442

<P_11,1D> Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God , and keep his
charge , and his statutes , and his judgements , and his commandments ,
alway . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1443

And know ye this day : ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1444

for <font> I speak <$$font> not with your children which have not known
, and which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God , his
greatness , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arm , and his signs
, and his works , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the
king of Egypt , and unto all his land ; and what he did unto the army of
Egypt , unto their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the
water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and
how the Lord hath destroyed them unto this day : and what he did unto
you in the wilderness , until ye came unto this place ; and what he did
unto Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , the son of Reuben ; how the
earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households ,
and their tents , and every living thing that followed them , in the
midst of all Israel : ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1445

but your eyes have seen all the great work of the Lord which he did .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1446

Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments {TEXT:commandment} which I
command thee this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess
the land , whither ye go over to possess it ; and that ye may prolong
your days upon the land , which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give
unto them and to their seed , a land flowing with milk and honey .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1447

For the land , whither thou goest in to possess it , is not as the land
of Egypt , from whence ye came out , where thou sowedst thy seed , and
wateredst it with thy foot , as a garden of herbs :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1448

but the land , whither ye go over to possess it , is a land of hills and
valleys , <font> ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1449

and <$$font> drinketh water of the rain of heaven : a land which the
Lord thy God careth for ; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1450

the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it , from the beginning of
the year even unto the end of the year . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1451

And it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my
commandments which I command you this day , to love the Lord your God ,
and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul , that I
will give the rain of your land in its season , and the former rain and
the latter rain , that thou mayest gather in thy corn , and thy wine ,
and thine oil . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1452

And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1453

and thou shalt eat and be full . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1454

Take heed to yourselves , lest your heart be deceived , and ye turn
aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ; and the anger of the
Lord be kindled against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be
no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit : and ye perish quickly
from off the good land which the Lord giveth you .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1455

Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul
; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1456

and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand ,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1457

and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1458

And ye shall teach them your children , talking of them , when thou
sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , and when
thou liest down , and when thou risest up . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1459

<P_11,20D> And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house
, and upon thy gates ; that your days may be multiplied , and the days
of your children , upon the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers
to give them , as the days of the heavens above the earth .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1460

For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you
, to do it ; to love the Lord your God , to walk in all his ways , and
to cleave unto him ; then will the Lord drive out all these nations from
before you , ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1461

and ye shall possess nations greater and mightier than yourselves .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1462

Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1463

from the wilderness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates
, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1464

There shall no man be able to stand before you :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1465

the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon
all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath spoken unto you .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1466

Behold , I set before you this day a blessing and a curse ; the blessing
, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of the Lord your God , which
I command you this day : and the curse , if ye shall not hearken unto
the commandments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way
which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have
not known . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1467

And it shall come to pass , when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into
the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt set the
blessing upon mount Gerizim , and the curse upon mount Ebal .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1468

Are they not beyond Jordan , behind the way of the going down of the sun
, in the land of the Canaanites which dwell in the Arabah , over against
Gilgal , beside the oaks of Moreh ? ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1469

For ye are to pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the
Lord your God giveth you , ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1470

and ye shall possess it , and dwell therein .
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1471

And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the judgements which I
set before you this day . ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1472
