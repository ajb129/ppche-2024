Scene , - <font> A fashionably furnished Apartment in Peter Popple's
Villa at Norwood . COYNE-1855-2,3.7

The apartment is semi-circular at the upper end , with three large
French windows opening on the ornamental grounds of the Villa ;
COYNE-1855-2,3.8

a breakfast table laid , <$$font> C. R. ; COYNE-1855-2,3.9

<font> a parrot on a perch at back . <$$font> COYNE-1855-2,3.13

James , <font> a footman , discovered asleep in an easy chair , <$$font>
R. C. ; COYNE-1855-2,3.14

<font> a newspaper lies at his feet . COYNE-1855-2,3.15

Enter <$$font> Mincing , L. D. COYNE-1855-2,3.16

Mincing . James , James . COYNE-1855-2,3.17

Goodness , he@ @'s asleep ! COYNE-1855-2,3.18

<paren> <font> goes to him and calls loudly <$$font> <$$paren> James !
COYNE-1855-2,3.19

James . <paren> <font> starting up <$$font> <$$paren> Hey ! What@ @'s
the matter ? COYNE-1855-2,3.20

Haw - <paren> <font> yawning <$$font> <$$paren> - Mincing , I believe I
was obliverous . COYNE-1855-2,3.21

Mincing . Obliverous ! COYNE-1855-2,3.22

You were fast asleep , James . COYNE-1855-2,3.23

James . Really , the Parliament speeches is so dreadful heavy ,
COYNE-1855-2,3.24

and we were late at the hoprer last night . COYNE-1855-2,3.25

Mincing . Yes , 't@ @was near two o'clock before mistress came home .
COYNE-1855-2,3.26

James . <font> Apropos {TEXT:Aproposs} , <$$font> as we say in the
classics , Mincing , I was quite shocked at a report I heard .
COYNE-1855-2,3.27

Mincing . What report ? COYNE-1855-2,3.28

James . Why , they say we@ @'re <font> parwenews . <$$font>
COYNE-1855-2,3.29

Mincing . <font> Parwenews ! <$$font> Good gracious !
COYNE-1855-2,3.30

James . Is@ @n't it disgusting ? COYNE-1855-2,3.31

Mincing . Dreadful ! COYNE-1855-2,3.32

But are you sure of this , James ? COYNE-1855-2,3.33

James . Sure ! COYNE-1855-2,3.34

Sir William Fluke's tiger pledged his honor it was a fact !
COYNE-1855-2,3.35

Mincing . Oh , if Sir William's tiger pledged his honor , there can be
no doubt about it . COYNE-1855-2,3.36

James . I always suspected Mr. Popples since I see him eat green peas
with his knife . COYNE-1855-2,3.37

Mincing . Hush , here he comes . COYNE-1855-2,3.38

<font> Exit <$$font> James , L. D. COYNE-1855-2,3.39

<font> Enter <$$font> Popples <font> from room , R. , COYNE-1855-2,3.40

he casts a glance at breakfast table , COYNE-1855-2,3.41

and looks at his watch . <$$font> COYNE-1855-2,3.42

Pop. Mistress not down yet , Mincing ? COYNE-1855-2,3.43

Mincing . Not yet , sir ; COYNE-1855-2,3.44

but she@ @'ll be here presently . <font> Exit , <$$font> L.
COYNE-1855-2,3.45

Pop. Twelve o'clock , and not down to breakfast yet .
COYNE-1855-2,3.46

A few months ago , when I was a happy doll maker , she used to rise with
<P_4> the lark - that is , not exactly with the lark , for larks do@
@n't rise in Mile End - but with the earliest sparrow in the
neighbourhood ; COYNE-1855-2,4.47

but ever since I came into this unlucky fortune , her poor little head
has been turned , COYNE-1855-2,4.48

and nothing will serve but I must take a country villa , and give up my
shop , and my dolls , and my old friends ; and eat , drink , sleep , and
dress as she pleases - because , as she says , it@ @'s fashionable .
COYNE-1855-2,4.49

<paren> Mrs. Popples <font> is heard laughing outside . <$$font> L.
<$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,4.50

There she is at last , COYNE-1855-2,4.51

bless her dear merry laugh - COYNE-1855-2,4.52

it reminds me of the happy days when she was@ @n't afraid to be natural
. COYNE-1855-2,4.53

<font> Enter <$$font> Mrs. Popples , L. , <font> in an elegant morning
costume , COYNE-1855-2,4.54

she is followed by <$$font> Alphonse . COYNE-1855-2,4.55

Mrs. P. Ah , my dear Poppy , how d'@ @ye do ? COYNE-1855-2,4.56

Coffee , Alphonse . <paren> <font> sits at table , <$$font> L.
<$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,4.57

Been up long , my love ? COYNE-1855-2,4.58

Pop. Since six o'clock , my dear . <paren> <font> sits at table
<$$font> , R. <$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,4.59

Mrs. P. Six ! COYNE-1855-2,4.60

Mercy on me , how have you contrived to amuse yourself all this time ?
COYNE-1855-2,4.61

<paren> Alphonse , <font> who has poured out coffee , hands it to
<$$font> Mrs. Popples <$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,4.62

Pop. A - hem - <paren> <font> embarrassed <$$font> <$$paren> For the
first three hours , I watched the gold fish wagging their little tails
in the glass globe ; COYNE-1855-2,4.63

but the study of natural history becoming tiresome , I turned my
attention to passing events COYNE-1855-2,4.64

and counted the cabs and shays on the road . COYNE-1855-2,4.65

Mrs. P. Chaises , my love . COYNE-1855-2,4.66

Pop. Well chayzes - COYNE-1855-2,4.67

it@ @'s all the same , COYNE-1855-2,4.68

only you@ @'re so particular with your French , because you spent twelve
months with your aunt , the schoolmistress , at Boulogne .
COYNE-1855-2,4.69

Mrs. P. Ha , ha , ha , ha ! - You@ @'re delightfully droll .
COYNE-1855-2,4.70

You may go , Alphonse - ha , ha , ha ! COYNE-1855-2,4.71

<paren> Alphonse <font> is going <$$font> <$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,4.72

Pop. And , Alphonse , here ! <paren> <font> returns to <$$font> C.
<$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,4.73

I do@ @n't want you ! <font> Exit <$$font> Alphonse , L.
COYNE-1855-2,4.74

Mrs. P. Ha , ha , ha ! <paren> <font> Changing her tone <$$font>
<$$paren> Popples , why will you expose yourself and me in this manner ,
before your domestics ? COYNE-1855-2,4.75

You forget that our position in life is not now what it once was .
COYNE-1855-2,4.76

Pop. I have a painful conviction of the fact . COYNE-1855-2,4.77

I@ @'ll take a cup of tea , my dear . COYNE-1855-2,4.78

<paren> <font> she pours out tea <$$font> <$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,4.79

Mrs. P. You ought to be the happiest man in existence .
COYNE-1855-2,4.80

Blessed with an ample fortune - Pop. Which I do@ @n't know how to spend
. COYNE-1855-2,4.81

Mrs. P. My love , I@ @'ll do that for you . COYNE-1855-2,4.82

You live in an elegant villa at Norwood - COYNE-1855-2,4.83

Pop. I do@ @n't like it - COYNE-1855-2,4.84

I was more comfortable at Mile End . COYNE-1855-2,4.85

There@ @'s too much fresh air going to waste here ; COYNE-1855-2,4.86

it@ @'s a shameful expenditure of nature's property . COYNE-1855-2,4.87

<paren> Mrs. Popples <font> hands him a cup of tea <$$font> <$$paren>
Thank you , my dear . COYNE-1855-2,4.88

Mrs. P. Then you have a host of friends who are all sincerely attached
to you . COYNE-1855-2,4.89

Pop. I know it ; COYNE-1855-2,4.90

attached to me , and to my dinners ; COYNE-1855-2,4.91

attached to my old wines , and my young - hem - COYNE-1855-2,4.92

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> I@ @'ll not say that -
COYNE-1855-2,4.93

attached to my fortune , COYNE-1855-2,4.94

and like caterpillars they@ @'ll stick to the tree while there@ @'s a
leaf left on it to devour . COYNE-1855-2,4.95

<P_5>

Mrs. P. Ridiculous ! COYNE-1855-2,5.97

<paren> <font> he pours his tea from his cup into the slop basin
<$$font> <$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,5.98

Why do@ @n't you drink your tea from the cup , my dear ?
COYNE-1855-2,5.99

Pop. Because I like it better from a bowl , my dear -
COYNE-1855-2,5.100

you remember I always had my tea in a bowl when I made dolls at Mile End
. COYNE-1855-2,5.101

Mrs. P. I wish you would try and forget Mile End and your dolls , Mr.
Popples . COYNE-1855-2,5.102

Pop. That@ @'s impossible , Mrs. Popples - morally impossible .
COYNE-1855-2,5.103

I can never forget the lovely creatures , with their soft flaxen hair
curling round their little pink cheeks , and those beautiful blue eyes
turning all manner of ways , that bring tears to mine when I think of
them . COYNE-1855-2,5.104

Forget my dolls ! COYNE-1855-2,5.105

No , Mrs. Popples , I trust I have the feelings of a doll maker too
strong in my bosom , ever to forget the sweet smiling innocents that
owed their existence to these hands . COYNE-1855-2,5.106

Mrs. P. Well , my dear , I only hope you will suppress your feelings
in the presence of our aristocratic friends , who are coming to spend a
few days with us . COYNE-1855-2,5.107

Pop. What , move ? COYNE-1855-2,5.108

Why the house will be full of them : COYNE-1855-2,5.109

they swarm to it like blue-bottles to a pastry cook's window in the dog
days , COYNE-1855-2,5.110

and nearly drive me mad . COYNE-1855-2,5.111

Mrs. P. How strangely tastes differ . COYNE-1855-2,5.112

For my part , I like the excitement of a house full of company -
COYNE-1855-2,5.113

nature , I suppose , formed me for fashionable life .
COYNE-1855-2,5.114

Pop. Do@ @n't blame nature , Polly : COYNE-1855-2,5.115

- nature formed you for a good sensible little wife , COYNE-1855-2,5.116

but art has well nigh spoiled you . COYNE-1855-2,5.117

Nature never taught you to turn day-light into wax-light , to risk your
money at a card table , or to lose your complexion at night in a ball
room , and buy a fresh one in the morning at a perfumer's .
COYNE-1855-2,5.118

Mrs. P. <paren> <font> laughing <$$font> <$$paren> I protest , Popples
, COYNE-1855-2,5.119

you wrong me about my complexion . COYNE-1855-2,5.120

As yet , I have not been obliged to mend my damaged charms by art like
Lady Oldham , who spends the morning stuccoing and patching her face ,
and comes out in the evening like one of those repaired portraits one
sees in a picture cleaner's window , where they write up , " Heads
restored in this style . " COYNE-1855-2,5.121

Pop. Will you listen to me seriously . Mrs. Popples ? <paren> <font>
rises <$$font> <$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,5.122

Mrs. P. <paren> <font> rises <$$font> <$$paren> Not to day , my dear -
COYNE-1855-2,5.123

I want to be in my best spirits to meet my friends . COYNE-1855-2,5.124

Come , come , COYNE-1855-2,5.125

there@ @'s a dear Poppy . COYNE-1855-2,5.126

<font> Faisons la paix et embrassez moi mon cher . <$$font> <paren>
<font> kisses him <$$font> <$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,5.127

You@ @'ll be amiable , wo@ @n't you ? COYNE-1855-2,5.128

Pop. Well , I suppose I must - COYNE-1855-2,5.129

these are arguments that no man can resist . COYNE-1855-2,5.130

I@ @'m sorry though they@ @'re coming to-day , COYNE-1855-2,5.131

for I expect a visitor who may not perhaps be the sort of person who -
COYNE-1855-2,5.132

Mrs. P. A visitor - COYNE-1855-2,5.133

who is it ? COYNE-1855-2,5.134

Pop. Our old friend Skrymsher - Sam Skrymsher from Lincolnshire .
COYNE-1855-2,5.135

Mrs. P. What , Skrymsher , that vulgar creature ? COYNE-1855-2,5.136

Oh , Popples , how could you ? COYNE-1855-2,5.137

- what will our friends say ? COYNE-1855-2,5.138

Do contrive some plan to keep him out of the way - COYNE-1855-2,5.139

or , better , if you were to let him perceive that his visit is not
agreeable , that he is <font> de trop <$$font> . COYNE-1855-2,5.140

Pop. What , give the cold shoulder to Sam Skrymsher ?
COYNE-1855-2,5.141

No , Polly , I@ @'ll be hanged if I do that . COYNE-1855-2,5.142

I ca@ @n't forget that he was my best friend when I wanted one , that he
lent me three_hundred <P_6> pounds when we married to set up in business
, and that he used to send us up the fattest goose in Lincolnshire , and
buy the biggest doll in my shop every Christmas . COYNE-1855-2,6.143

Do@ @n't ask me to cut such a man . COYNE-1855-2,6.144

Mrs. P. There , that@ @'s the way you perpetually oppose my wishes ,
COYNE-1855-2,6.145

it@ @'s plain you do@ @n't care for me . COYNE-1855-2,6.146

I have lost your affections , COYNE-1855-2,6.147

you do@ @n't love me any longer . COYNE-1855-2,6.148

Pop. My darling Polly , you know - COYNE-1855-2,6.149

Mrs. P. I know I am an unhappy woman . COYNE-1855-2,6.150

Reach me a chair . COYNE-1855-2,6.151

Oh ! <font> Vous m'avez blessé au coeur - je sens que j'evanourai
<$$font> . COYNE-1855-2,6.152

Pop. <paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> Now she@ @'s got to her
French entrenchments she@ @'ll give me no quarter . <paren> <font>
places a chair <$$font> C. , <font> she sits <$$font> <$$paren>
COYNE-1855-2,6.153

Mrs. P. I feel I shall have one of my nervous attacks .
COYNE-1855-2,6.154

Pop. Pray do@ @n't ! my angel , COYNE-1855-2,6.155

do@ @n't ! COYNE-1855-2,6.156

I can stand any attack from a woman but a nervous one .
COYNE-1855-2,6.157

There now , COYNE-1855-2,6.158

do@ @n't go off , and I@ @'ll do whatever you wish . COYNE-1855-2,6.159

I@ @'ll look at Sam , when he comes , as fiercely as the lion looks at
the unicorn in the royal arms . COYNE-1855-2,6.160

Will that do ? COYNE-1855-2,6.161

Mrs. P. <paren> <font> recovering , rises <$$font> <$$paren> Thanks ,

Pop. You do@ @n't know my sufferings , trying to get through the day

Skrym. Nothing irregular I hope , Peter ? COYNE-1855-2,7.228

Pop. Oh dear no ! COYNE-1855-2,7.229

Polly reigns sole mistress of the little tenement inside my waistcoat -
COYNE-1855-2,7.230

but there is a secret which I@ @'ll confide to you , Sam .
COYNE-1855-2,7.231

You must know that Mrs. P. ca@ @n't abide the sight of a doll ,
COYNE-1855-2,7.232

the very mention of one makes her ill , lest people , as she says ,
should suspect the fact of my having been a doll maker .
COYNE-1855-2,7.233

Skrym. Bah ! A weak woman ! COYNE-1855-2,7.234

Pop. Yes ; but the weakest of them are too strong for us , Sam .
COYNE-1855-2,7.235

Skrym. Perhaps so - COYNE-1855-2,7.236

ca@ @n't say as I never speculated in the article . COYNE-1855-2,7.237

Go on . COYNE-1855-2,7.238

Pop. Now in this respect I do@ @n't at all coincide with Mrs. P.
COYNE-1855-2,7.239

- I@ @'m an enthusiast in dolls , COYNE-1855-2,7.240

I@ @'ve made them and lived among them all my life , COYNE-1855-2,7.241

and I do@ @n't mind confessing that my earliest love was for a splendid
wax doll , with joints and turning eyes : COYNE-1855-2,7.242

- she was sent to Russia , Sam , COYNE-1855-2,7.243

and I afterwards married Polly , because she was like that doll .
COYNE-1855-2,7.244

Skrym. Well , but the secret ? COYNE-1855-2,7.245

Pop. I@ @'m coming to it . COYNE-1855-2,7.246

I@ @'ve had a notion for a long time , that a great improvement might be
made in the construction of dolls , COYNE-1855-2,7.247

so as I had nothing better to do , I set to work in that room , <paren>
<font> points to <$$font> R. <$$paren> of which I keep the key ,
COYNE-1855-2,7.248

and every hour that I can manage to steal away , I employ making a model
doll that will astonish the world . COYNE-1855-2,7.249

Skrym. You think so ? COYNE-1855-2,7.250

Pop. I@ @'m certain of it . COYNE-1855-2,7.251

By a curious complication of springs and bellows , I can make it imitate
the human voice , COYNE-1855-2,7.252

and already it calls " mamma , " in the sweetest infantine tone you ever
heard . COYNE-1855-2,7.253

Skrym. Nonsense - you@ @'re losing your wits , Peter -
COYNE-1855-2,7.254

you@ @'ve run doll mad . COYNE-1855-2,7.255

Pop. Ah , you think it@ @'s impossible , COYNE-1855-2,7.256

but come with me and you <P_8> shall judge for yourself ;
COYNE-1855-2,8.257

you shall see it , Sam - COYNE-1855-2,8.258

I@ @'ll show you how it works . COYNE-1855-2,8.259

Skrym. Ay ! Well it must be curious . COYNE-1855-2,8.260

You always had a wonderful head - COYNE-1855-2,8.261

but do@ @n't you think a little refreshment might be agreeable at the
same time ? COYNE-1855-2,8.262

Pop. Refreshment - ah , to be sure ! COYNE-1855-2,8.263

I forgot that you have had a ride from town . COYNE-1855-2,8.264

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> A thought strikes me ;
COYNE-1855-2,8.265

I@ @'ll try to keep him in the doll room till my wife's fashionable
company have left . COYNE-1855-2,8.266

I say , Skrymsher , as Mrs. P. do@ @n't dine till six , what do you
say to an early bit of dinner to ourselves in my room , amongst the
dolls , eh ? snug and quiet , eh ? COYNE-1855-2,8.267

nobody to disturb us - and a comfortable pipe afterwards , eh ?
COYNE-1855-2,8.268

Skrym. The very thing I@ @'d like ; COYNE-1855-2,8.269

none of those fellows with a top dressing of flour upon their heads ,
standing behind our chairs . COYNE-1855-2,8.270

Pop. Nothing of the kind - perfectly private , COYNE-1855-2,8.271

nobody is ever permitted to set foot in that room but myself .
COYNE-1855-2,8.272

You go in , Sam , COYNE-1855-2,8.273
