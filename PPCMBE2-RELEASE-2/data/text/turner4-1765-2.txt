My brother quite ashamed of his last night's behaviour ;
TURNER4-1765-2,315.14

kept his bed all day , TURNER4-1765-2,315.15

and may the Supreme Being give and endue him with his preventing grace ,
strength and resolution of mind enough never to be guilty of drunkenness
again . TURNER4-1765-2,315.16

TURNER4-1765-2,317.43

We came back about 8.10 . TURNER4-1765-2,317.44

This is a girl which I have taken a great liking to , she seeming to all
appearances to be a girl endued with a great deal of good nature and
good sense , TURNER4-1765-2,317.45

and withal so far as has hitherto come to my knowledge is very discreet
and prudent . TURNER4-1765-2,317.46

I also supped there on some rashers of bacon . TURNER4-1765-2,317.53

It being an excessive wet and windy night I had the opportunity - sure I
should say the pleasure , or perhaps some might say the unspeakable
happiness - to sit up with Molly Hicks , or my charmer , all night .
TURNER4-1765-2,317.54

I came home about 5.40 in the morn , I must not say fatigued
TURNER4-1765-2,317.55

- No ! No ! that could not be . TURNER4-1765-2,317.56

It could be only a little sleepy for want of rest .
TURNER4-1765-2,317.57

Well to be sure she is a most clever girl , TURNER4-1765-2,317.58

jointly between them . TURNER4-1765-2,317.65

accident , as it should appear , though by them a contrived thing ,
spent the even with me till about 10.20 . TURNER4-1765-2,318.70

My friend Joseph Fuller I must own is rather too fruitful in his
invention to contrive some way to get a little liquor or a pipe or two
of tobacco . TURNER4-1765-2,318.71

In the even very dull and sleepy ; TURNER4-1765-2,318.80

this courting does not well agree with my constitution ,
TURNER4-1765-2,318.81

After dinner I set out for Malling to pay Molly Hicks my intended wife a

TURNER4-1765-2,318.101

But there was no afternoon service there . TURNER4-1765-2,318.102

<paren> My brother and servant at church in the afternoon <$$paren> .
{COM:order_of_punctuation_sic} TURNER4-1765-2,318.103

I spent the afternoon with a great deal of pleasure , it being very fine
pleasant weather and my companion very agreeable .
TURNER4-1765-2,318.104

I drank tea with her TURNER4-1765-2,318.105

and came home about 9.30 . TURNER4-1765-2,318.106

Spent today 8@ @d. : <font> viz. <$$font> , turnpike 2@ @d. and the
servant 6@ @d. TURNER4-1765-2,318.107

Now perhaps there may be many reports abroad in the world of my present
intentions , some likely comdemning , other approving my choice .
TURNER4-1765-2,318.108

But as the world can@ @not judge the secret intentions of my mind and I
may therefore be censured for want of knowing the true motives of my
proceedings , I will take the trouble to relate what are really and
truly my intentions and the only motive from which they spring <paren>
which may be some satisfaction to those who may happen to peruse my
memoirs <$$paren> . {COM:order_of_punctuation_sic}
TURNER4-1765-2,318.109

To do the first I shall begin with the latter , as thinking it most
necessary ; TURNER4-1765-2,318.110

and as to the motives which spur me on to think of marriage , first I
think it <P_319> in a state agreeable to nature , reason and religion
and in some manner the indispensable duty of Christians .
TURNER4-1765-2,319.111

For I think it is the duty of every Christian to serve God and perform
his religious services in the most calm , serene and composed manner ,
which if it can be performed more so in a married state than in a single
one , it must then be an indispensable duty . TURNER4-1765-2,319.112

Now as to my own present situation , my house is not at all regular ,
TURNER4-1765-2,319.113

neither is there any family devotion performed in that serious manner as
formerly in my wife's time , TURNER4-1765-2,319.114

nor have I one friend in the world ; TURNER4-1765-2,319.115

that is , I have not anyone whom I can thoroughly rely upon or confide
in . TURNER4-1765-2,319.116

Neither have I anyone to trust the management of my affairs to that I
can be assured in their management will be sustained no loss .
TURNER4-1765-2,319.117

I have not one agreeable companion to soften and alleviate the
misfortunes incident to human nature . TURNER4-1765-2,319.118

As to my choice I have only this to say : TURNER4-1765-2,319.119

the girl I believe as far as I can discover is a very industrious ,
sober woman and seemingly endued with prudence and good nature , and
seems to have a very serious and sedate turn of mind .
TURNER4-1765-2,319.120

She comes of reputable parents TURNER4-1765-2,319.121

and may perhaps one time or other have some fortune .
TURNER4-1765-2,319.122

As to her person I know it@ @'s plain <paren> so is my own <$$paren> ,
TURNER4-1765-2,319.123

but she is cleanly in her person and dress <paren> which I will say is
something more than at first sight it may appear to be towards happiness
<$$paren> . TURNER4-1765-2,319.124

She is I think a well-made woman . TURNER4-1765-2,319.125

As to her education , I own is not liberal , TURNER4-1765-2,319.126

neither do I think it equals my own , TURNER4-1765-2,319.127

but she has good sense and a seeming desire to improve her mind ,
TURNER4-1765-2,319.128

and , I must in justice say , has always behaved to me with the
strictest honour and good manners , her behaviour being far from the
affected formality of the prude , nor on the other hand anything of that
foolish fondness too often found in the more light part of the sex .
TURNER4-1765-2,319.129

Now for my real intentions : it is that of marriage and of the strictest
honour , having nothing else in view but to live in a more sober and
regular manner , and to be better able to perform my duty to God and man
in a more suitable and truly religious manner , and with the grace of
the Supreme Being to live happy and in a sincere union with the partner
of my bosom . TURNER4-1765-2,319.130

done it unto me , ' from which words we had a very good sermon , the
theological part being sound divinity and treated on in a very pretty
manner , TURNER4-1765-2,320.162

and the application to the discourse relating to the society was
excellent , being concise and very much to the purpose .

An excessive hot day . TURNER4-1765-2,323.333

<font> Weds. 31 July <$$font> . TURNER4-1765-2,323.334

From the day last mentioned , I have been so embarrassed with a
multiplicity of business that I was not able to continue my journal ,
being on the 19th day of June married at our church <paren> to Mary
Hicks , servant to Luke Spence Esq. of South Malling <$$paren> by the
Rev. Mr. Porter , TURNER4-1765-2,323.335

and for about 14 days was very ill with a tertian ague , or rather an
intermitting fever . TURNER4-1765-2,323.336

Then the ceremony of receiving visitors and again the returning of them
has indeed , together with the business in my trade , taken up so much
of my time that I was obliged to omit that which would have given me the
greatest pleasure imaginable to have continued . TURNER4-1765-2,323.337

But however thank God I begin once more to be a little settled
TURNER4-1765-2,323.338

and am happy in my choice . TURNER4-1765-2,323.339

I have , it@ @'s true , not married a learned lady ,
TURNER4-1765-2,323.340

nor is she a gay one , TURNER4-1765-2,323.341

but I trust she is goodnatured , and one that will use her utmmost
endeavour to make me happy , which perhaps is as much as it is in the
power of a wife to do . TURNER4-1765-2,323.342

As to her fortune , I shall one day have something considerable ,
TURNER4-1765-2,323.343

and there seems to be rather a flowing stream . TURNER4-1765-2,323.344

Well , here let us drop the subject and begin a new one .
