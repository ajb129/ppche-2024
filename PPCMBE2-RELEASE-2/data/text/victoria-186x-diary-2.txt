VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.8

- Have been unable to write my Journal since the day my beloved one left
us , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.9

and with what a heavy broken heart I enter on a new year without him !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.10

My dreadful and overwhelming calamity gives me so much to do , that I
must henceforth merely keep notes of my sad and solitary life .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.11

This day last year found us so perfectly happy ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.12

and now ! VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.13

Last year music woke us ; VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.14

little gifts , new year's wishes , brought in by maid , and then given
to dearest Albert , the children waiting with their gifts in the next
room - all these recollections were pouring in on my mind in an
overpowering manner . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.15

Alice slept in my room , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.16

and dear baby came down early . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.17

Felt as if living in a dreadful dream . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.18

Dear Alice much affected when she got up and kissed me .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.19

Arthur gave me a nosegay , and the girls , drawings done by them for
their dear father and me . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.20

Could hardly touch my breakfast . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.21

When dressed saw Dr. Jenner , Mr. Ruland , and Augusta Bruce .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,4.22

Went down to see the sketch for a statue of my beloved Albert in
Highland dress , <P_1,5> which promises to be good .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,5.23

Then out with Lenchen , Toward always following and pointing out trees
and everything . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,5.24

When I came in , saw the Duke of Newcastle in dear Albert's room , where
<font> all <$$font> remains the same . Talking for long of him , of his
great goodness , and purity , quite unlike anyone else .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,5.25

Saw Sir J. Clark , Sir C. Phipps , and then dear , kind Uncle Leopold
. VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,5.26

Dined with dear Marie VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,5.27

and went over to Feodore's room . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,5.28

Dear Uncle came upstairs to see me for a short while , also Bertie .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,5.29

so sad . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,5.30

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.33

- Held a Council , which was well and kindly arranged .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.34

Lord Granville and others , with Mr. Helps , were in dear Albert's room
, and I in mine , with the door open . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.35

The business was all summed up in two paragraphs ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.36

and Mr. Helps read " approved " for me . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.37

This was unlike anything which had been done before .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.38

The Council after dear Mama died took place in the Red Room ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.39

and dearest Albert handed me the papers VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.40

and was with me . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.41

But now ! VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.42

Saw Lord Granville for some time , who was much affected and could
hardly speak . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.43

We talked of my beloved one ; of the terrible fatal illness ; of the
Memorials , which will be numberless . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.44

One is to be raised by both Houses of Parliament , and the great
National one . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.45

Dear Feodore dined with me VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,6.46

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,12.52

- The expressions of universal admiration and appreciation of beloved
Albert are most striking , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,12.53

and show how he was beloved and how his worth was recognised .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,12.54

Even the poor people in small villages , who do@ @n't know me , are
shedding tears for me , as if it were their own private sorrow .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,12.55

Saw General Grey and then Lord Elgin , who goes as Governor-General to
India . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,12.56

We talked of India . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,12.57

General Grey was to show him the papers with my beloved Albert's views
on India , in which he took so great an interest , as in all that
concerned it . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,12.58

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.62

- After luncheon saw Lord Palmerston <paren> who has been very ill
<$$paren> . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.63

It made me very nervous seeing him for the first time since my great
misfortune , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.64

but I felt it was right not to put it off any longer .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.65

He seemed very nervous himself . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.66

Spoke of Uncle , whom he had been to see , and of my remaining here for
the present . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.67

He could in fact hardly speak for emotion .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.68

It showed me how much he felt my terrible loss ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.69

and he said what a dreadful calamity it was .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.70

Then he spoke about Bertie , and the desirability for his travelling ,
which would be such a good thing for him .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.71

I repeated that it had been his Father's wish he should do so ;
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.72

and Lord Palmerston said it was most important he should marry .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.73

I observed that he was a very good and dutiful son , but that for him ,
just at his age , the loss of his Father was terrible , which Lord
Palmerston thoroughly understands and feels keenly .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.74

Everything was quiet , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.75

he thought there would be no trouble , but " <font> the <$$font>
difficulty of the moment " was Bertie . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.76

I felt the same , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,14.77

<P_1,15>

and would hardly have given Lord Palmerston credit for entering so
entirely into my anxieties . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,15.79

He alluded to Princess Alexandra VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,15.80

and thought the political objections must not be minded , as they did
not affect <font> this <$$font> country . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,15.81

I did not speak as if there were any certainty ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,15.82

but praised the young lady . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,15.83

With America he hoped matters would go well .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,15.84

He was most anxious to facilitate things for me .

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,26.89

- Saw Sir C. Phipps , who had been speaking with Mr. Gladstone about
money matters , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,26.90

I feel very anxious about a provision for Bertie and his wife , in the
event of his marrying ; a provision for my younger sons on their coming
of age and marrying ; and a provision for the younger children under age
, in case of my death . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,26.91

He showed me a very satisfactory paper from Mr. Gladstone on the
subject . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,26.92

Then saw Mr. Gladstone for a little while , who was very kind and
feeling . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,26.93

We talked of the state of the country . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,26.94

He spoke with such unbounded admiration and appreciation of my beloved
Albert , saying no one could ever replace him :

- I went down to see Tennyson , who is very peculiar-looking , tall ,
dark , with a fine head , long black flowing hair , and a beard ; oddly
dressed , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,30.101

but there is no affectation about him . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,30.102

I told him how much I admired his glorious lines to my precious Albert ,
and how much comfort I found in his <font> In Memoriam . <$$font>
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,30.103

He was full of unbounded appreciation of beloved Albert .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,30.104

When he spoke of my own loss , of that to the nation , his eyes quite
filled with tears . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,30.105

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,33.109

- Held a Council , at which an Order in Council was passed , making the
signature <bracket> by me <$$bracket> of the first commission in the
Army sufficient , without <font> each <$$font> one being signed singly .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,33.110

This , beloved Albert had always wished should be done ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,33.111

and , now that I am so busy , it is absolutely necessary .

- Heard of Bertie's landing , after a boisterous crossing .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.116

The good General none the worse for it . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.117

Bertie arrived at half past five , looking extremely well .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.118

I was much upset at seeing him , and feeling his beloved father was not
there to welcome him back . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.119

He would have been so pleased to see him so improved , and looking so
bright and healthy . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.120

Dear Bertie was most affectionate , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.121

and the tears came into his eyes when he saw me .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.122

Drove with Alice and Augusta Bruce {TEXT:B} .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.123

Saw Sir C. Phipps , who had seen General Bruce , and said he required
the greatest quiet , and was hardly to be recognised with his white
beard , so thin and haggard , and not able to walk alone .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.124

After dinner saw good Dr. Minter , who gave me an account of Bertie ,
and of the General's illness . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.125

Then Dr. Stanley came , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.126

and I thanked him for all he had done for our boy .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.127

He was so kind and full of sympathy , which I shall not easily forget .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.128

He Spoke most kindly of Bertie , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.129

and thanked me for having asked his sister here to meet him .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.130

Remained some time talking with him . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,34.131

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.135

- Scarcely got any sleep . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.136

Towards morning heard all the preparations for to-day's ceremony going
on . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.137

It tried me terribly . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.138

Alice got up VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.139

and came VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.140

and kissed me , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.141

and I gave her my blessing and a Prayer Book , like one dear Mama gave
me on <font> our <$$font> happy wedding morning .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.142

Went with Col. Biddulph to look at the Dining-room , which was very
prettily decorated , the altar being placed under our large family
picture . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.143

All the furniture had been removed , and plants and flowers placed
everywhere ... VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.144

The time had come , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.145

and I , in my " sad cap , " as baby calls it , most sad on such a day ,
went down with our four boys , Bertie and Affie leading me .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.146

It was a terrible moment for me . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.147

No one was in the room but the Archbishop of York <paren> the Archbishop
of Canterbury not being well enough to come <$$paren> , the Dean of
Windsor , and Mr. Prothero , who were in their places near the altar .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.148

Then all the guests came in , and the different Households .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.149

I sat all the time in an armchair , Bertie and Affie close to me .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.150

The Hessian family stood opposite , Clementine , Augustus , and Nemours
next to them . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.151

After a short pause Louis came in , conducted by Lord Sydney , and
followed by his two brothers William and Henry .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.152

After another pause came the dear dear Bride on her Uncle's arm ,
followed by the Bridesmaids , a touching sight .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.153

The service then commenced , the Archbishop performing it beautifully .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.154

Alice answered so distinctly VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.155

and was full of dignity and self-possession .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.156

Louis also answered very distinctly . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.157

I restrained my tears , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.158

and had a great struggle all through , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.159

but remained calm . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,40.160

- At half past 1 went down to luncheon with the girls , going first to
the Drawing-room where Marie Brabant {TEXT:B} and Mrs. Paget introduced
Princess Christian , who presented her two daughters Alexandra and
Dagmar , and Prince Christian . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.165

I had seen him last twenty-four years ago .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.166

The Brabants and Philip were also there .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.167

Alexandra is lovely , such a beautiful refined profile , and quiet
ladylike manner , which made a most favourable impression .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.168

Dagmar is quite different , with fine brown eyes .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.169

Princess Christian must have been quite good-looking .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.170

She is unfortunately very deaf . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.171

Uncle soon came in , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.172

and after a rather stiff visit they all <paren> excepting myself
<$$paren> went to luncheon . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.173

I spoke to Mrs. Paget in the next room VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.174

and told her I was favourably impressed .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.175

Baby lunched with me . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.176

Afterwards Marie B. brought Prince and Princess Christian upstairs ,
leaving them with me . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.177

Now came the terribly trying moment for me .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.178

<font> I <$$font> had <font> alone <$$font> to say and do what , under
other , former happy circumstances , had devolved on us both together .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.179

It was not without much emotion that I was able to express what I did to
the Princess : my belief that they knew what we wished and hoped , which
was terrible for me to say <font> alone . <$$font>
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.180

I said that I trusted their dear daughter would feel , should she accept
our son , that she was doing so with her whole heart and will .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,43.181

They assured me that Bertie <font> might hope <$$font> she would do so ,
and that they trusted <font> he <$$font> also felt a real inclination ,
adding that they hoped God would give their dear child strength to do
what she ought , and that she might be able to pour some comfort into my
poor <P_1,44> heart , that they were sure she would become quickly
attached to me , and be a good wife to Bertie .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.182

I replied I would do all I could to be a <font> real <$$font> mother to
her , but I feared she was entering a very sad house .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.183

Thus ended this most trying meeting . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.184

Feodore after-wards came to my room VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.185

and I told her all . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.186

She spoke with great admiration of the young Princess .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.187

Dined as yesterday , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.188

and afterwards Prince and Princess Christian and princess Alexandra came
upstairs . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.189

She looked lovely , in a black dress , nothing in her hair , and curls
on either side , which hung over her shoulders , her hair turned back
off her beautiful forehead . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.190

Her whole appearance was one of the greatest charm , combined with
simplicity and perfect dignity . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.191

I gave her a little piece of white heather , which Bertie gave me at
Balmoral , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.192

and I told her I hoped it would bring her luck .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.193

Dear Uncle Leopold , who sat near me , was charmed with her .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.194

Very tired , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.195

and talked of Bertie's marriage , of France , Germany , and the
Schleswig-Holstein question . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.200

We discussed the importance of Bertie's marriage being in <font> no
<$$font> sense considered a <font> political <$$font> one .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.201

Had a telegram from Bertie , which shortly afterwards General Grey sent
back deciphered , to the effect that he " had proposed and been accepted
this day , " and asking " for my consent and blessing . "
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.202

So it <font> is <$$font> settled . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,44.203

Heard two days ago that the King of Prussia wished to come and see me
for a few hours . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.212

He arrived this morning at 6 , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.213

and at half past 9 , as soon as I was dressed , I saw him in my room .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.214

He was very much affected , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.215

and was most kind , evidently much moved at seeing me .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.216

He did not allude to politics , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.217

only said , with tears in his eyes , how much he felt the weight of his
position . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.218

He breakfasted with me and the two girls , the other children being in
the room . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.219

Drove up to the Festung , the King , myself , Alexandrine , and Lenchen
. VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.220

He was enchanted with everything and enormously struck with the
magnificent view from the bastion . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.221

and felt very nervous and anxious . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.227

Then Lord Palmerston and Lord Stanley <bracket> of Alderley <$$bracket>
, with Mr. Helps , came into dear Albert's room ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,45.228

and I read <P_1,46> with a trembling voice the declaration of Bertie's
marriage , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.229

and approved of three matters . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.230

They had shortened the business for me , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.231

but still , short as it was , I found it very trying .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.232

The children were quite distressed at my pale face , when I came down to
luncheon . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.233

<font> 5th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} Nov. <$$font> -
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.234

News came at quarter to 8 that the <font> Black Eagle <$$font> was in
sight . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.235

It was still foggy , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.236

but moonlight , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.237

and various rockets and signals had been decided on .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.238

The children were greatly excited . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.239

Lenchen and Leopold went down , the only representatives of our family ,
and that poor little boy the only Prince of the family .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.240

Oh ! how terribly I felt the contrast with former days and now ! !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.241

Took some soup VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.242

and waited a long time with Louise and Beatrice downstairs .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.243

At last , at 9 , dear Alexandra arrived with her father , looking very
lovely and well . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.244

A gleam of satisfaction for a moment shone into my heart as I led "
<font> our <$$font> " future daughter upstairs to her room .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.245

The event I had so fondly , eagerly , looked forward to for years ,
feeling it would be <font> such <$$font> a joy in comparison to the
weddings of our daughters , and the sorrow of parting with them , was
now really coming to pass . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.246

How I realised this as I clasped dear Alix in my arms !

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.248

Saw Sir Charles Wood VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.249

and showed him some drafts of Lord Russell's , together with my answer ,
explaining that he had not shown <font> one <$$font> of them to the
Cabinet . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.250

Pointed out the foolishness of the system pursued with such bad results
, in constantly irritating France about Italy , which I had desired
should not be done . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.251

<font> 16th {COM:font_change_excludes_numerals} Nov. <$$font> -
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.252

Saw Lord Granville VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.253

and had a long conversation with him on the various points I had
mentioned to Sir Charles Wood , regarding Lord Russell not having shown
the despatches properly . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.254

Lord Granville advised my saying and doing nothing further on the
subject now . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,46.255

Saw Sir Charles Wood later , who urged me <font> not <$$font> to call
upon the Cabinet for support , excepting when I disapproved of the
<P_1,47> policy pursued , which I assured him I should never do , unless
I could not possibly avoid it . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,47.256

I said I felt bound to watch that no objectionable despatches should be
sent . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,47.257

Upon the whole Lord Russell had very been amenable to reason , up to
these last two despatches . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,47.258

<font> 9th {COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} Dec. <$$font> 1862 .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,51.263

- Saw Lord Russell , who talked of Bertie's Marriage Treaty , then of
the very important decision of the Cabinet to recommend me to give up
the Protectorate of the Ionian Islands , and to give them to Greece .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,51.264

It would be a boon to them , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,51.265

and it was hoped would ensure their not attacking Turkey .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,51.266

How I did miss beloved Albert , his advice , his opinion !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,51.267

These are such important events , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,51.268

and he is not here any more to share the responsibility with me .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,51.269

But dear Albert would certainly have agreed and approved .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,51.270

The Ionian Islands are not a colony , very disaffected ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,51.271

and would be no strength to us in case of war .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,51.272

Told Lord Russell that I consented , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,51.273

but at the same time pointed out that I did not think either he , or
Lord <P_1,52> Palmerston , had been very straightforward in their
conduct towards the Greeks . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.274

<font> 10th {COM:font_change_excludes_numerals} Dec. <$$font> -
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.275

Saw Mr. Gladstone . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.276

Spoke of Greece , regretting the conduct of some of the Government , and
the lack of straightforwardness at the beginning , which had caused such
excitement ; of the compliment paid to the English nation in asking for
one of my sons ; of Bertie's Treaty of Marriage , and of the Dowry being
small <paren> only 30,000 +L {TEXT:+L30,000} a year <$$paren> and not
sufficient for supporting eventual children .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.277

This , he said , was clear , and he would take care it was understood .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.278

In private life , I said , the Dowry never was meant but for the widow ,
the children always having something set apart for them .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.279

I observed that , had Albert survived me , he never could have supported
the children without an additional sum ! VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.280

Mr. Gladstone added , that it was quite certain that even Albert for
<font> himself <$$font> could not have been able to go on , without an
addition to his income , independently of what had been given for the
children . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.281

This would have been quite understood . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.282

Was glad to hear this , though the occasion for it is , alas ! past .

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.284

Oh ! this dreadful , dreadful day ! VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.285

At 10 we went into the dear room <paren> all the children but Baby there
<$$paren> VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.286

and Dr. Stanley most kindly held a little service for us , reading
Prayers and some portions of the 14th and 16th Chapters of St. John ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.287

and spoke a few and most comforting and beautiful words .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.288

The room was full of flowers , and the sun shining in so brightly ,
emblems of his happiness and glory , which comforted me .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.289

I said it seemed like a birthday , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.290

and Dr. Stanley answered , " It <font> is <$$font> a birthday in a new
world . " VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.291

Oh ! to think of my beginning another year alone !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.292

Went with Alice and Louis to Frogmore , and into the Mausoleum ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.293

then drove a little afterwards . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.294

Lunched alone with Baby . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.295

Out with Augusta Bruce {TEXT:B} . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.296

When I came home the good kind Dean came to see me ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,52.297

and <P_1,53> was very sad . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,53.298

The last Sunday they had had appropriate music at St. George's .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,53.299

Alice dined with me , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,53.300

and then at 10 we had Prayers in the King's Bedroom , all the children ,
myself , and the Duchess of Atholl , Countess Blucher , Augusta B. ,
Mrs. Bruce , Lady Caroline Barrington , and some of the servants being
there . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,53.301

Dr. Stanley performed the short , but most impressive , touching
service . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,53.302

It was full of comfort , though I was a good deal upset .

- Woke very often during the night , thinking of the sacred work to be
carried out at 7 o'clock . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.307

At that hour the precious earthly Remains were to be carried with all
love and peace to their final resting-place by our three sons
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.308

<paren> for little Leopold had earnestly begged to go too <$$paren> .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.309

Dear Louis , Sir C. Phipps , Col. Biddulph , General Grey , as well as
Lohlein and Maget <paren> dear Albert's two valets <$$paren> , were
there too . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.310

I can@ @not say more . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.311

I got some sleep during that time , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.312

and later Alice came to tell me all had been peacefully and lovingly
accomplished . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.313

Dull , raining , and mild . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.314

Took half an hour's drive with Alice , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.315

and at quarter to 1 we all drove down as yesterday to Frogmore , taking
Baby with us . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.316

Waited a little while in the house , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.317

and then walked to the Mausoleum , entering it , preceded only by the
Dean . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.318

It seemed so like the day at Frogmore , when Albert was so dear and
loving . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.319

Everyone entered , each carrying a wreath .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.320

The Dean , with a faltering voice , read some most appropriate Prayers .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.321

We were all much overcome when we knelt round the beloved tomb .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.322

When everybody had gone out , we returned again
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.323

and gazed on the great beauty and peace of the beautiful statue .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.324

What a comfort it will be to have that near me !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.325

Lunched as yesterday . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.326

Afterwards saw the dear kind Duchess of Atholl , who brought me a
handsome Bible , which has been given me and subscribed for by " many
Widows . " VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.327

The very poorest have joined , eighty of the Hartley Colliery widows
amongst them . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.328

Drove with Countess Blucher , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.329

and on coming home , saw the good Dean , who has felt all so much .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.330

Alice dined with me , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,54.331

and we saw Dr. Stanley afterwards for a short while .

- Whilst at dinner , the General's letters arrived , which I did not
like <font> at all . <$$font> VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,61.339

Ernest will not hear of giving up the Duchies , or of Affie's being
Regent , first of all contending that the Constitution did not prevent
his being Duke and King simultaneously , which he afterwards admitted
was not quite the case , but said the Constitution could be suspended ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,61.340

and General Grey suggested this being done , for a time only , adding
that Uncle thought , were <font> I <$$font> to refuse this <paren> which
he is sure dearest Albert would not have objected to <$$paren> , the
effect would be as if it were only <font> I <$$font> who had prevented
the success of the plan ! VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,61.341

This is a most cruel and ungenerous position to have pushed me into ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,61.342

and hurts me deeply . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,61.343

Ernest's other questions and observations are all very <P_1,62> good and
reasonable . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,62.344

Sent for Sir C. Phipps and Dr. Becker , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,62.345

and read the letters VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,62.346

and talked over all with them . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,62.347

They quite saw and felt the painful difficulty in which I had been
placed , and that everything should be done to get me out of it .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,62.348

It was thought , therefore , best to consent to a temporary suspension ,
provided the Chambers consented , and the Duchies did not suffer thereby
. VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,62.349

Ernest is remaining at Brussels to await the answer ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,62.350

but unfortunately it could not be given as the messenger arrived nine
hours later than he ought . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,62.351

In the midst of all this came a letter and draft from Lord Russell ,
acting upon the few words I had written to him yesterday , and proposing
Ernest Leiningen at once to the Greeks . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,62.352

I stopped this at once , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,62.353

and Sir C. Phipps wrote in my name to Lord Russell , sending him

The preparations in London and all over the country quite wonderful ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,71.362

and people are very anxious it should be known that it is meant out of
love and affection to us both ! VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,71.363

There were such good articles in <font> The Times <$$font> and <font>
Globe <$$font> expressing this . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,71.364

Lord Clarendon yesterday so truly said that , when <font> I <$$font>
married , I had only reigned two years , and dearest Albert was not
known , and could not be , though everyone had heard the highest praise
of his character and talents . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,71.365

Still , no one knew or dreamt of his becoming such a wonderful <font>
great <$$font> man ! VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,71.366

There was great rejoicing at my marriage ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,71.367

but on this occasion , as on that of my dreadful loss , there are
outbursts of depth of feeling , which are most touching and gratifying ,
testifying to the appreciation of <font> our <$$font> domestic life of

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,71.368

" The people know , " Lord Clarendon said , " that the young Princess

and this gives the country a great sense of security . "

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,71.374

It began to rain soon after two . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,71.375

There was great doubt , indecision , and waiting , reminding me of the

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.376

People assembled in spite of the rain , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.377

and many were in a stand which had been erected outside the gates at the
top of the hill . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.378

From quarter to 6 , when we heard they had left the Great Western
station , waited with all our daughters , Marie Brabant {TEXT:B} , and
little William , in my room , our four sons having gone to Slough to
meet the train . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.379

Ernest Coburg {TEXT:C} , Philip , and Ernest Leiningen {TEXT:L} , with
all the ladies and gentlemen , waited in the Corridor .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.380

I felt very low and nervous . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.381

The bells began to ring , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.382

and at length , in pouring rain and when it was getting dark , the
carriages and escort were seen coming . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.383

All rushed down , excepting myself , Alice , Marie , and the two little
children . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.384

I went down nearly to the bottom of the staircase ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.385

and Bertie appeared , leading dear Alix , looking like a rose .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.386

I embraced her warmly , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.387

and with her parents , Dagmar , the two sons , Thyra and Waldemar , went
upstairs . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.388

Alix wore a grey dress , with a violet jacket , trimmed with fur , and a
white bonnet . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.389

We all went into the White Drawing-room , where we remained a few
minutes , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.390

and then Vicky took them over to their rooms .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.391

I went back to my room , desolate and sad .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.392

It seemed so dreadful that all this must take place , strangers arrive ,
and <font> he , <$$font> my beloved one , not be there !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.393

Vicky and Alice soon came to me VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.394

and tried to cheer me , and kiss away my tears .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.395

While I was waiting , Vicky returned VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.396

and was sitting with me , dressed for dinner , when dear gentle Alix
knocked at the door , peeped in , and came and knelt before me , with
that sweet , loving expression which spoke volumes .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.397

I was much moved VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.398

and kissed her again and again . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.399

She said the crowd in London had been quite fearful , and the enthusiasm
very great , no end of decorations , etc. , but the crush in the City
had been quite alarming . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.400

Bertie came in for a moment whilst Alix was there .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,72.401

There was a family dinner , I dining alone with Katherine Bruce .

Dagmar came in with Louise , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.404

After dinner I went for half an hour to the White Drawing-room , where
the whole party were assembled , which was a great trial for me .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.406

Sat with Princess Christian , whose great deafness is a great misfortune

and this <paren> to me <$$paren> most trying day is past , as a dream ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.413

for all seems like a dream now VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.414

and leaves hardly any impression upon my poor mind and broken heart !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.415

Here I sit lonely and desolate , who so need love and tenderness , while
our two daughters have each their loving husbands , and Bertie has taken
his lovely , pure , sweet Bride to Osborne , such a jewel whom he is
indeed lucky to have obtained . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.416

How I pray God may ever bless them ! VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.417

Oh ! what I suffered in the Chapel , where all that was joy , pride ,
and happiness on January 25th , '58 , was repeated <font> without
<$$font> the principal figure of all , the guardian angel of the family
, being there . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.418

It was indescribable . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.419

At one moment , when I first heard the flourish of trumpets , which
brought back to my mind my whole life of twenty years at <font> his
<$$font> dear side , safe , proud , secure , and happy , I felt as if I
should faint . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.420

Only by a violent effort could I succeed in mastering my emotion !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.421

But now I must return to the beginning of the day .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.422

Directly after breakfast went over to the State Rooms , to embrace
darling Alix , and give her my blessing .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.423

Her mother was much affected . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.424

Then I went back to my room VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.426

and could see from my windows all the crowds of people assembling and
arriving . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,73.427

Cold from nervousness and agitation , I dressed , <P_1,74> wearing my
weeds , but a silk gown with crape , a long veil to my cap , and , for
the first time since December '61 , the ribbon , star , and badge of the
Order of the Garter , the latter being one my beloved one had worn ,
also the Victoria and Albert Order , on which I have had dearest
Albert's head put above mine , and a brooch containing a miniature of
him set round with diamonds , which I have worn ever since '40 .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.428

Drove with the Duchess of Sutherland and Jane Churchill , Katherine
Bruce and Lord Methuen following in another carriage .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.429

We started from the usual door , going on to the North Terrace , where
we got out and went through a covered way down the small stairs , quite
quietly , up into the Deanery . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.430

A Guard of Honour was mounted in the Quadrangle .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.431

Before I had left I had seen Lenchen in her pretty dress and train ,
lilac and white , and Louise and sweet baby , the same colours .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.432

Louise wore the pearls belonging to dearest Albert's mother , which he
had always intended to give her . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.433

To see them go alone was dreadful . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.434

We waited a short while in the Deanery , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.435

and then went along a covered way prepared over the leads , which
brought us into the Royal Closet . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.436

The divisions had been removed , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.437

and , when I stepped up to the window , the Chapel full of smartly
dressed people , the Knights of the Garter in their robes , the waving
banners , the beautiful window , altar , and reredos to my beloved one's
memory , with the bells ringing outside , quite had the effect of a
scene in a play . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.438

Sat down feeling strange and bewildered .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,74.439

When the procession entered to the playing of the March in <font>
Athalie , <$$font> and after Aunt Cambridge , Mary , and our <P_1,75>
five fatherless children <paren> the three girls and two little boys
<$$paren> came into view , the latter without either parent <paren> at
Vicky's wedding they walked before , behind , and near me <$$paren> , I
felt terribly overcome . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.440

I could not take my eyes off precious little baby , with her golden hair
and large nosegay , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.441

and smiled at her as she made a beautiful curtsey .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.442

Everyone bowed to me . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.443

I quite overlooked Alice coming in , looking extremely well in a violet
dress , covered with her wedding lace , and a violet velvet train , from
the shoulders trimmed with the miniver beloved Mama had worn at Vicky's
wedding , Louis in the Garter robes leading her .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.444

Last came dear Vicky <paren> leading little William <$$paren> , in a
white satin dress trimmed with ermine , etc.
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.445

When she caught sight of me , coming up the Choir , she made a very low
curtsey , with an inexpressible look of love and respect , which had a
most touching effect . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.446

There was a pause , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.447

and then the trumpets sounded again , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.448

and our boy , supported by Ernest Coburg {TEXT:C} and Fritz , all in
Garter robes , entered ; Bertie looking pale and nervous .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.449

He bowed to me , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.450

and during the long wait for his Bride kept constantly looking up at me
, with an anxious , clinging look , which touched me much .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.451

At length she appeared , the band playing Handel's Processional March ,
with her eight Bridesmaids , looking very lovely .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.452

She was trembling and very pale . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.453

Dearest Albert's Chorale was sung , which affected me much ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.454

and then the service proceeded . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.455

When it was over , the young couple looked up at me ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.456

and I gave them an affectionate nod VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.457

and kissed my hand to sweet Alix . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.458

They left together , immediately followed by <font> all <$$font> the
others , Beethoven's Hallelujah Chorus <paren> from <font> The Mount of
Olives <$$font> <$$paren> being played . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.459

I went back to the Castle , getting out at the North Terrace ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.460

and went upstairs for a few minutes . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,75.461

Then hearing the couple were coming , I hastened down the Grand
Staircase <paren> the first time since my misfortune <$$paren> <P_1,76>
where all the Beefeaters were drawn up . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.462

My <font> only <$$font> thought was that of welcoming <font> our
children , <$$font> VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.463

and I stepped out VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.464

and embraced both dear Bertie and Alix most warmly , walking upstairs
next to them and past several of the guests , who had already arrived .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.465

We went into the ante-room , next the Rubens Room ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.466

and here , soon after , Prince Christian , George , Ernest C , and Fritz
joined us . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.467

Went then with Alice over to the Dining-room , and afterwards to the
White Drawing-room , where the young couple and <font> all <$$font> the
others came , for the signing of the Register , which took a very long
time , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.468

A family luncheon of thirty-eight followed , in the Dining-room , the
Joinvilles and daughter , Aumales , and Nemours and Marguerite having
come for that . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.469

Edward Weimar and the Maharajah were also included .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.470

<font> I <$$font> lunched alone with baby .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.471

The two luncheons over , I went back to the White Drawing-room , the
whole assemblage of Royalties being in the Green Drawing-room .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.472

Marguerite looked extremely well , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.473

and wonderful to say , though she is not really pretty , she reminded me
much of her beloved mother . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.474

Shortly afterwards went over with Lenchen , baby , etc. , to the other
side , where all the family were assembled ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.475

and Bertie soon appeared , then darling Alix , looking lovely in a white
silk dress , lace shawl , and white bonnet with orange flowers .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.476

She was much agitated and affected , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.477

and was embraced by all her family , who were in tears ;
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.478

then I once more embraced her and Bertie , with feelings I can@ @not
describe , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.479

and gave them my warmest blessing . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.480

When I saw them go down the crowded staircase , I hurried back to the
Corridor , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.481

and from there saw the open carriage in which the young couple were
seated , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.482

and they stopped for a moment under the window , Bertie standing up ,
and both looking up lovingly at me . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,76.483

<P_1,77>

Then we hastened to my room , where I saw them drive off , through the
enthusiastic crowds . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,77.485

It was so like <font> our <$$font> drivingaway twenty-three years ago
<font> to <$$font> Windsor , amidst the same crowds and shouts of joy !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,77.486

Baby and Thyra were with me . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,77.487

Aunt Cambridge and Mary came in to wish me good-bye ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,77.488

and then I drove with Lenchen down to the Mausoleum ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,77.489

and prayed by that beloved resting-place , feeling soothed and calmed .

- After dinner the Queen read me a letter , or , rather more ,
Memorandum , which the poor King had written and given her with
instructions as to what language she should hold and what she should say
about his Government . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,94.495

It goes to show how sadly he deceives himself , his natural honesty and
conscientiousness making it impossible for him to understand how
dangerous is the course he is pursuing . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,94.496

This distresses and disheartens the poor Queen terribly ,

<P_1,95> the King , whom she seeks to excuse and pities .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,95.498

- At 1 , I went into the Council Room with all the children , the ladies
, and Sir C. Phipps and Sir T. Biddulph , the Duke of <P_1,101>
Newcastle being already in the room . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.506

There , standing at the end , were drawn up the 13 Chiefs and the 3
women , two of them wives of two of the Chiefs .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.507

They were half in native , half in European dress .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.508

The women wore silk petticoats with their strange cloaks of matting ,
and feathers in their hair . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.509

The men also had cloaks , some skins thrown over them , carrying spears
and hatchets , and feathers stuck in their hair .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.510

The greater number of the men were much tattooed , and the women , on
their mouths . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.511

All had fine eyes and beautiful glossy black hair , but not good
features , except three of the men who were tall and good-looking .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.512

They all kissed my hand VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.513

and behaved extremely well . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.514

Several of the men undid their mantles , spreading them at my feet ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.515

and some did the same with their arms , as a symbol of allegiance .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.516

I , through the interpreter , expressed my interest in their welfare ,
sorrow at the war having broken out , and my satisfaction at seeing them
. VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.517

I promised they should be governed , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.518

and thanked them for their beautiful lament .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.519

When they were asked if they had anything to say , one stepped forward
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.520

and expressed the greatest loyalty , declaring they had nothing to do
with the war . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.521

They deeply regretted they had not come sooner , when they would have
seen dearest Albert . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.522

To have seen me had been their greatest joy .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.523

I bowed VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.524

and went upstairs , Sir T. Biddulph following me , saying there were
four different tribes , who each were anxious to speak ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.525

so I went down again VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.526

and three more spoke , and at great length , besides the oldest man of
all , who is sixty , and had fought in several wars .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.527

One said , on seeing me , that he felt inclined to weep ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.528

and spoke of dearest Albert's great virtues , really very touchingly .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.529

Another spoke of their lands being taken away
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.530

and hoped I would promise that this should not be done , which I said I
would . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.531

They are very intelligent . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,101.532

I felt how much my beloved one would approve of my seeing them and

- After luncheon saw Mr. Gladstone , who told me what had passed at the
Cabinet . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,220.551

Lord Russell had read my letter , upon which the Cabinet all at once
said they had never authorised him to inform me that they had decided on
offering arbitration , which if not accepted by Denmark , and refused by
Germany , would entail England's giving material aid to Denmark .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,220.552

It was very serious and disagreeable for me to receive on repeated
occasions such unauthorised decisions from Lord Russell , and ones of
such magnitude . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,220.553

The Cabinet all felt that the moment had not yet come to consider
whether material aid should be given , and certainly not until an answer
had been received from Denmark , saying whether arbitration would be
accepted if proposed . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,220.554

This answer could not be received before some days .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,220.555

During the Cabinet a letter had arrived from Count Bernstorff saying the
Prussians had fresh proposals to make , respecting the boundary , and
Lord Russell was to meet him as well as the other Plenipotentiaries
to-day . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,220.556

" It seems , " Mr. Gladstone said , " to have been the practice never
to meet the German Plenipotentiaries alone , and never to propose
anything but what the <P_1,221> Danes would let us say , " which he and
I both agreed in thinking very odd , and a very bad plan .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.557

Lord Palmerston , who had all along been for partial assistance , seemed
to be fully alive now to the impossibility of doing this single-handed .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.558

The French Plenipotentiaries had received instructions to propose , as a
last resort , should everything else fail , to decide by vote of the
populations what their feelings were as to the boundary .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.559

This the Prussians , as well as the Confederation , approved ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.560

but Austria and Russia disliked . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.561

The Cabinet had been very satisfactory , inasmuch as everybody was in no
way pledged to any kind of action ; VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.562

some indeed there were who thought that under no circumstances material
aid should be given ; VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.563

and indeed Mr. Gladstone said he was much inclined to that himself ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.564

for the responsibility of this country alone going to war would be too
serious and too heavy , unpledged as we are by any promise .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.565

The country had no wish whatever to go to war ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.566

and their excitement arose entirely from misapprehension of the question
. VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.567

Lord Russell seemed to think this country would be humiliated if we
suffered more to be done . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,221.568

There is no doubt we had given the impression of taking too active a
part and encouraging Denmark , which we must never do again .

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,223.574

and found him very sensible , wonderfully clear-headed , and fully alive
to the extreme dangers of the situation .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,223.575

Showed him a telegram from Copenhagen , which made it clear that the
Danes were not inclined , at any rate , to accept arbitration in its
complete form , which of course would render it useless .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,223.576

He did not apprehend the great danger of the whole of Germany being
united as one man against us , though he thought matters most serious .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,223.577

The greatest danger he saw from France joining us was dragging us into a
war , in which she would claim the Rhine , and possibly revolutionise
the whole of Italy . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,223.578

He also entirely agreed with me that it was very doubtful whether we
could do anything , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,223.579

VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,233.586

He was full of mischievous stories . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,233.587

After dinner he talked long and much of the state of affairs .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,233.588

His great fear was the recklessness of Bismarck leading the Prussians to
do something which would again rouse the excitement of the people here .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,233.589

Lord Palmerston had entirely spoilt the end of his speech by the
allusion to Copenhagen , " for when one has untied one's hands , one
does not tie them again . " VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,233.590

But we had had a very great escape , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,233.591

for , if the Danes had accepted , after what Lord Russell had said , we
<P_1,234> should have been in a very awkward position , the danger of
which could not be overrated . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.592

The French had been only waiting to see us well engaged
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.593

and then would have most likely dragged us into a regular European war ,
going themselves to the Rhine . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.594

I said I quite shuddered at what might have happened .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.595

He still much fears that there may be a revolution in Denmark , and that
the poor King may be sent away , which would make a very bad impression
here . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.596

Unfortunately he had shown no great moral courage or energy .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.597

Spoke of the remarkably peaceful feeling in the country , which seemed
at such variance with the intense abuse in the Press here , which we
both agreed had been most mischievous and undignified .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.598

Lord Clarendon had stopped one proposal at the Cabinet , which had been
to the effect to demand of Austria and Prussia to refrain from sending
their Fleets to the Baltic . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.599

We should have certainly exposed ourselves to a very indignant answer ,
which would only have lowered our prestige still more .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.600

Spoke of the deplorable tone of bullying , which we agreed did us great
harm everywhere and lowered the dignity of the country to such an extent
. VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.601

This , Lord Clarendon said , " was certainly essentially Lord
Palmerston's introducing , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.602

he was the father of that , " VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.603

and we both agreed in hoping this tone would die with him .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.604

There had been " an amount of dirty work going on " on the part of the
Opposition , whilst the Conference had been sitting , which Lord
Clarendon said I could have no conception of , but which had entirely
failed , though every means had been employed to act on the Danish
Plenipotentiaries . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,234.605

Told Gen. Grey what to write in answer , how I felt unworthy of
<P_1,267> this high opinion of me , but that it was worth struggling on
in this wretched life , if I could be of use , could preserve peace and
pour balm into wounded hearts ! That these many sad and striking events
had convinced me more and more of the utter nothingness of this world ,
of the terrible uncertainty of all earthly happiness , and of the utter
vanity of all earthly greatness . That virtue , honesty , fearlessness
, truth , unselfishness , and love were the only things truly great and
eternal , whether in high or low . That we were alike before God , and
that , while difference of position and of rank was necessary and must
be supported , one could not be sufficiently loving , kind , and
considerate to those beneath one . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,267.627

I felt this strongly , and that sorrow levelled all distinctions .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,267.628

had truly loved her husband and felt for me , as I would a Queen or any

I would as soon grasp the hand of the humblest peasant who felt for or
with me , as that of the highest of Princes !

Gen. Grey seemed pleased with what I said ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,267.631

Such a feeling of humility comes over me , such a wish to forgive any

Windsor Castle , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.821

<font> 30th {COM:font_change_excludes_numerals} Nov. <$$font> 1866 .

- A bright morning , though very cold . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.823

Shortly before 10 started by train for Wolverhampton , with Lenchen ,
Louise , Christian , etc. ... VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.824

With a sinking heart and trembling knees got out of the train , amidst
great cheering , bands playing , troops presenting arms , etc.
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.825

Was received by Lord Lichfield , Lord Lieutenant of the County <paren>
who presented the Mayor <$$paren> , and Lady Lichfield , looking so
young and handsome , who was standing with Lady Waterpark .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.826

When we were told all was ready entered our carriages , I driving with
my daughters and Christian , with an escort of the 8th Hussars .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.827

The postilions wore the Ascot livery . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.828

Lord A. Paget and General Grey rode just behind the carriage .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.829

All along the three or four miles we drove , the town was beautifully
decorated , with flags , wreaths of dowers , and endless kind
inscriptions . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.830

There were also many arches . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.831

It seemed so strange being amongst so many , yet feeling . So <font>
alone , <$$font> without my beloved husband !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.832

Everything so like former great functions , and yet so unlike !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.833

I felt much moved , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.834

and nearly broke down when I saw the dear name and the following
inscriptions " Honour to the memory of Albert the Good , " " the good
Prince , " " His works follow him , " and so many quotations from
Tennyson . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.835

There were barriers all along , so that there was no overcrowding ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.836

and many Volunteers with bands were stationed at different points .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.837

The arrangements on the spot where the statue stood were extremely good
and the decorations very pretty . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.838

There were high galleries all round , and a covered dais for me ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.839

but the cold wind made it fearfully draughty .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.840

The Prayers and Address were both long , and trying to many .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.841

I made several very deep curtsies when I got out of the carriage and
stepped forward . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.842

The enthusiasm was very great . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,379.843

<P_1,380>

The Mayor was completely taken by surprise when I knighted him ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.845

and seemed quite bewildered , and hardly to understand it when Lord
Derby told him . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.846

There was some slight delay in the uncovering of the statue ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.847

but it fell well and slowly , amidst shouts and the playing of the dear
old Coburg March by the band . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.848

How I could bear up , I hardly know , VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.849

but I remained firm throughout . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.850

At the conclusion of the ceremony I walked round the statue followed by
the children . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.851

I had seen it before at Thornycroft's studio ,
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.852

and it is upon the whole good . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.853

I spoke to the Bishop of Lichfield , Lord and Lady Lichfield , Lady
Waterpark , the Mayoress , who gave me a bouquet , the General , Mr. C.
Villiers , the member , etc. VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.854

We drove back through quite another , and the poorest , part of the town
, which took half an hour . VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.855

There was not a house that had not got its little decoration ;
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.856

and though we passed through some of the most wretched-looking slums
where the people were all in tatters , and many very Irish-looking ,
they were most loyal and demonstrative .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.857

There was not one unkind look or dissatisfied expression ; everyone ,
without exception , being kind and friendly .
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.858

Great as the enthusiasm used always to be wherever dearest Albert and I
appeared , there was something peculiar and touching in the joy and even
emotion with which the people greeted their poor widowed Queen !
VICTORIA-186X-DIARY-2,1,380.859

Reached Windsor safely at a little before 7 , less tired than I should
have expected , and very thankful all had gone off so well , and
gratified at the love shown me by my people .
