STURT-1890-2,1,96.3

When I think what I might have become in other environments - degraded ,
filthy <paren> but I should have died soon <$$paren> , I see that what I
am now , my interests and pursuits - is all something very superficial .
STURT-1890-2,1,96.4

In me , the seeds of crime and beastliness : STURT-1890-2,1,96.5

- what though other faculties were cultivated and these dormant ?
STURT-1890-2,1,96.6

Underneath all , lies Me , the soil with living juices , in which all
these characteristics have their roots . STURT-1890-2,1,96.7

Is it the sense of this that sometimes leaves me so dissatisfied ?
STURT-1890-2,1,96.8

What is that , which I should have been , under <font> any <$$font>
environment ? STURT-1890-2,1,96.9

Could I find and cultivate <font> it <$$font> , there would be fulness
of life . STURT-1890-2,1,96.10

I have@ @n't the faintest idea . STURT-1890-2,1,96.11

Meanwhile , as a makeshift , I reason . That I have eyes , ears , skin
and the rest , all capable of receiving impressions for me : and these I
should have had anyhow . STURT-1890-2,1,96.12

To make the utmost use of these . STURT-1890-2,1,96.13

Yet I suspect that the impressions received would change with
environment . STURT-1890-2,1,96.14

Afternoon . STURT-1890-2,1,96.15

This morning with Frank round Sheephatch . STURT-1890-2,1,96.16

Light covering of snow on ground {COM:editorial_material_omitted}
STURT-1890-2,1,96.17

Yesterday afternoon I went to see Cook who has been knocked up for about
10 days . STURT-1890-2,1,96.18

Cough no longer troublesome ; STURT-1890-2,1,96.19

but extreme weakness and no taste for food . STURT-1890-2,1,96.20

<paren> He <$$paren> ' Had@ @n't seen any of them ' .
STURT-1890-2,1,96.21

I said how Harry had told me Cook was gone to bed when he called .
STURT-1890-2,1,96.22

They stared : STURT-1890-2,1,96.23

did@ @n't think he had called . STURT-1890-2,1,96.24

Seems to have been a gratuitous lie of Harry's . STURT-1890-2,1,96.25

I always - no , not always - feel something false about Harry .
STURT-1890-2,1,96.26

Like him much ; STURT-1890-2,1,96.27

a capital workman - STURT-1890-2,1,96.28

with us over 25 years , I think : STURT-1890-2,1,96.29

- and yet <P_1,97> somehow not always quite to be trusted in details .
STURT-1890-2,1,97.30

Has probably got a taint of the commercial spirit .
STURT-1890-2,1,97.31

Evening . STURT-1890-2,1,97.32

8.30 . STURT-1890-2,1,97.33

Sky clear again now , STURT-1890-2,1,97.34

and stars faintly shining . STURT-1890-2,1,97.35

As I expected , the foggy clouds having cleared off .
STURT-1890-2,1,97.36

I believe I could still draw . STURT-1890-2,1,97.37

Am surprised at the drawing in an old pocket book 8 years ago .
STURT-1890-2,1,97.38

Looking for a remembered drawing amongst Jim's letters <paren> could@
@n't find it <$$paren> I read scraps of these , written in the old '
Newbury Times ' . STURT-1890-2,1,97.39

Almost photographic of that period ... STURT-1890-2,1,97.40

Was minded to write about it , then and now : STURT-1890-2,1,97.41

yet feel a disinclination somehow . STURT-1890-2,1,97.42

A pleasant idle evening , back in the days of romance and boundless hope
, and striving ... STURT-1890-2,1,97.43

I was thinking the other night again of that comet :
STURT-1890-2,1,97.44

had fancied the catastrophe over , me alone with a few friends by some
chance surviving , the remainder of mankind gone : STURT-1890-2,1,97.45

it was strange how empty dull and purposeless the then life presented
itself to me , - with no possible interest any more .
STURT-1890-2,1,97.46

Unwittingly , never so secluded , misanthropic , it would seem , we live
with and for one another , - for the race , mainly .
STURT-1890-2,1,97.47

Reading Whitman , between whiles , as I stir the fire and open passages
for the air underneath , I see in this action a type and example of the
way to make life burn clear and freely . STURT-1890-2,1,97.48

<font> 1 December <$$font> <paren> Monday 11.30 a._m. <$$paren>
STURT-1890-2,1,97.49

Went in just now to the ' Hanging Committee ' of this School of Art
Exhibition . STURT-1890-2,1,97.50

Had sent over some photographs of Langrish's . STURT-1890-2,1,97.51

Makes me grin to think of it . STURT-1890-2,1,97.52

There was Allen ; Dick Mason - important as ever ; Old Austwick , chuff
enough , and 2 or 3 more . STURT-1890-2,1,97.53

This was a back view , - the underside - of ' Art ' .
STURT-1890-2,1,97.54

An important lot of ignoramuses or incompetents . STURT-1890-2,1,97.55

It seemed to me that they would never get anything hung .
STURT-1890-2,1,97.56

Perhaps they will ; STURT-1890-2,1,97.57

' t will be interesting to see . STURT-1890-2,1,97.58

Thankful I@ @'ve no little finger even , in that pie .
STURT-1890-2,1,97.59

And yet so <P_1,98> funny : STURT-1890-2,1,98.60

should like to go and watch 'em . STURT-1890-2,1,98.61

Coming back here , after that little glimpse of ' superior ' humbug ,
't@ @was pleasant to see my men . STURT-1890-2,1,98.62

The old Crimean out on the snowy grass , washing a cart , with ice-cold
water and in the cheerfullest spirits as usual , STURT-1890-2,1,98.63

- nothing discomposes <font> him <$$font> , STURT-1890-2,1,98.64

and he seems always alert . STURT-1890-2,1,98.65

And then Will Hammond at his forge , STURT-1890-2,1,98.66

and , as he looked round when I took the bellows handle , the faint
smell of an onion he had had with his bread and cheese .
STURT-1890-2,1,98.67

I asked him how his wife was . STURT-1890-2,1,98.68

<paren> Diseased knee-bone <$$paren> . STURT-1890-2,1,98.69

She could move her leg anywhere , with her hands . STURT-1890-2,1,98.70

He showed me how , chucking his own leg about , hands under his thigh
STURT-1890-2,1,98.71

Rare fellow for pantomime is Will <$$paren> . STURT-1890-2,1,98.72

But does@ @n't think she@ @'ll ever be able to walk again ...
STURT-1890-2,1,98.73

Cook no better : STURT-1890-2,1,98.74

Tarbett too not here today . STURT-1890-2,1,98.75

I too have been almost as stagnant as the day . STURT-1890-2,1,98.76

<paren> Yet when I think of this morning's newspaper , it seems almost
an intrusion <$$paren> . STURT-1890-2,1,98.77

Unelastic , so that the little nuisances of business leave their dint in
me , longer than usual . STURT-1890-2,1,98.78

Have made but little advance upon yesterday : STURT-1890-2,1,98.79

and feel as if the day were mostly lost . STURT-1890-2,1,98.80

Have we too our winter-seasons , - a necessary tonic between autumn and
spring ? STURT-1890-2,1,98.81

I saw how in every untrodden spot , - round old stumps , and between
road and wall , the grass , ever ready , had found life good to live .
STURT-1890-2,1,98.82

Our minds are too much trodden , - a paved highway for affairs :
STURT-1890-2,1,98.83

but do I make the most of every protected or untouched interval ?
STURT-1890-2,1,98.84

I have hardly got this day as a part of me , STURT-1890-2,1,98.85

but have shivered in its shadow . STURT-1890-2,1,98.86

But such weather is unattractive , because we are too rusty and dull .
STURT-1890-2,1,98.87

A day like this may yield music ; STURT-1890-2,1,98.88

but the soul must be very fine-strung to respond to its faint harmonies
. STURT-1890-2,1,98.89

Who knows but to such an one it might offer the best of all ?
STURT-1890-2,1,98.90

Today I have noticed , or perhaps fancied , an inclination occurring at
times through all these years , on the part of my men to take advantage
of me : in small matters , as to beginning and leaving off , taking a
quarter of a day , and so on . STURT-1890-2,1,98.91

It rather spoils my temper . STURT-1890-2,1,98.92

But there are some encouragements . STURT-1890-2,1,98.93

Bone brought today , quite on his own initiative , a drawing for me to
see <paren> copied from Harrison's Weir <$$paren> .
STURT-1890-2,1,98.94

4 p._m. STURT-1890-2,1,98.95

If I could carry on business without customers , I think I should@ @n't
<font> hate <$$font> it <paren> though might get deadly sick of it
<$$paren> . STURT-1890-2,1,98.96

<P_1,99>

A low meanminded lot , always looking to take advantage of you .
STURT-1890-2,1,99.98

The worst are the ' successful ' men - village people , who from being
labourers themselves , or artisans , have become employers .
STURT-1890-2,1,99.99

One or two especially I think of <paren> have just had one here ,
facetiously sordid this afternoon <$$paren> , who seem capable of every
conceivable meanness . STURT-1890-2,1,99.100

This is their business , and their pleasure . STURT-1890-2,1,99.101

One would like to be able to speak plainly to them and be rid of them .
STURT-1890-2,1,99.102

8.30 p._m. STURT-1890-2,1,99.103

'T@ @is long since I have lived so barren and indifferent as today .
STURT-1890-2,1,99.104

I suppose I owe it partly to lying abed until breakfast time , and
losing the morning freshness . STURT-1890-2,1,99.105

Business has been insistent , with trifling anxieties ; so that I was
fool enough to read about Parnell's split with Gladstone , during the
earlier intervals , and filled up the later ones with bookkeeping .
STURT-1890-2,1,99.106

Have been eating flesh , too . STURT-1890-2,1,99.107

Can hardly remember the weather today . STURT-1890-2,1,99.108

How has it been , out o' doors ? STURT-1890-2,1,99.109

The hours have gone by with their changes , STURT-1890-2,1,99.110

and I have missed them . STURT-1890-2,1,99.111

I think there was sunshine in the earlier part of the day :
STURT-1890-2,1,99.112

but when I got out , towards dark , a colourless fog , snow almost gone
, and ground soft - oozy underfoot , as though the earth's skin slipped
as you trod . STURT-1890-2,1,99.113

A very dark night : STURT-1890-2,1,99.114

no wind : STURT-1890-2,1,99.115

church-bells dinning , STURT-1890-2,1,99.116

and myself chilly and afraid of the misty evening .
STURT-1890-2,1,99.117

Have had little time and less energy to cultivate the day .
STURT-1890-2,1,99.118

I feel that I have subtracted one day from vitality , and added it to my
years . STURT-1890-2,1,99.119

Life is a pyramid whose base is vitality and whose apex should be
cloudless . STURT-1890-2,1,99.120

<font> 2 December <$$font> <paren> Tuesday 9.30 p._m. <$$paren> ...
STURT-1890-2,1,99.121

I have been to the Exhibition of the School of Art :
STURT-1890-2,1,99.122

mostly dead and damned . STURT-1890-2,1,99.123

It has confirmed my previous conviction of the incompatibility of any
true art with these times of snobs . STURT-1890-2,1,99.124

' Ars longa ' : STURT-1890-2,1,99.125

but we seem to have outlived it at last . STURT-1890-2,1,99.126

Exceedingly funny too . STURT-1890-2,1,99.127

My ideal when I came away was of some little pub , with beer <paren> Jim
there <$$paren> and the gossip of country fellows .
STURT-1890-2,1,99.128

Allen came in as I came out : STURT-1890-2,1,99.129

<P_1,100>

looked pleased : STURT-1890-2,1,100.131

must have been working like a nigger-slave to galvanize these dead
things into life . STURT-1890-2,1,100.132

Absalom Harris too , who had some nice pottery on show : he beaming as
usual : talking of Bellamy's ' Looking Backward ' , which he is it seems
recommending right and left . STURT-1890-2,1,100.133

By the way , the state of the ' arts ' in that book is about the
apotheosis that such shows as this gravitate towards .
STURT-1890-2,1,100.134

Bourgeois-philanthropic . STURT-1890-2,1,100.135

By the nature of things they will never get <font> there <$$font> :
STURT-1890-2,1,100.136

and this is comforting . STURT-1890-2,1,100.137

A beautiful bit of inlaying work , by Loman at Tompsett and Kingham's .
STURT-1890-2,1,100.138

The man , I heard , had spent six months at it ! STURT-1890-2,1,100.139

Think of that : STURT-1890-2,1,100.140

Six months , say a hundredth part of his whole life : or an eightieth
part of what he still has to expect : STURT-1890-2,1,100.141

- and for that , has got , - a table top ! STURT-1890-2,1,100.142

Shall we say , that this is the value he puts on himself : - say ,
eighty or a_hundred tables is the worth to him of his life ?
STURT-1890-2,1,100.143

<paren> But no ; STURT-1890-2,1,100.144

he flutes or fifes , or some such thing ; besides doing his day's work :
which however , being spent only in <font> getting <$$font> his living ,
do@ @n't count <$$paren> . STURT-1890-2,1,100.145

What does he do for it ? STURT-1890-2,1,100.146

'T@ @is@ @n't art : but ingenuity merely . STURT-1890-2,1,100.147

The more I think of art <paren> in its modern sense , i.e. divorced
from necessary labour <$$paren> the more puzzled I get to know what it
is and why people do it , or buy it . STURT-1890-2,1,100.148

This too is my own narrowness of mind . STURT-1890-2,1,100.149

Had I learnt to draw , I might have known . STURT-1890-2,1,100.150

Meanwhile I have no room for regret . STURT-1890-2,1,100.151

<font> 3 December <$$font> <paren> Wednesday <$$paren> 11.0 a._m.
STURT-1890-2,1,100.152

Thought just now , Would that 't@ @were summer weather , and I could go
to Thursley , to loll about . STURT-1890-2,1,100.153

But after all , that is@ @n't what I want : no <font> going <$$font>
anywhere , or <font> doing <$$font> anything ; but to <font> be <$$font>
... STURT-1890-2,1,100.154

8.30 p._m. STURT-1890-2,1,100.155

'T@ @is three weeks ago that I returned from Richmond .
STURT-1890-2,1,100.156

Feel a little disappointed that by this time there is no letter .
STURT-1890-2,1,100.157

To me the time has been so full <paren> of what ? <$$paren> that it
seems much more like three months . STURT-1890-2,1,100.158

Have been up 14 hours , and at the beck and call of my business the
whole time <paren> though not the whole time , by much , actually
engaged in business <$$paren> . STURT-1890-2,1,100.159

Now I am dull and inclined for sleep . STURT-1890-2,1,100.160

How to spend the next hour and half ? STURT-1890-2,1,100.161

Some fellows just gone by the window , marching quick to the <P_1,101>
sound of a whistle pipe and bones . STURT-1890-2,1,101.162

Tho' I do@ @n't know its name , the tune is familiar to me from hearing
it frequently in this way . STURT-1890-2,1,101.163

Some recent opera-air . STURT-1890-2,1,101.164

This sort of music affects me about as much as any other <paren> except
at exceptional times <$$paren> . STURT-1890-2,1,101.165

I like it ; STURT-1890-2,1,101.166

but could dispense with it . STURT-1890-2,1,101.167

I have never learnt to listen . STURT-1890-2,1,101.168

The common effect on me of good music is to set me thinking rapidly ,
and very disconnectedly , so that I do@ @n't heed the music .
STURT-1890-2,1,101.169

The slight pleasure I have in it must be mainly inherited , - a common
possession of the average Englishman of today : probably quite different
from the music affected by savage races . STURT-1890-2,1,101.170

Helmholtz and Ellis demonstrate that what pleases us in a musical chord
is a coincidence of separate vibrations . STURT-1890-2,1,101.171

<paren> Or so I have understood Jim and his father . <$$paren>
STURT-1890-2,1,101.172

Very good : STURT-1890-2,1,101.173

but they have@ @n't demonstrated why we like that , instead of the
opposite to that STURT-1890-2,1,101.174

<paren> or have they done so ? STURT-1890-2,1,101.175

I have@ @n't read them : - not a page : STURT-1890-2,1,101.176

STURT-1890-2,1,101.178

Singularly sleepy - or drowsy , this morning . STURT-1890-2,1,101.179

Walked down here , at least , part of the way , shrunk into my coat and
gloves , as though in bed . STURT-1890-2,1,101.180

Pulled myself together , rousing ; STURT-1890-2,1,101.181

but can@ @not quite shake the feeling off . STURT-1890-2,1,101.182

What if 't@ @were a dream still ? STURT-1890-2,1,101.183

Just after getting into bed last night , I found myself thinking of
business ; STURT-1890-2,1,101.184

and the glass in the picture over the fire-place seemed one of my office
windows . STURT-1890-2,1,101.185

1$$4 to 1 . STURT-1890-2,1,101.186

Strongish E. wind . STURT-1890-2,1,101.187

Wet , rainy mist . STURT-1890-2,1,101.188

I keep shambling in and out STURT-1890-2,1,101.189

and shall probably be sneezing presently . STURT-1890-2,1,101.190

Business a thorough nuisance today . STURT-1890-2,1,101.191

Cook , Tarbett and the boy away . STURT-1890-2,1,101.192

Customers asking about work that is not yet begun .
STURT-1890-2,1,101.193

Could employ twice as many men as I have here . STURT-1890-2,1,101.194

Frequent interruptions of details . STURT-1890-2,1,101.195

All requires mainly a clear head and a ready will .
STURT-1890-2,1,101.196

It seems as if nothing specific to think of : STURT-1890-2,1,101.197

yet I dare hardly begin to think of anything outside the business .
STURT-1890-2,1,101.198

To add to other nuisances , Harry has asked me whether I ca@ @n't find
room for his boy , who he fears will go for a soldier .
STURT-1890-2,1,101.199

Should <P_1,102> like to oblige Harry : STURT-1890-2,1,102.200

but am by no means sure that I want the boy . STURT-1890-2,1,102.201

There is Hunt I have thought of getting rid of : STURT-1890-2,1,102.202

but do@ @n't like turning him out for this chap .
STURT-1890-2,1,102.203

Seems like a ' job ' , - favouritism , etc. STURT-1890-2,1,102.204

And then , Harry himself , and the other men , are a jealous queer lot ;
STURT-1890-2,1,102.205

besides that there@ @'s a constant smouldering quarrel between Harry and
Pharo , which might make the boy's place difficult and lead to
complications ... STURT-1890-2,1,102.206

1$$4 to 5 . STURT-1890-2,1,102.207

Have just been to enquire for Tarbett , and his ' rheumatism ' .
STURT-1890-2,1,102.208

Found him not in ; out in this wet east-wind weather .
STURT-1890-2,1,102.209

The old woman he lodges with <paren> good terribly prosy old soul
<$$paren> has no good word for him . STURT-1890-2,1,102.210

Says he@ @'s relying on my being busy , to make me take him back to work
: STURT-1890-2,1,102.211

but he means <paren> she says <$$paren> to go at Christmas .
STURT-1890-2,1,102.212

Further reports of him : STURT-1890-2,1,102.213

he drinks , STURT-1890-2,1,102.214

comes in late at night , STURT-1890-2,1,102.215

goes to bed without taking off his clothes , STURT-1890-2,1,102.216

has pawned his boots , besides other things , <paren> I did@ @n't gather
what <$$paren> received from London , where he claims to have a son .
STURT-1890-2,1,102.217

Told her that he worked here before breakfast Monday morning : but none

Goes out <paren> to pawnbrokers ? <$$paren> spite of his rheumatism :
STURT-1890-2,1,102.219

came in yesterday telling her he had walked miles :
STURT-1890-2,1,102.220

told her he had been to London Monday to meet his son .
STURT-1890-2,1,102.221

Had some good clothes Saturday , STURT-1890-2,1,102.222

and washed himself <paren> ! <$$paren> ; STURT-1890-2,1,102.223

went to Aldershot , and to judge by his talk reported to me , for
prostitutes . STURT-1890-2,1,102.224

A man of 50 years or more ; claiming to have daughters : - 4 children
... STURT-1890-2,1,102.225

<paren> The same miserable business , with a young man I had here some
time ago , - whom I had taken a strong liking to . <$$paren>
STURT-1890-2,1,102.226

Tarbett works well , - not rapidly : STURT-1890-2,1,102.227

- but I must have someone I can depend on . STURT-1890-2,1,102.228

The old woman very prosy and garrulous : STURT-1890-2,1,102.229

I could@ @n't get away from her . STURT-1890-2,1,102.230

Amongst other unknown wretchedness , this man probably has lost hope :
STURT-1890-2,1,102.231

sees no future worth having . STURT-1890-2,1,102.232

I had been wondering , what the Socialists would do with such a one .
STURT-1890-2,1,102.233

Perhaps the new Hope would solve the problem . STURT-1890-2,1,102.234

Evening . STURT-1890-2,1,102.235

8.15 . STURT-1890-2,1,102.236

Must write a <paren> business <$$paren> letter first though : - to let
nothing so far as I can help spoil tomorrow morning's taste ...
STURT-1890-2,1,102.237

I do@ @n't recollect ever getting more sickened with my business than
today . STURT-1890-2,1,102.238

It has just spoilt me , so far as making <P_1,103> use of this belated
leisure is concerned . STURT-1890-2,1,103.239

Seems as if I had no tastes . STURT-1890-2,1,103.240

The weather outside is very dark and the roads very dirty .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.241

I have little energy left for walking ; not enough to enable me to enjoy
the cold wind ... STURT-1890-2,1,103.242

This sort of slavery comes of being master of workmen .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.243

These leisure times may be called my life . STURT-1890-2,1,103.244

My days are three hours long : counting sleep , ten or eleven hours .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.245

It shortens one's life ! STURT-1890-2,1,103.246

The whole twenty-four were too little if one could live them fully .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.247

How insufficient the common occupations and interests seem : - reading ,
drawing , and the rest . STURT-1890-2,1,103.248

To waste precious minutes learning German ! STURT-1890-2,1,103.249

Suppose that acquired , STURT-1890-2,1,103.250

- What <font> then <$$font> ? STURT-1890-2,1,103.251

I love Thoreau of late more than any other writer :
STURT-1890-2,1,103.252

but while I am reading him , where am <font> I <$$font> ?
STURT-1890-2,1,103.253

It were good too to have read Mill - to have studied Economics .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.254

Yet 't@ @is but <font> one <$$font> , out of the numberless possible
sciences : STURT-1890-2,1,103.255

and why choose that particular one ? STURT-1890-2,1,103.256

It has very much the appearance of a toss-up , this life of ours .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.257

We take so much pains with our life ; STURT-1890-2,1,103.258

make such a business of it . STURT-1890-2,1,103.259

You will find , that it is always postponed . STURT-1890-2,1,103.260

What , for instance , are economics for , but to throw light on the
problem <font> How to Live <$$font> ? STURT-1890-2,1,103.261

And so , one forgets to live , labouring at economics .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.262

Next ? STURT-1890-2,1,103.263

- Well , biology promises useful hints . STURT-1890-2,1,103.264

What then is the latest news about Evolution ? STURT-1890-2,1,103.265

... So on , <font> ad infinitum . <$$font> STURT-1890-2,1,103.266

Yet , we can never hope to know much about it , that way .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.267

Is it not possible to take some higher ground , - to fly <font> above
<$$font> these labyrinthine roadways where the maps hardly tally , -
easily to pass through the upper air , now and then perhaps alighting
where the roadway pleases us ? STURT-1890-2,1,103.268

These arts and sciences for pleasure only : not a duty .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.269

What have they to do with <font> me <$$font> ? STURT-1890-2,1,103.270

One pleasure I owe to being about all day - that of lying back and
resting my back . STURT-1890-2,1,103.271

Actually a <font> positive <$$font> pleasure , worth recording ;
wherefore I have sat up to do so . STURT-1890-2,1,103.272

<font> 5 December <$$font> <paren> Friday <$$paren> .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.273

Have@ @n't seen Tarbett . STURT-1890-2,1,103.274

I left word yesterday that I should like to see him .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.275

Harry says he was in last night : but not while I was here .
STURT-1890-2,1,103.276

<P_1,104>

Catt has been in <paren> 5.0 p._m. now <$$paren> .
STURT-1890-2,1,104.278

Feels vexed that Allen kept away from the Exhibition .
STURT-1890-2,1,104.279

Catt was most assiduous in his attention there . STURT-1890-2,1,104.280

We agreed that Allen did@ @n't know which side his bread was buttered .
STURT-1890-2,1,104.281

Allen it seems declines introductions ; does@ @n't want to see people .
STURT-1890-2,1,104.282

Afterwards met Allen , talking to Hoste STURT-1890-2,1,104.283

<paren> that@ @'s where these fellows lose : STURT-1890-2,1,104.284

why ca@ @n't they stick their backs up against religion ? <$$paren> .
STURT-1890-2,1,104.285

I went with Allen into School of Art . STURT-1890-2,1,104.286

He mentioned that Catt had been blowing him up : STURT-1890-2,1,104.287

but he did@ @n't want any more private teaching .
STURT-1890-2,1,104.288

<paren> The man seems indifferent to money . STURT-1890-2,1,104.289

Would like to spend his time - as the other day , spite of the cold -
out in the hedge , drawing <$$paren> . STURT-1890-2,1,104.290

I regret now that I did@ @n't say to either what I meant ; or rather ,
that I quietly acquiesced with both , meaning nothing ; and so played a
two-faced part . STURT-1890-2,1,104.291

Tried to explain to Allen my impressions of the exhibition ;
STURT-1890-2,1,104.292

but they had worn dull , STURT-1890-2,1,104.293

and I failed ; though he said he knew what I meant .
STURT-1890-2,1,104.294

I should believe him , if I saw any trace of his ever having felt or
thought as I felt . STURT-1890-2,1,104.295

But since I hardly knew myself what I meant this afternoon , 't@ @is@
@n't very likely that he knew . STURT-1890-2,1,104.296

Before the sort of art arrives , that I want to see , the whole make-up
, and all the daily incidents , of society must be completely changed .
STURT-1890-2,1,104.297

It must be done for its own delight ; and for no other consideration
whatever . STURT-1890-2,1,104.298

These people of Farnham , not the working sort only <paren> they as well
, though <$$paren> , but the respectables , are little other than
Savages <font> plus <$$font> the policeman . STURT-1890-2,1,104.299

Their ' religion ' is but a luxuriant development of magic and fetishism
: STURT-1890-2,1,104.300

and in their social life , even a casual observer may see the old
materialized Aryan stock <paren> very good doubtless <$$paren> , with
the same ideals and occupations , - wealth , eating and drinking ,
horses , material prosperity - improved into Civilisation
STURT-1890-2,1,104.301

<paren> think how we passively support a standing army ; anachronism as
it is ! <$$paren> : STURT-1890-2,1,104.302

and perhaps not one in a_hundred_thousand has ever realised , that life
is something different from all this . STURT-1890-2,1,104.303

The value of life ! STURT-1890-2,1,104.304

It is frittered away in affairs , and social duties and elegances .
STURT-1890-2,1,104.305

The art I want must grow up , as a part of Life fully realised :
STURT-1890-2,1,104.306

but that which we get , and try to impart <P_1,105> in Schools of Art ,
is a mere varnish over all this barbarism , - another occupation - thing
to live <font> for <$$font> , not to <font> live <$$font> !
STURT-1890-2,1,105.307

I saw that the strong wind just now was breaking up and blowing away
these three days' clouds . STURT-1890-2,1,105.308

It did@ @n't affect me : STURT-1890-2,1,105.309

I had been talking : STURT-1890-2,1,105.310

and was coming back to this barbarous ' business ' of mine .
STURT-1890-2,1,105.311

One must yield himself up to the weather , - give himself away to it , -
before it will touch him . STURT-1890-2,1,105.312

For the most part , we are savages under that old curse :
STURT-1890-2,1,105.313

the wind will not blow , the sun shine , nor the rain fall , upon us .
STURT-1890-2,1,105.314

The Evolution of <paren> Self <$$paren> Consciousness , - is not this
the urge , that men call , striving for truth , for reality ?
STURT-1890-2,1,105.315

8.30 p._m. STURT-1890-2,1,105.316

Very slight headache . STURT-1890-2,1,105.317

Wind out o' doors strong and cold , from the East .
STURT-1890-2,1,105.318

Have walked rapidly a little way : STURT-1890-2,1,105.319

now my hands are glowing warm . STURT-1890-2,1,105.320

Should have walked further , STURT-1890-2,1,105.321

but my mind was filled ridiculously with the prospect of a row with
Pharo tomorrow morning . STURT-1890-2,1,105.322

Early in the week , in the midst of this pressing work , he took a
quarter-day holiday , STURT-1890-2,1,105.323

and agreed to work an hour later each night , until he had made it up .
STURT-1890-2,1,105.324

I think , but am not quite sure , that he did@ @n't do his hour tonight
: STURT-1890-2,1,105.325

and unless I protest pretty strongly , I may as well give up trying to
control that business . STURT-1890-2,1,105.326

I hate a row ; STURT-1890-2,1,105.327

and to begin the day with it seems particularly disgusting .
STURT-1890-2,1,105.328

<font> 6 December <$$font> <paren> Saturday <$$paren> 9.0 p._m.
STURT-1890-2,1,105.329

The row with Pharo did@ @n't take place . STURT-1890-2,1,105.330

I woke about 4 this morning STURT-1890-2,1,105.331

<paren> slight asthma <$$paren> STURT-1890-2,1,105.332

and thought over the circumstances , STURT-1890-2,1,105.333

- found my reckoning wrong , to my great relief .
STURT-1890-2,1,105.334

Tarbett has@ @n't shown up : STURT-1890-2,1,105.335

shall probably have to send him going . STURT-1890-2,1,105.336

Tonight Bone has been here doing geometry ... STURT-1890-2,1,105.337

It has left me empty-headed . STURT-1890-2,1,105.338

He is the best bricklayer , who can dispense with a plumb-line .
STURT-1890-2,1,105.339

The plumb-line of Society is the Law . STURT-1890-2,1,105.340

To the sober man it is an insult : STURT-1890-2,1,105.341

hang it round the drunkard's neck . STURT-1890-2,1,105.342

<font> 7 December <$$font> <paren> Sunday afternoon <$$paren>
STURT-1890-2,1,105.343

Weather seen from indoors dull and lifeless , STURT-1890-2,1,105.344

but {COM:editorial_material_omitted} I should like this book to hold as
much of out-doors as I can bring home : as some people put leaves
between the pages of <P_1,106> their books . STURT-1890-2,1,106.345

But this for sun and wind , and the days and seasons and colours of the
atmosphere . STURT-1890-2,1,106.346

8.0 p._m. STURT-1890-2,1,106.347

It has been a good day . STURT-1890-2,1,106.348

I sat here upstairs by the fire the whole afternoon ,
STURT-1890-2,1,106.349

and did nothing : STURT-1890-2,1,106.350

but looked for a time , and then again at intervals , across to the
window and out at the quiet sky . STURT-1890-2,1,106.351

It was very still : outside , the clouds gradually disappearing , as the
afternoon drew on ; and smoke from a near chimney indicating the wind
and the freshness of the open air : within , perfect quiet , but for the
rustling fire , and , as I listened more closely , a faint moaning of
wind in the chimney . STURT-1890-2,1,106.352

So I sat , attentive , STURT-1890-2,1,106.353

and read nothing ; until the night had fairly started .
STURT-1890-2,1,106.354

With such preparation , it needed a true book to satisfy me .
STURT-1890-2,1,106.355

I read Thoreau's ' Summer ' with great content ; until I found myself
reading at last for the sake of reading , and put it by .
STURT-1890-2,1,106.356

Such a book should not be used so where a meaner will serve the purpose
equally well . STURT-1890-2,1,106.357

Others I tried , STURT-1890-2,1,106.358

but did@ @n't really want them , STURT-1890-2,1,106.359

and have left the endeavour , merely skimming at tea the surface of an
Emerson Essay . STURT-1890-2,1,106.360

I read less and less , STURT-1890-2,1,106.361

but am less <font> bored <$$font> than when I needed books to stimulate
me . STURT-1890-2,1,106.362

Most books are apt to gravel ... STURT-1890-2,1,106.363

10.0 o'clock . STURT-1890-2,1,106.364

I suppose I have been rather foolish to be so lazy .
STURT-1890-2,1,106.365

No book suits , STURT-1890-2,1,106.366

and I have lolled here , letting the thoughts come or stay away : myself
indifferent . STURT-1890-2,1,106.367

To <font> read <$$font> , though ! STURT-1890-2,1,106.368

Where is the book that deserves so great a compliment ?
STURT-1890-2,1,106.369

... I should have done better to go out : STURT-1890-2,1,106.370

yet the darkness and the cold discouraged me . STURT-1890-2,1,106.371

After all , I have been very comfortable , - even happy , in a mild
negative way . STURT-1890-2,1,106.372

Only , not so vividly happy as this life deserves to be , and may be .
STURT-1890-2,1,106.373

Had it but been a little warmer , - and no streets to go through !
STURT-1890-2,1,106.374

The streets o' Sunday evenings get filled with folly .
STURT-1890-2,1,106.375

Every minute is a great occasion : STURT-1890-2,1,106.376

but 't@ @is@ @n't every minute that we are able to rise to it .
STURT-1890-2,1,106.377

It may be said , The house is always here : - but the man ?
STURT-1890-2,1,106.378

We are generally either in yesterday or tomorrow .
STURT-1890-2,1,106.379

When we are in the present , - when the soul and the minute meet in the
<font> Now <$$font> - the associations are formed which in less vivid
times we look back to . STURT-1890-2,1,106.380

It seems as if then the sun shone indeed , as it has not since .
STURT-1890-2,1,106.381

For then our soul emerged into the sunlight for a while .

My uncle <paren> J. Smith <$$paren> at dinner . STURT-1890-2,1,107.390

Discussion with him of the Labour and wages problems , - 8 hours and the

- he@ @'s sensitive , - of the old school too - STURT-1890-2,1,107.393

and I should be sorry to upset him . STURT-1890-2,1,107.394

I found the whole discussion fairly interesting , while it lasted : but
myself unsusceptible to the afternoon , when I came away .
STURT-1890-2,1,107.395

Go now to loaf in the garden awhile : <paren> the men who usually work
near there being now out of the way . STURT-1890-2,1,107.396

STURT-1890-2,1,107.398

But I am a prisoner on parole , STURT-1890-2,1,107.399

and returned soon to my business , to be here if wanted .
STURT-1890-2,1,107.400

Partly for thought of that , and partly because of the noise <paren>
incessant smoking of trains and schoolboys shouting , on one side : on
the other , shouting football players <$$paren> the afternoon made no

<font> 9 December <$$font> <paren> Tuesday <$$paren>
STURT-1890-2,1,107.402

Ground hard with frost . STURT-1890-2,1,107.403

The stars are hidden : the air thick as with darkness , not with fog .
The park trees dimly visible from the path out here ,
STURT-1890-2,1,107.404

and there is that half-suggested twilight noticed yesterday : which must
I suppose mean day coming . STURT-1890-2,1,107.405

All is very still . STURT-1890-2,1,107.406

In the darkness just now I leaned against a post by the path , listening
to separate the morning's gloom and stillness from the petty noise and
glare of workshops <paren> mine amongst them <$$paren> .
STURT-1890-2,1,107.407

Then , as I was beginning to succeed , and to breathe that quietness , a
noise of footsteps warned me to be moving . STURT-1890-2,1,107.408

It will not do yet , to be taken for a madman . STURT-1890-2,1,107.409

I had already lit my fire here , having for once been out before Will
Hammond . STURT-1890-2,1,107.410

I heard him close behind , stop and feel the string left on the bell for
a sign I was gone , STURT-1890-2,1,107.411

then he came scuffling and snorting on . STURT-1890-2,1,107.412

The streets very dark . STURT-1890-2,1,107.413

Lighting my pipe , the pavement felt strange to my feet ,
STURT-1890-2,1,107.414

and I narrowly <P_1,108> missed a collision with the houses .
STURT-1890-2,1,108.415

How good tobacco is at such a time . STURT-1890-2,1,108.416

Further on , I was near running into a horse and cart stopped in the
street : STURT-1890-2,1,108.417

but fortunately the beast was a white one , STURT-1890-2,1,108.418

and I saw him ghost-like just in time . STURT-1890-2,1,108.419

The look of the streets made me think of Stevenson's story of Villon .
STURT-1890-2,1,108.420

Jim's programmes yesterday morning , and a letter from him last night .
STURT-1890-2,1,108.421

Writing to him , my brain grew excited , STURT-1890-2,1,108.422

and it was past 12 before I got off to sleep . STURT-1890-2,1,108.423

A short night , which will probably make me sleepy today .
STURT-1890-2,1,108.424

The boy Mathews came in this morning , after being away ill about a

Only seven here , STURT-1890-2,1,108.427

The self-possession I have been looking towards lately , that would
influence and exalt every action , is akin to Religious Enthusiasm .
STURT-1890-2,1,110.495

The genuine Christian , who carries everything through with a silent
reference to his ideal in Jesus , attains an elevation of being parallel
to the Cyrenaic's . STURT-1890-2,1,110.496

Is then this philosophy as unproductive and barren as Christianity , -
serviceable to the individual , but powerless for the regeneration of
society , or for improvement of future generations ?
STURT-1890-2,1,110.497

For though there have been many excellent Christians , the race remains
timidly savage ... STURT-1890-2,1,110.498

'T@ @is well , at any rate , to guard against the prestige of such
expressions as ' exalted being ' , ' elevated thought ' and the like .
STURT-1890-2,1,110.499

They refer us always to an outside standard : STURT-1890-2,1,110.500

but to be true to ourselves , we should be as ready for what is not
exalted . STURT-1890-2,1,110.501

To keep the soul open to all impressions , and choose the most truly
attractive , - that is the safest foundation I can find , for low or
high thinking . STURT-1890-2,1,110.502

The highest thought topples from a shaky base . STURT-1890-2,1,110.503

But we must be careful to have a real choice : STURT-1890-2,1,110.504

the city man , who must choose between ' greasy domesticity ' or the
blackguard folly of clubs , is the slave of necessity ,
STURT-1890-2,1,110.505

and mistakes the despair bred of resourcelessness for choice and
inclination . STURT-1890-2,1,110.506

There should be at least as many resources , as senses that can be
appealed to . STURT-1890-2,1,110.507

Yet the most might as well be blind and deaf , for all the enjoyment
their souls get from eyes and ears , which are degraded to the service
of the other organs . STURT-1890-2,1,110.508

Too often they are mere conductors of poison to the mind : open windows
over the cesspits and sinks of unwholesomeness . Not even stink-traps

Ice on upper panes of bedroom window . STURT-1890-2,1,110.513

Moderate E. or S.E . wind . STURT-1890-2,1,110.514

Grass <P_1,111> white with rime . STURT-1890-2,1,111.515

The fog , which cleared considerably about 7 last night , not yet gone ,

To realise myself is now an effort which my mind shrinks from .
STURT-1890-2,1,111.517

Perhaps more vigour is devoted to keeping up the animal heat .
STURT-1890-2,1,111.518

But I confess to no great success in appreciation of this fog ; though
it has not disturbed my equanimity . STURT-1890-2,1,111.519

But there has been an effort and tension this last few days .
STURT-1890-2,1,111.520

The grass just now hinted to me , that away from the town that which I
was looking for would present itself unsought : STURT-1890-2,1,111.521

but I suspect there is something in the mental attitude required .
STURT-1890-2,1,111.522

Past experience proves that . STURT-1890-2,1,111.523

This day has looked drear and dull enough in the town :
STURT-1890-2,1,111.526

no sunlight but a makeshift sort of lightness , as if made on the cheap
by a contractor to the local Board . STURT-1890-2,1,111.527

So I thought this morning , well knowing that 't@ @was the senseless
shivering about without exercise in rooms etc. that was to blame .
STURT-1890-2,1,111.528

I have now been along this lower side of the Park ,
STURT-1890-2,1,111.529

and was quite happy , until disturbed , first by a big dog rustling at
play behind me , and then by the presence of two or three townsmen .
STURT-1890-2,1,111.530

I did@ @n't want to see them , STURT-1890-2,1,111.531

and was afraid of the dog , with a nervous ill-defined apprehension ,

I could@ @n't quite regain self-possession afterwards .
STURT-1890-2,1,111.535

Everything except the bare ground and the tree-stems seems grey with
rime . More dim and airy than snow , because it lines every twig
distinctly . STURT-1890-2,1,111.536

On the E. side of wooden palings it lines them with a white border
about half an inch {TEXT:half-an-inch} wide , leaving the remainder bare

The deer were congregated on this lower side of the Park , all facing

' High thinking ' is not a necessity , but a luxury , as much as High
Living and High Art , and other things unusual or beyond the common
experience . STURT-1890-2,1,112.547

It presupposes a wide foundation of every-day thought :
STURT-1890-2,1,112.548

or if not , how is it better than that ? STURT-1890-2,1,112.549

If deep philosophy were the usual thing , and thrift and practical
sagacity <font> unusual <$$font> , would not <font> these <$$font> be '

STURT-1890-2,1,112.550

From these also is ' reality ' visible STURT-1890-2,1,112.551

But we seem to have no common interests . STURT-1890-2,1,115.622

He is engaged to a girl - ' Sally ' - ? STURT-1890-2,1,115.623

Later came Catt , - full of <font> his <$$font> engagement <paren> A
contrast to Will , who has never said to me a word of his affair
<$$paren> . STURT-1890-2,1,115.624

Catt seems prepared for all opposition - STURT-1890-2,1,115.625

goes out to meet it and put it under him . So too in his dealings with
the School of Art Committee . STURT-1890-2,1,115.626

Seems to have a keen eye for what he <font> can <$$font> do and claim ,
STURT-1890-2,1,115.627

and takes up his position accordingly : sticking to it in a large
unyielding sort of way , with plenty of patience , and readiness in the
nick of time : whereby things and people tune themselves to the note he
strikes ... STURT-1890-2,1,115.628

But I am amazed at the light-hearted way in which these two seem to have
got themselves engaged ... STURT-1890-2,1,115.629

When Catt first told me of it , I tried honestly to tell him all I
thought about marriage - in the abstract . STURT-1890-2,1,115.630

Yet I feel , that - oh bother ! STURT-1890-2,1,115.631

... Perhaps an ill-defined feeling - looking upon him as a man , who
might in a few years have found himself with all his present ideas and
aspirations gone overboard . STURT-1890-2,1,115.632

<font> 18 December <$$font> <paren> Thursday <$$paren> 8.15 p._m.
STURT-1890-2,1,115.633

Another day indoors . STURT-1890-2,1,115.634

Plentiful flowing at the nose , and much use of numerous
pocket-handkerchiefs most of the time . STURT-1890-2,1,115.635

Now it is something of a toss-up , whether I shall presently get a
night's rest , or a touch of bronchitis . STURT-1890-2,1,115.636

<P_1,116>

Have been helping downstairs , with the shopwork .
STURT-1890-2,1,116.638

Utterly waste , all that . STURT-1890-2,1,116.639

All that is useful of it - all , that is , that helps in any way the
production of wealth , - <paren> say , the supply of business stationery
<$$paren> might probably have been done by one person in half an hour
{TEXT:half-an-hour} . STURT-1890-2,1,116.640

There have been <paren> counting boys and all <$$paren> not less than 70
hours spent over it today . STURT-1890-2,1,116.641

70 hours of life wasted , - not cut off the end of life , but blotted
out in the middle of it <paren> shortening the whole amount too , no
doubt <$$paren> . STURT-1890-2,1,116.642

People talk of the waste of life by war , disease , calamities of all
sorts ; STURT-1890-2,1,116.643

but what is it all , in comparison with the waste due to Business , that
ever-@ @raging epidemic ? STURT-1890-2,1,116.644

And then these poor rich people who buy ' presents ' , to snatch a
little momentary pleasure that way - what a dull empty life it must be
that causes them to do it ! STURT-1890-2,1,116.645

I thought today ; If I had real positive bodily health , that would
brave living out of doors always , I could dispense entirely with all
books , pictures , music and the rest of it . STURT-1890-2,1,116.646

I know it is a one-sided view : STURT-1890-2,1,116.647

but all these ' interests ' seemed like makeshifts - a kind of <font>
Tidman's Sea Salt <$$font> , medicinal , - for those who could@ @n't get
the real article . STURT-1890-2,1,116.648

Bottled Sunshine , Fresh Air , through a meter , forms so large a part
of Art , as though a man were married to a picture of his wife instead
of to the wife herself . STURT-1890-2,1,116.649

Is@ @n't this what Whitman has tried to teach ? STURT-1890-2,1,116.650

... And then , when all is said , Art remains , as something more than
all this , different in kind from Photography , whether in painting ,
Sculpture , Poetry , or whatever else . STURT-1890-2,1,116.651

It is the expression and communication of the conscious enjoyment of the
thing photographed , STURT-1890-2,1,116.652

and in its highest form , is no scientific diagram , description ,
reproduction , or copy in any way of the <font> thing seen <$$font> ,
but of the enjoyment of the Human Soul . STURT-1890-2,1,116.653

It is a manifestation of Joy , just as the colour in healthy cheeks is a
manifestation of the clean blood . STURT-1890-2,1,116.654

And in this sense , Art takes its place beside other realities , -
Soul-shine as real as Sun-shine . STURT-1890-2,1,116.655

It seems possible that , by growing conscious of Being Alive , one might
merely by an effort of will leave off living . STURT-1890-2,1,116.656

<font> {COM:editorial_material_omitted} STURT-1890-2,1,117.658

This morning I went with Susie up as far as the Grange .
STURT-1890-2,1,117.659

Beyond there , the snow was perhaps 5 inches deep ;
STURT-1890-2,1,117.660

and neither of us were anxious to go through it .
STURT-1890-2,1,117.661

The first time I had been out , since Tuesday evening .
STURT-1890-2,1,117.662

'T@ @was very nice , but not long enough to shake off the indoors
dullness . STURT-1890-2,1,117.663

My breath too proved wheezy and short . STURT-1890-2,1,117.664

The colour in distance , where snow was not clinging <paren> houses ,
trees , etc. <$$paren> was a very slight dim blue-grey .
STURT-1890-2,1,117.665

On the sycamores at Castle Steps , the bark was very beautiful ; green
predominating , but a wonderful mauve too , with blues , yellows , etc.
, all heightened and brilliant with light reflected from the snow .
STURT-1890-2,1,117.666

So too with greys and pinks and flaming red on brick and stone walls .
STURT-1890-2,1,117.667

This afternoon feel empty-headed ; STURT-1890-2,1,117.668

and have been reading Sanborn's ' Life of John Brown , Liberator of
Kansas ' . STURT-1890-2,1,117.669

<font> 23 December <$$font> <paren> Tuesday <$$paren> 6.30 a._m.
STURT-1890-2,1,117.670

Yesterday was the coldest day within my recollection .
STURT-1890-2,1,117.671

The clearing of the sky at sunset Sunday was a signal to cease for the
slight thaw that had set in that day : STURT-1890-2,1,117.672

and I felt the snow at the back-door crisp under my feet , later in the
evening , and in bright moonlight . STURT-1890-2,1,117.673

Our bedroom window , which had been clear all day Sunday , was quite
frozen over Monday morning , 'tho {COM:sic} we had gone to bed late ,
leaving a good fire in the grate . STURT-1890-2,1,117.674

I did@ @n't go out before breakfast ; STURT-1890-2,1,117.675

but after breakfast the men reported a thick fog , at 6 o'clock ;
STURT-1890-2,1,117.676

there was fog all the morning , though slight and variable : and a
consequent return of hoar-frost . STURT-1890-2,1,117.677

Lloyd reported a difficulty in finding his way across the Park , with
his newspapers , in consequence of the fog and snow .
STURT-1890-2,1,117.678

By dinner-time the sun looked through , STURT-1890-2,1,117.679

and the weather was afterwards clearer , so that we were prepared for
stinging frost last night . STURT-1890-2,1,117.680

I did@ @n't think our bedroom window just now indicated quite so intense
a cold . STURT-1890-2,1,117.681

Yesterday , at 10.30 , Borelli's Thermometer showed 13@ @=o= of frost :
STURT-1890-2,1,117.682

at 3 p._m. during the sunshine , though in the shade , it had <P_1,118>
risen to show only 12 : STURT-1890-2,1,118.683

but at 5.30 it had sunk again , to only 18@ @=o= above zero ,
STURT-1890-2,1,118.684

and an hour later had fallen to near 17@ @=o= . STURT-1890-2,1,118.685

I found the ink frozen in my office : - a thing I recollect only once
before : STURT-1890-2,1,118.686

and , what exceeds my experience , I was no sooner out of doors than my
moustache began to freeze , and would be quite stiff feeling , in 20
paces : excepting at 3.30 , when I had got nearly down to the shop in
East Street , before I felt it . STURT-1890-2,1,118.687

Had there been any wind we should have been in wretched plight .
STURT-1890-2,1,118.688

We had to put tires on a pair of wheels . STURT-1890-2,1,118.689

The tires generally when taken finally out of water are still too hot to
bear the hand on them : STURT-1890-2,1,118.690

but yesterday the wheels within five minutes were coated with ice .
<paren> The tires themselves of course dry <$$paren> .
STURT-1890-2,1,118.691

Porter said the water froze in the cans so fast , that they could not
finish cooling the second wheel , and were forced to use snow .
STURT-1890-2,1,118.692

<font> 25 December <$$font> <paren> Thursday <$$paren> 9.30 p._m.
STURT-1890-2,1,118.693

Still freezing very sharp . STURT-1890-2,1,118.694

Christmas Day , and so , a holiday . STURT-1890-2,1,118.695

The morning however , was mostly occupied with newspapers :
STURT-1890-2,1,118.696

but we rose late <paren> 9.30 <$$paren> , having been at work in the
shop until nearly 11 o'clock last night . STURT-1890-2,1,118.697

I have been very sleepy this evening STURT-1890-2,1,118.698

and gave myself up to it . STURT-1890-2,1,118.699

We eat as much as we want , STURT-1890-2,1,118.700

read as much , STURT-1890-2,1,118.701

smoke as much : STURT-1890-2,1,118.702

why should we not too rest as long as we desire ?
STURT-1890-2,1,118.703

We have a strange contempt for repose : STURT-1890-2,1,118.704

and any interference in that direction is strongly condemned .
STURT-1890-2,1,118.705

Perhaps there is nothing which meets with such general disapproval as
Idleness . STURT-1890-2,1,118.706

I am tempted to think that the discouragement of inactivity constitues a
sincere part of the religion of many estimable people .
STURT-1890-2,1,118.707

I have heard my men <paren> notably Will Hammond <$$paren> speak of any
idle man more harshly than of any other - not without wondering how much
they despise me for my lack of energy . STURT-1890-2,1,118.708

They have more sympathy for a drunkard , if he will work between his
drinking , than for a man habitually lazy ... STURT-1890-2,1,118.709

But this evening I deliberately chose laziness , persuading my intellect
to wait till the body was ready . STURT-1890-2,1,118.710

There must be something wrong with us who habitually <paren> I speak of
the people I know <$$paren> find either body or brain at fault , waiting
for the other to awaken . STURT-1890-2,1,118.711

We resemble a pair of sawyers , who can@ @not contrive to have their
<P_1,119> sober weeks simultaneously . STURT-1890-2,1,119.712

But we commonly despise rest : taking it as a necessary medicine , and
preparation for future activity . STURT-1890-2,1,119.713

We look upon it as a postponement of <font> living <$$font> ; an evil to
be reduced to a minimum . STURT-1890-2,1,119.714

Why not make it a <font> part <$$font> of living , a sweet experience ,
to be enjoyed seasonably , when required , like walking , eating ,
meditation , and so forth , and so round it in with the whole of our
existence ? STURT-1890-2,1,119.715

Frank is as sleepy now as I have been . STURT-1890-2,1,119.716

Probably the intense cold is partly accountable <font>
{COM:editorial_material_omitted} STURT-1890-2,1,119.717

The cold draws upon my mind <paren> it would seem <$$paren> in order to
balance the extra demand on vitality . STURT-1890-2,1,119.718

In my drowsy state tonight , I have had a slow succession of easy
thought , to occupy my mind <paren> not quite asleep <$$paren> ;
STURT-1890-2,1,119.719

the while my body rested stretched , log-like , before the fire .
STURT-1890-2,1,119.720

We have learnt to shut off the world outside , by thin walls of brick ;
STURT-1890-2,1,119.721

but still we gather round fires , like any hunter or savage in the woods
, STURT-1890-2,1,119.722

and are much of savages still . STURT-1890-2,1,119.723

<paren> Or rather , the savage encroaches very far into civilisation ,
with his fire <$$paren> . STURT-1890-2,1,119.724

The silent streets , as we came home , reminded us of the ancient
hearth-worship going on within the houses today .

<font> 26 December <$$font> <paren> Friday <$$paren> .
STURT-1890-2,1,119.726

This afternoon a thaw started ; STURT-1890-2,1,119.727

and the pavements are quite slushy this evening .
STURT-1890-2,1,119.728

Short letter from Jim this morning , asking me to go to Richmond : etc.
etc. STURT-1890-2,1,119.729

Ca@ @n't be yet . STURT-1890-2,1,119.730

Several very different things have become curiously connected in my mind
, yesterday and today . STURT-1890-2,1,119.731

In Sanborn's ' Life of John Brown ' there is a note comparing the
condition of Kansas in 1856 - 7 with the state of things in England and
Scotland , during the old Border Feuds . STURT-1890-2,1,119.732

I should imagine it a just comparison , and that the ' Border Ruffians '
of Kansas were no more ruffianly than our English and Scotch
predecessors . STURT-1890-2,1,119.733

It would be difficult to say , whether these types of character have
<paren> in Great Britain <$$paren> died out , supplanted by other habits
<font> from outside <$$font> ; or whether it was out of them ,
proceeding from them by a natural development that our civilised state
today has come . STURT-1890-2,1,119.734

Would the Slave-holders , without the <P_1,120> Northern Abolitionists ,
themselves have eventually relinquished slavery ?
STURT-1890-2,1,120.735

... The contemplation of Brown's character has shown me vividly how
helplessly we are the foster-children of circumstance .
STURT-1890-2,1,120.736

I find I can not approve of Brown's doings , nor disapprove .
STURT-1890-2,1,120.737

They simply do not concern me . STURT-1890-2,1,120.738

The state of an emigrant , breaking fresh ground , forcing a hard living
from nature , and in the teeth of murderous enemies , is one which I
find unthinkable , STURT-1890-2,1,120.739

and I might as well try to judge of policy among the Hottentots , as of
the Kansas Liberators . STURT-1890-2,1,120.740

I can see that <font> both <$$font> sides were right , from their
one-sided view : the Pro-Slavery men probably fearing , as the
bourgeoisie fear Socialism today , that Abolition would throw society
off the only rails it was possible to run on . STURT-1890-2,1,120.741

At any rate , there was the savagery : STURT-1890-2,1,120.742

did it contain any of the seeds of what we call ' good ' today ?
STURT-1890-2,1,120.743

Was it dead and damned or but a late survival ? STURT-1890-2,1,120.744

Was the wild beast but passing at a late era through one more
metamorphosis , before it should become Man ? STURT-1890-2,1,120.745

Then yesterday , in the snow by the roadside , alternated with religious
propaganda , ' Do you love Jesus ' and the like , there were traced one
or two obscene words : disgusting to the modern sense of decency .
STURT-1890-2,1,120.746

This sense is apparently a ' preconception ' varying much in different
races . STURT-1890-2,1,120.747

Spartan codes had@ @n't much resemblance to ours , by all accounts ,
STURT-1890-2,1,120.748

nor had those of England two centuries ago . STURT-1890-2,1,120.749

Some African tribes encourage what we consider shocking depravity ,
STURT-1890-2,1,120.750

but are horrified at the mention of a husband's name in the presence of
the wife . STURT-1890-2,1,120.751

The word is improper , as other words with us . STURT-1890-2,1,120.752

Curiously , they relate generally to affairs of sex .
STURT-1890-2,1,120.753

But , reading Rossetti's translation of the ' Early Italian Poets ' , I
found many pieces dealing with romantic love , and its fruition in the
sexual relation , which is the subject matter of English obscenity , in
these so delicately hinted at , that a Man like Rossetti loses the
poetry of it . STURT-1890-2,1,120.754

Chaucer found both poetry and humour in similar themes .
STURT-1890-2,1,120.755

Now , though the essence of Poetry , as of other art , is in perfect
expression or communication of delight <paren> ? <$$paren> ; yet behind
that <paren> unless it be hollow and unreal <P_1,121> poetry <$$paren>
there must be the delight to communicate . So that these delicate poets
and Rossetti are committed <paren> as why should they not be ?
<$$paren> to an appreciation of that , which to speak of would be
obscene , if the coarse expressions of the English ' blackguard ' were
made use of . STURT-1890-2,1,121.756

But , if culture consists in ' refinement ' - in a delicate appreciation
of beauties and suggestions that make no impress on the uncultured
<paren> as is my own case with music <$$paren> , then it may be that
this obscenity that offends the cultured by its crudity and ungentleness
, is to the uncultured a sort of rough-hewn poetry .
STURT-1890-2,1,121.757

It may contain the same elements <paren> much undeveloped <$$paren> of
appreciation , or else of humour , as Chaucer's poems .
STURT-1890-2,1,121.758

The paintings of some North_American Savages are said to be revoltingly
indecent to European eyes , yet innocent to the Indicans .
STURT-1890-2,1,121.759

The question therefore is similar to that raised by the doings in Kansas
: STURT-1890-2,1,121.760

are we to consider such things as uncultured savagery , containing
elements of civilisation , STURT-1890-2,1,121.761

or are they evidences of degeneration , as in the obscenities of Pompeii
? STURT-1890-2,1,121.762

If the latter , the result is death and misery : STURT-1890-2,1,121.763

but if the former ? STURT-1890-2,1,121.764

I incline to the more hopeful view : seeing so many survivals of
savagery amongst us . STURT-1890-2,1,121.765

This morning a man came to buy stationery to sell again - hawking
<paren> Atolycus-like <$$paren> from door to door in the villages .
STURT-1890-2,1,121.766

He had with him topical songs etc: including something <paren> whether
narrative or speech I do@ @n't know <$$paren> about the woman lately
hanged at Newgate . STURT-1890-2,1,121.767

He regretted his small stock of this particular sheet :
STURT-1890-2,1,121.768

had sold so many - STURT-1890-2,1,121.769

they did <font> take <$$font> so . STURT-1890-2,1,121.770

This sort of thing circulates amongst the healthiest class of people , -
the rural working class namely , who are in this neighbourhood poor
enough , yet <font> not <$$font> physically vicious ; and who have
moreover undergone a pretty rigorous selection , owing to their poverty
. STURT-1890-2,1,121.771

Yet they are intellectually quite undeveloped - barbarous , - almost
<font> primitive . <$$font> STURT-1890-2,1,121.772

And the idea of an execution , - the word itself too - is so suggestive
of Dahomey or Borneo . STURT-1890-2,1,121.773

The cultivated folk <paren> there are no cultured <font> classes
<$$font> : fashionable ladies were brutally fascinated by this
murder-trial <$$paren> have but lately emerged from this barbarism ;
STURT-1890-2,1,121.774

and here at least is an instance of apparent depravity being really the
rugged <P_1,122> husk of - STURT-1890-2,1,122.775

I was going to write , a truer happiness lying like a seed within .
STURT-1890-2,1,122.776

But this pedlar this morning made me doubtful , and conscious of a
partial view of happiness , resulting from environment .
STURT-1890-2,1,122.777

He certainly gets much pleasure , where I should be miserable , and
<font> vice_versa . <$$font> STURT-1890-2,1,122.778

By what standard can I compare the two , or say that my way is better
than his ? STURT-1890-2,1,122.779

Better <font> for me <$$font> , is the nearest I can get : which is but
a one-sided view , like that of the reformed drunkard , who knows that
total abstinence is best - for him . STURT-1890-2,1,122.780

' High-thinking ' might be useful here , to see these rival allurements
as from an elevated standpoint , where their proportions may be clearer
. STURT-1890-2,1,122.781

This pedlar is a character . STURT-1890-2,1,122.782

He likes frosty weather . STURT-1890-2,1,122.783

' I feels better , ye know ' , he says ; STURT-1890-2,1,122.784

then , muttering , ' better in health , at least ' : as though he felt
doubtful about his morals . STURT-1890-2,1,122.785

A happy-go-lucky man : who sometimes gets drunk , and wakes up , to his
own surprise , under a hedge . STURT-1890-2,1,122.786

He seems to have few cares : STURT-1890-2,1,122.787

can get <font> his <$$font> living without them : STURT-1890-2,1,122.788

and probably is rather indifferent about such trifles as doing a few
weeks in prison , if times are bad , or he feels tempted to steal .
STURT-1890-2,1,122.789

So at last I think of him , having strong suspicions that he is no
stranger to the gaol . STURT-1890-2,1,122.790

He is rich in the coin <paren> of endurance <$$paren> , that Society
exacts as payment for breaking its laws ; STURT-1890-2,1,122.791

and being ready always to pay his way , has no care .
STURT-1890-2,1,122.792

I do@ @n't think his qualms of conscience are very troublesome .
STURT-1890-2,1,122.793

He has learnt his way to live , as I mine . STURT-1890-2,1,122.794

If he lives that way , can I say he is wrong , even though I might
