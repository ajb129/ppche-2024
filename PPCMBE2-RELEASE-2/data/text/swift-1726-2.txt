Chap. I . SWIFT-1726-2,2,1.7

<font> The Author sets out on his Third Voyage ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,1.8

is taken by Pyrates . SWIFT-1726-2,2,1.9

The Malice of a <$$font> Dutchman . SWIFT-1726-2,2,1.10

<font> His Arrival at an Island . SWIFT-1726-2,2,1.11

He is received into <$$font> Laputa . SWIFT-1726-2,2,1.12

<$$heading>

I had not been at Home above ten Days , when Captain <font> William
Robinson , <$$font> a <font> Cornish <$$font> Man , Commander of the
<font> Hopewell , <$$font> a stout Ship of Three_Hundred <P_2,2> Tuns ,
came to my House . SWIFT-1726-2,2,2.14

I had formerly been Surgeon of another Ship where he was Master , and a
fourth Part Owner , in a Voyage to the <font> Levant ; <$$font>
SWIFT-1726-2,2,2.15

He had always treated me more like a Brother than an inferior Officer ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,2.16

and hearing of my Arrival made me a Visit , as I apprehended only out of
Friendship , SWIFT-1726-2,2,2.17

for nothing passed more than what is usual after long Absences . But
repeating his Visits often , expressing his Joy to find me in good
Health , asking whether I were now settled for Life , adding that he
intended a Voyage to the <font> East-Indies , <$$font> in two Months .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,2.18

At last he plainly invited me , though with some Apologies , to be
Surgeon of the Ship ; that I should have another Surgeon under me
besides our two Mates ; that my Salary {TEXT:Sallary} should be double
to the usual Pay , and that having experienced my Knowledge in
Sea-Affairs to be at least equal to his , he would enter into any
Engagement to follow my Advice , as much as if I had share in the
Command . SWIFT-1726-2,2,2.19

<P_2,3>

He said so many other obliging Things , and I knew him to be so honest a
Man , that I could not reject his Proposal ; the Thirst I had of seeing
the World , notwithstanding my past Misfortunes , continuing as violent
as ever . SWIFT-1726-2,2,3.21

The only Difficulty that remained , was to persuade my Wife , whose
Consent , however , I at last obtained by the Prospect of Advantage she
proposed to her Children . SWIFT-1726-2,2,3.22

We set out the 5th Day of <font> August , <$$font> 1706 .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,3.23

and arrived at Fort <font> St. George <$$font> the 11th of <font> April
, <$$font> 1707 . SWIFT-1726-2,2,3.24

stayed there three Weeks to refresh our Crew , many of whom were sick .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,3.25

From thence we went to <font> Tonquin , <$$font> where the Captain
resolved to continue some Time , because many of the Goods he intended
to buy were not ready , nor could he expect to be dispatched in some
Months . SWIFT-1726-2,2,3.26

Therefore in hopes to defray some of the Charges he must be at , he
bought a Sloop , SWIFT-1726-2,2,3.27

loaded it with several sorts of <P_2,4> Goods , wherewith the <font>
Tonquinese <$$font> usually trade to the neighbouring Islands ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,4.28

and putting fourteen Men on Board , whereof three were of the Country ,
he appointed me Master of the Sloop , SWIFT-1726-2,2,4.29

and gave me Power to traffick for two Months , while he transacted his
Affairs at <font> Tonquin . <$$font> SWIFT-1726-2,2,4.30

We had not sailed above three Days , when a great Storm arising , we
were driven five Days to the North-North-East , and then to the East ;
after which we had fair Weather , but still with a pretty strong Gale
from the West . SWIFT-1726-2,2,4.31

Upon the tenth Day we were chased by two Pyrates , who soon overtook us
; SWIFT-1726-2,2,4.32

for my Sloop was so deep loaden , that she sailed very slow ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,4.33

neither were we in a Condition to defend our selves .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,4.34

We were boarded about the same Time by both the Pyrates , who enter'd
furiously at the Head of their Men , SWIFT-1726-2,2,4.35

but finding us all prostrate upon our Faces , <P_2,5> <paren> for so I
gave order , <$$paren> they pinioned us with string Ropes ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,5.36

and setting a Guard upon us , went to search the Sloop .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,5.37

I observed among them a <font> Dutchman , <$$font> who seemed to be of
some Authority , though he was not Commander of either Ship .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,5.38

He knew us by our Countenances to be <font> Englishmen , <$$font>
SWIFT-1726-2,2,5.39

and jabbering to us in his own Language , swore we should be tied Back
to Back , and thrown into the Sea . SWIFT-1726-2,2,5.40

I spoke <font> Dutch <$$font> tolerably well ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,5.41

I told him who we were , SWIFT-1726-2,2,5.42

and begged him , in consideration of our being Christians and
Protestants , of neighbouring Countries , in strict Alliance , that he
would move the Captains to take some Pity on us . SWIFT-1726-2,2,5.43

This inflamed his Rage ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,5.44

he repeated his Threatnings , SWIFT-1726-2,2,5.45

and , turning to his Companions , spoke with great Vehemence , in the
<font> Japanese <$$font> Language , as I suppose , often using the Word
<font> Christianos . <$$font> SWIFT-1726-2,2,5.46

The largest of the two Pyrate Ships was commanded by a <font> Japanese
<$$font> Captain , <P_2,6> who spoke a little <font> Dutch , <$$font>
but very imperfectly . SWIFT-1726-2,2,6.47

He came up to me , SWIFT-1726-2,2,6.48

and after several Questions , which I answered in great Humility , he
said we should not die . SWIFT-1726-2,2,6.49

I made the Captain a very low Bow , SWIFT-1726-2,2,6.50

and then turning to the <font> Dutchman , <$$font> said , I was sorry to
find more Mercy in a Heathen , than in a Brother Christian .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,6.51

But I had soon Reason to repent those foolish Words ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,6.52

for that malicious Reprobate , having often endeavoured in vain to
persuade both the Captains that I might be thrown into the Sea , <paren>
which they would not yield to after the Promise made me , that I should
not die , <$$paren> however prevailed so far as to have a Punishment
inflicted on me , worse in all human Appearance than Death it self
{COM:sic} . SWIFT-1726-2,2,6.53

My Men were sent by an equal Division into both the Pirate-Ships , and
my Sloop new manned . SWIFT-1726-2,2,6.54

As to my self , it was determined that I should be set a drift in a
small Canoe , with Paddles and a Sail , and four Days Provisions , which
last the <font> Japanese <$$font> Captain <P_2,7> was so kind to double
out of his own Stores , and would permit no Man to search me .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,7.55

I got down into the Canoe , while the <font> Dutchman <$$font> standing
upon the Deck , loaded me with all the Curses and injurious Terms his
Language could afford . SWIFT-1726-2,2,7.56

About an Hour before we saw the Pirates , I had taken an Observation ,
and found we were in the Latitude of 46 N. and of Longitude 183 .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,7.57

When I was at some Distance from the Pirates , I discovered by my
Pocket-Glass several Islands to the South-East . SWIFT-1726-2,2,7.58

I set up my Sail , the Wind being fair , with a Design to reach the
nearest of those Islands , which I made a Shift to do in about three
Hours . SWIFT-1726-2,2,7.59

It was all rocky ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,7.60

however , I got many Birds Eggs , SWIFT-1726-2,2,7.61

and striking Fire I kindled some Heath and dry Sea-Weed , by which I
roasted my Eggs . SWIFT-1726-2,2,7.62

I eat no other Supper , being resolved to spare my Provisions as much as
I could . SWIFT-1726-2,2,7.63

I passed the Night under the Shelter of a Rock , <P_2,8> strowing some
Heath under me , SWIFT-1726-2,2,8.64

and slept pretty well . SWIFT-1726-2,2,8.65

The next Day I sailed to another Island , and thence to a third and
fourth , sometimes using my Sail , and sometimes my Paddles .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,8.66

But not to trouble the Reader with a particular Account of my Distresses
, let it suffice , that on the 5th Day I arrived at the last Island in
my Sight , which lay South-South-East to the former .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,8.67

This Island was at a greater Distance than I expected ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,8.68

and I did not reach it in less than five Hours . SWIFT-1726-2,2,8.69

I encompassed it almost round before I could find a convenient Place to
land in , which was a small Creek , about three Times the Wideness of my
Canoe . SWIFT-1726-2,2,8.70

I found the Island to be all rocky , only a little intermingled with
Tufts of Grass , and sweet-smelling Herbs . SWIFT-1726-2,2,8.71

I took out my small Provisions , SWIFT-1726-2,2,8.72

and after having refreshed my self , I secured the Remainder <P_2,9> in
a Cave , whereof there were great Numbers . SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.73

I gathered plenty of Eggs upon the Rocks , SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.74

and got a Quantity of dry Sea-Weed and parched Grass , which I designed
to kindle the next Day , and roast my Eggs as well as I could .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.75

<paren> For I had about me my Flint , Steel , Match , and Burning-Glass
. <$$paren> SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.76

I lay all Night in the Cave where I had lodged my Provisions .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.77

My Bed was the same dry Grass and Sea-weed which I intended for Fewel .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.78

I slept very little , SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.79

for the Disquiets of my Mind prevailed over my Weariness ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.80

and kept me awake . SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.81

I considered how impossible it was to preserve my Life in so desolate a
Place , and how miserable my End must be . SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.82

Yet I found my self so listless and desponding , that I had not the
Heart to rise , and before I could get Spirits enough to creep out of my
Cave , the Day was far advanced . SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.83

I walked a while among the Rocks ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,9.84

the Sky was perfectly clear , and the Sun so hot , that I was forced to
turn my Face from it : When all on a sudden <P_2,10> it became obscured
, as I thought , in a Manner very different from what happens by the
Interposition of a Cloud . SWIFT-1726-2,2,10.85

I turned back , SWIFT-1726-2,2,10.86

and perceived a vast Opake Body between me and the Sun , moving forwards
towards the Island : SWIFT-1726-2,2,10.87

It seemed to be about two Miles high , SWIFT-1726-2,2,10.88

and hid the Sun six or seven Minutes ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,10.89

but I did not observe the Air to be much colder , or the Sky more
darkned , than if I had stood under the Shade of a Mountain .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,10.90

As it approached nearer over the Place where I was , it appeared to be a
firm Substance , the Bottom flat , smooth , and shining very bright from
the Reflection of the Sea below . SWIFT-1726-2,2,10.91

I stood upon a Height about two_hundred Yards from the Shoar ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,10.92

and saw this vast Body descending almost to a Parallel with me , at less
than an <font> English <$$font> Mile distance . SWIFT-1726-2,2,10.93

I took out my Pocket-Perspective , SWIFT-1726-2,2,10.94

and could plainly discover Numbers of People moving up and down the
Sides of it , which appeared to be sloping , SWIFT-1726-2,2,10.95

but <P_2,11> what those People were doing , I was not able to
distinguish . SWIFT-1726-2,2,11.96

The natural Love of Life gave me some inward Motions of Joy ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,11.97

and I was ready to entertain a Hope , that this Adventure might some Way
or other help to deliver me from the desolate Place and Condition I was
in . SWIFT-1726-2,2,11.98

But at the same Time the Reader can hardly conceive my Astonishment , to
behold an Island in the Air , inhabited by Men , who were able , <paren>
as it should seem , <$$paren> to raise , or sink , or put it into a
Progressive Motion , as they pleased . SWIFT-1726-2,2,11.99

But not being at that Time in a Disposition to philosophise upon this
Phaenomenon , I rather chose to observe what Course the Island would
take , because it seemed for a while to stand still .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,11.100

Yet soon after it advanced nearer , SWIFT-1726-2,2,11.101

and I could see the Sides of it encompassed with several Gradations of
Galleries and Stairs , at certain Intervals , to descend from one to the
other . SWIFT-1726-2,2,11.102

In the lowest Gallery I <P_2,12> beheld some People fishing with long
Angling Rods , and others looking on . SWIFT-1726-2,2,12.103

I waved my Cap , <paren> for my Hat was long since worn out , <$$paren>
and my Handkerchief towards the Island ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,12.104

and , upon its nearer Approach , I called and shouted with the utmost
Strength of my Voice , SWIFT-1726-2,2,12.105

and then looking circumspectly , I beheld a Crowd gathered to that Side
which was most in my View . SWIFT-1726-2,2,12.106

I found by their pointing towards me , and to each other , that they
plainly discovered me , although they made no Return to my Shouting .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,12.107

But I could see four or five Men running in great Haste up the Stairs to
the Top of the Island , who then disappeared . SWIFT-1726-2,2,12.108

I happened rightly to conjecture , that these were sent for Orders to
some Person in Authority upon this Occasion . SWIFT-1726-2,2,12.109

The Number of People increased , SWIFT-1726-2,2,12.110

and in less than half an Hour the Island was moved and raised in such a
Manner , that the lowest Gallery appeared in a Parallel of less than
an_Hundred Yards <P_2,13> distance from the Height where I stood .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,13.111

I then put my self into the most supplicating Postures ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,13.112

and spoke in the humblest Accent , SWIFT-1726-2,2,13.113

but received no Answer . SWIFT-1726-2,2,13.114

Those who stood nearest over-@ @against me , seemed to be Persons of
Distinction , as I supposed by their Habit . SWIFT-1726-2,2,13.115

They conferred earnestly with each other , looking often upon me .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,13.116

At length one of them called out in a clear , polite , smooth Dialect ,
not unlike in Sound to the <font> Italian ; <$$font>
SWIFT-1726-2,2,13.117

and therefore I returned an Answer in that Language , hoping at least
that the Cadence might be more agreeable to his Ears .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,13.118

Although neither of us understood the other , yet my Meaning was easily
known , SWIFT-1726-2,2,13.119

for the People saw the Distress I was in . SWIFT-1726-2,2,13.120

They made Signs for me to come down from the Rock , and go towards the
Shoar , which I accordingly did ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,13.121

and the flying Island being raised to a convenient Height , the Verge
directly over me , <P_2,14> a Chain was let down from the lowest Gallery
, with a Seat fasten'd to the Bottom , to which I fixed my self , and
was drawn up by Pullies . SWIFT-1726-2,2,14.122

<$$heading>

At my alighting I was surrounded by a Crowd of People ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,15.132

but those who stood nearest seemed to be of better Quality .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,15.133

They beheld me with all the Marks and Circumstances of Wonder ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,15.134

neither , indeed , was I much in their Debt , having never till then
seen a Race of Mortals so singular in their <P_2,16> Shapes , Habits ,
and Countenances . SWIFT-1726-2,2,16.135

Their Heads were all reclined either to the Right , or the Left ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,16.136

one of their Eyes turned inward , and the other directly up to the
Zenith . SWIFT-1726-2,2,16.137

Their outward Garments were adorned with the Figures of Suns , Moons ,
and Stars , interwoven with those of Fiddles , Flutes , Harps , Trumpets
, Guitars {TEXT:Guittars} , Harpsicords , and many more Instruments of
Musick , unknown to us in <font> Europe . <$$font>
SWIFT-1726-2,2,16.138

I observed here and there many in the Habit of Servants , with a blown
Bladder fasten'd like a Flail to the End of a short Stick , which they
carried in their Hands . SWIFT-1726-2,2,16.139

In each Bladder was a small Quantity of dried Pease , or little Pebbles
, <paren> as I was afterwards informed . <$$paren>
SWIFT-1726-2,2,16.140

With these Bladders they now and then flapped the Mouths and Ears of
those who stood near them , of which Practice I could not then conceive
the Meaning : SWIFT-1726-2,2,16.141

It seems , the Minds of these People are so taken up with intense
Speculations , that they neither can speak , nor attend to the
Discourses of others , without being <P_2,17> rouzed by some external
Taction upon the Organs of Speech and Hearing ; for which Reason , those
Persons who are able to afford it always keep a <font> Flapper <$$font>
<paren> the Original is <font> Climenole <$$font> <$$paren> in their
Family , as one of their Domesticks , nor ever walk abroad or make
Visits without him . SWIFT-1726-2,2,17.142

And the Business of this Officer is , when two or three more Persons are
in Company , gently to strike with his Bladder the Mouth of him who is
to speak , and the right Ear of him or them to whom the Speaker
addresseth himself . SWIFT-1726-2,2,17.143

This <font> Flapper <$$font> is likewise employed diligently to attend
his Master in his Walks , and , upon occasion , to give him a soft Flap
on his Eyes , because he is always so wrapped up in Cogitation , that he
is in manifest Danger of falling down every Precipice , and bouncing his
Head against every Post , and in the Streets of justling others , or
being justled himself into the Kennel . SWIFT-1726-2,2,17.144

<P_2,18>

It was necessary to give the Reader this Information , without which he
would be at the same Loss with me , to understand the Proceedings of
these People , as they conducted me up the Stairs , to the Top of the
Island , and from thence to the Royal Palace . SWIFT-1726-2,2,18.146

While we were ascending , they forgot several Times what they were about
, SWIFT-1726-2,2,18.147

and left me to my self , till their Memories were again rouzed by their
<font> Flappers ; <$$font> SWIFT-1726-2,2,18.148

for they appeared altogether unmoved by the Sight of my foreign Habit
and Countenance , and by the Shouts of the Vulgar , whose Thoughts and
Minds were more disengaged . SWIFT-1726-2,2,18.149

At last we enter'd the Palace , SWIFT-1726-2,2,18.150

and proceeded into the Chamber of Presence , where I saw the King seated
on his Throne , attended on each Side by Persons of Prime Quality .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,18.151

Before the Throne , was a large Table filled with Globes and Spheres ,
and Mathematical Instruments of all Kinds . SWIFT-1726-2,2,18.152

His Majesty <P_2,19> took not the least Notice of us , although our
Entrance was not without sufficient Noise , by the Concourse of all
Persons belonging to the Court . SWIFT-1726-2,2,19.153

But he was then deep in a Problem , SWIFT-1726-2,2,19.154

and we attended at least an Hour , before he could solve it .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,19.155

There stood by him on each Side , a young Page , with Flaps in their
Hands , SWIFT-1726-2,2,19.156

and when they saw he was at Leisure , one of them gently struck his
Mouth , and the other his right Ear , at which he started like one
awaked on the sudden , and looking towards me , and the Company I was in
, recollected the Occasion of our coming , whereof he had been informed
before . SWIFT-1726-2,2,19.157

He spoke some Words , whereupon immediately a young Man with a Flap came
up to my Side , and flapt me gently on the right Ear ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,19.158

but I made Signs , as well as I could , that I had no Occasion for such
an Instrument ; which as I afterwards found gave his Majesty and the
whole Court a very mean Opinion of my Understanding .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,19.159

The King , as far as I could conjecture , <P_2,20> asked me several
Questions , SWIFT-1726-2,2,20.160

and I addressed my self to him in all the Languages I had .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,20.161

When it was found , that I could neither understand , nor be understood
, I was conducted , by the King's Order , to an Apartment in his Palace
, <paren> this Prince being distinguished above all his Predecessors for
his Hospitality to Strangers , <$$paren> where two Servants were
appointed to attend me . SWIFT-1726-2,2,20.162

My Dinner was brought , SWIFT-1726-2,2,20.163

and four Persons of Quality , whom I remember'd to have seen very near
the King's Person , did me the Honour to dine with me .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,20.164

We had two Courses , of three Dishes each . SWIFT-1726-2,2,20.165

In the first Course there was a Shoulder of Mutton , cut into an
Aequilateral Triangle , a Piece of Beef into a Rhomboides , and a
Pudding into a Cycloid . SWIFT-1726-2,2,20.166

The second Course was two Ducks , trussed up into the Form of Fiddles ,
Sausages and Puddings resembling Flutes and Hautboys , and a Breast of
Veal in the Shape of a Harp . SWIFT-1726-2,2,20.167

The Servants cut our Bread into <P_2,21> Cones , Cylinders ,
Parallelograms , and several other mathematical Figures .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,21.168

While we were at Dinner , I made bold to ask the Names of several Things
in their Language , SWIFT-1726-2,2,21.169

and those noble Persons , by the Assistance of their <font> Flappers ,
<$$font> delighted to give me Answers , hoping to raise my Admiration of
their great Abilities , if I could be brought to converse with them .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,21.170

I was soon able to call for Bread , and Drink , or whatever else I
wanted . SWIFT-1726-2,2,21.171

After Dinner my Company withdrew , SWIFT-1726-2,2,21.172

and a Person was sent to me by the King's Order , attended by a <font>
Flapper . <$$font> SWIFT-1726-2,2,21.173

He brought with him Pen , Ink , and Paper , and three or four Books ,
giving me to understand by Signs , that he was sent to teach me the
Language . SWIFT-1726-2,2,21.174

We sat together four Hours , in which Time I wrote down a great Number
of Words in Columns , with the Translations over against them .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,21.175

I likewise made a Shift to learn several <P_2,22> short Sentences .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,22.176

For my Tutor would order one of my Servants to fetch something , or turn
about , to make a Bow , to sit , or stand , or walk , and the like .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,22.177

Then I took down the Sentence in writing . SWIFT-1726-2,2,22.178

He shewed me also in one of his Books , the Figures of the Sun , Moon ,
and Stars , the Zodiack , the Tropics , and Polar Circles , together
with the Denominations of many Figures of Planes and Solids .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,22.179

He gave me the Names and Descriptions of all the musical Instruments ,
and the general Terms of Art in playing on each of them .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,22.180

After he had left me , I placed all my Words with their Interpretations
in Alphabetical Order . SWIFT-1726-2,2,22.181

And thus in a few Days , by the help of a very faithful Memory , I got
some Insight into their Language . SWIFT-1726-2,2,22.182

The Word , which I interpret the <font> Flying <$$font> or <font>
Floating Island , <$$font> is in the Original <font> Laputa , <$$font>
whereof I could never learn the true Etymology . SWIFT-1726-2,2,22.183

<font> Lap <$$font> in the old obsolete Language signifieth <font> High
, <$$font> <P_2,23> and <font> Untuh <$$font> a Governor , from which ,
they say , by Corruption was derived <font> Laputa <$$font> from <font>
Lapuntuh . <$$font> SWIFT-1726-2,2,23.184

But I do not approve of this Derivation , which seems to be a little
strained . SWIFT-1726-2,2,23.185

I ventured to offer to the Learned among them a Conjecture of my own ,
that <font> Laputa <$$font> was <font> quasi Lap outed , Lap <$$font>
signifying properly the Dancing of the Sun-Beams in the Sea , and <font>
outed <$$font> a Wing ; which , however , I shall not obtrude , but
submit to the judicious Reader . SWIFT-1726-2,2,23.186

Those to whom the King had entrusted me , observing how ill I was clad ,
ordered a Taylor to come next Morning , and take my Measure for a Suit
of Clothes . SWIFT-1726-2,2,23.187

This Operator did his Office after a different manner from those of his
Trade in <font> Europe . <$$font> SWIFT-1726-2,2,23.188

He first took my Altitude by a Quadrant , SWIFT-1726-2,2,23.189

and then with Rule and Compasses , described the Dimensions and Outlines
{TEXT:Out-lines} of my whole Body , all which he enter'd upon Paper ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,23.190

and in six Days brought my Clothes very ill made , and <P_2,24> quite
out of shape , by happening to mistake a Figure in the Calculation .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,24.191

But my Comfort was , that I observed such Accidents very frequent , and
little regarded . SWIFT-1726-2,2,24.192

During my Confinement for want of Clothes , and by an Indisposition that
held me some Days longer , I much enlarged my Dictionary ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,24.193

and when I went next to Court , was able to understand many Things the
King spoke , and to return him some kind of Answers .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,24.194

His Majesty had given Orders that the Island should move North-East and
by East , to the Vertical Point over <font> Lagado , <$$font> the
Metropolis of the whole Kingdom below upon the firm Earth .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,24.195

It was about ninety Leagues distant , SWIFT-1726-2,2,24.196

and our Voyage lasted four Days and an half . SWIFT-1726-2,2,24.197

I was not in the least sensible of the progressive Motion made in the
Air by the Island . SWIFT-1726-2,2,24.198

On the second Morning , about Eleven a-Clock , the King himself in
Person , attended by his Nobility , <P_2,25> Courtiers , and Officers ,
having prepared all their musical Instruments , played on them for three
Hours without Intermission , so that I was quite stunned with the Noise
; SWIFT-1726-2,2,25.199

neither could I possibly guess the Meaning till my Tutor informed me .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,25.200

He said that the People of their Island had their Ears adapted to hear
the Musick of the Spheres , which always played at certain Periods , and
the Court was now prepared to bear their Part in what ever Instrument
they most excelled . SWIFT-1726-2,2,25.201

In our Journey towards <font> Lagado <$$font> the capital City , his
Majesty ordered that the Island should stop over certain Towns and
Villages , from whence he might receive the Petitions of his Subjects .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,25.202

And to this Purpose several Packthreads were let down with small Weights
at the Bottom . SWIFT-1726-2,2,25.203

On these Packthreads the People strung their Petitions , which mounted
up directly like the Scraps of Paper fastned by School-Boys at the End
of the String <P_2,26> that holds their Kite . SWIFT-1726-2,2,26.204

Sometimes we received Wine and Victuals from below , which were drawn up
by Pullies . SWIFT-1726-2,2,26.205

The Knowledge I had in Mathematicks gave me great Assistance in
acquiring their Phraseology , which depended much upon that Science and
Musick ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,26.206

and in the latter I was not unskilled . SWIFT-1726-2,2,26.207

Their Ideas are perpetually conversant in Lines and Figures .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,26.208

If they would , for Example , praise the Beauty of a Woman , or any
other Animal , they describe it by Rhombs , Circles , Parallelograms ,
Ellipses , and other Geometrical Terms , or by Words of Art drawn from
Musick , needless here to repeat . SWIFT-1726-2,2,26.209

I observed in the King's Kitchen all Sorts of mathematical and musical
Instruments , after the Figures of which they cut up the Joints that
were served to his Majesty's Table . SWIFT-1726-2,2,26.210

Their Houses are very ill built , SWIFT-1726-2,2,26.211

the Walls bevil , without one Right <P_2,27> Angle in any Apartment ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,27.212

and this Defect ariseth from the Contempt they bear to practical
Geometry , which they despise , as Vulgar and Mechanick , those
Instructions they give being too refined for the Intellectuals of their
Workmen ; which occasions perpetual Mistakes . SWIFT-1726-2,2,27.213

And although they are dextrous enough upon a Piece of Paper in the
Management of the Rule , the Pencil , and the Divider , yet in the
common Actions and Behaviour of Life , I have not seen a more clumsy ,
awkward , and unhandy People , nor so slow and perplexed in their
Conceptions upon all other Subjects , except those of Mathematicks and
Musick . SWIFT-1726-2,2,27.214

They are very bad Reasoners , and vehemently given to Opposition ,
unless when they happen to be of the right Opinion , which is seldom
their Case . SWIFT-1726-2,2,27.215

Imagination , Fancy , and Invention , they are wholly Strangers to ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,27.216

nor have any Words in their Language by which those Ideas can be
expressed ; the whole Compass of their Thoughts <P_2,28> and Mind being
shut up within the two forementioned Sciences . SWIFT-1726-2,2,28.217

Most of them , and especially those who deal in the Astronomical Part ,
have great Faith in judicial Astrology , although they are ashamed to
own it publickly . SWIFT-1726-2,2,28.218

But what I chiefly admired , and thought altogether unaccountable , was
the strong Disposition I observed in them towards News and Politicks ,
perpetually enquiring into publick Affairs , giving their Judgments in
Matters of State , and passionately disputing every Inch of a Party
Opinion . SWIFT-1726-2,2,28.219

I have indeed observed the same Disposition among most of the
Mathematicians I have known in <font> Europe , <$$font> although I could
never discover the least Analogy between the two Sciences , unless those
People suppose , that because the smallest Circle hath as many Degrees
as the largest , therefore the Regulation and Management of the World
require no more Abilities than the handling and turning <P_2,29> of a
Globe . SWIFT-1726-2,2,29.220

But , I rather take this Quality to spring from a very common Infirmity
of human Nature , inclining us to be more curious and conceited in
Matters where we have least Concern , and for which we are least adapted
either by Study or Nature . SWIFT-1726-2,2,29.221

These People are under continual Disquietudes , never enjoying a
Minute's Peace of Mind ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,29.222

and their Disturbances proceed from Causes which very little affect the
rest of Mortals . SWIFT-1726-2,2,29.223

Their Apprehensions arise from several Changes they dread in the
celestial Bodies . For Instance ; That the Earth by the continual
Approaches of the Sun towards it , must in Course of Time be absorbed or
swallowed up . That the Face of the Sun will , by degrees , be
encrusted with its own Effluvia , and give no more Light to the World .
That the Earth very narrowly escaped a Brush from the Tail of the last
Comet , which would have infallibly reduced it to Ashes ; and that
<P_2,30> the next , which they have calculated for one_and_thirty Years
hence , will probably destroy us . For , if in its Perihelion it should
approach within a certain Degree of the Sun , <paren> as by their
Calculations they have Reason to dread {COM:missing_close_paren} , it
will conceive a Degree of Heat ten_thousand times more intense than that
of red-hot glowing Iron ; and in its Absence from the Sun , carry a
blazing Tail ten_hundred_thousand_and_fourteen Miles long ; through
which , if the Earth should pass at the Distance of one_hundred_thousand
Miles from the <font> Nucleus <$$font> or main Body of the Comet , it
must in its Passage be set on fire , and reduced to Ashes . That the
Sun daily spending its Rays without any Nutriment to supply them , will
at last be wholly consumed and annihilated ; which must be attended with
the Destruction of this Earth , and of all the Planets that receive
their Light from it . SWIFT-1726-2,2,30.224

<P_2,31>

They are so perpetually alarmed with the Apprehensions of these and the
like impending Dangers , that they can neither sleep quietly in their
Beds , nor have any Relish for the common Pleasures or Amusements of
Life . SWIFT-1726-2,2,31.226

When they meet an Acquaintance in the Morning , the first Question is
about the Sun's Health , how he looked at his Setting and Rising , and
what Hopes they have to avoid the Stroke of the approaching Comet .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,31.227

This Conversation they are apt to run into with the same Temper that
Boys discover , in delighting to hear terrible Stories of Spirits and
Hobgoblins , which they greedily listen to , and dare not go to Bed for
fear . SWIFT-1726-2,2,31.228

The Women of the Island have Abundance of Vivacity ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,31.229

they contemn their Husbands , SWIFT-1726-2,2,31.230

and are exceedingly fond of Strangers , whereof there is always a
considerable Number from the Continent below , attending at Court ,
either upon Affairs of the several Towns <P_2,32> and Corporations , or
their own particular Occasions , but are much despised , because they
want the same Endowments . SWIFT-1726-2,2,32.231

Among these the Ladies chuse their Gallants : SWIFT-1726-2,2,32.232

But the Vexation is , that they act with too much Ease and Security ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,32.233

for the Husband is always so wrapt in Speculation , that the Mistress
and Lover may proceed to the greatest Familiarities before his Face , if
he be but provided with Paper and Implements , and without his Flapper
at his Side . SWIFT-1726-2,2,32.234

The Wives and Daughters lament their Confinement to the Island ,
although I think it the most delicious Spot of Ground in the World ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,32.235

and although they live here in the greatest Plenty and Magnificence ,
and are allowed to do whatever they please , they long to see the World
, and take the Diversions of the Metropolis , which they are not allowed
to do without a particular Licence from the King ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,32.236

and this is not easy to be obtained , because the People of Quality
<P_2,33> have found , by frequent Experience , how hard it is to
persuade their Women to return from below . SWIFT-1726-2,2,33.237

I was told that a great Court-Lady , who had several Children , is
married to the Prime Minister , the richest Subject in the Kingdom , a
very graceful Person , extremely fond of her , and lives in the finest
Palace of the Island , went down to <font> Lagado , <$$font> on the
Pretence of Health , there hid her self for several Months , till the
King sent a Warrant to search for her , and she was found in an obscure
Eating-house all in Rags , having pawned her Clothes to maintain an old
deformed Footman , who beat her every Day , and in whose Company she was
taken much against her Will . SWIFT-1726-2,2,33.238

And although her Husband received her with all possible Kindness , and
without the least Reproach , she soon after contrived to steal down
again , with all her Jewels , to the same Gallant ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,33.239

and hath not been heard of since . SWIFT-1726-2,2,33.240

<P_2,34>

This may , perhaps , pass with the Reader rather for an <font> European
<$$font> or <font> English <$$font> Story , than for one of a Country so
remote : SWIFT-1726-2,2,34.242

But he may please to consider , that the Caprices of Womenkind are not
limited by any Climate or Nation , and that they are much more uniform
than can be easily imagined . SWIFT-1726-2,2,34.243

In about a Month's Time I had made a tolerable Proficiency in their
Language , SWIFT-1726-2,2,34.244

and was able to answer most of the King's Questions , when I had the
Honour to attend him . SWIFT-1726-2,2,34.245

His Majesty discovered not the least Curiosity to enquire into the Laws
, Government , History , Religion , or Manners of the Countries where I
had been , SWIFT-1726-2,2,34.246

but confined his Questions to the State of Mathematicks ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,34.247

and received the Account I gave him , with great Contempt and
Indifference , though often rouzed by his <font> Flapper <$$font> on
each Side . SWIFT-1726-2,2,34.248

SWIFT-1726-2,2,35.254

<$$heading>

I desired leave of this Prince to see the Curiosities of the Island ,
which he was graciously pleased to grant , and ordered my Tutor to
attend me . SWIFT-1726-2,2,35.256

I chiefly wanted to know to what Cause in Art , or in Nature , it owed
its Several Motions , whereof I will now give a Philosophical Account to
the Reader . SWIFT-1726-2,2,35.257

The Flying or Floating Island is exactly circular , its Diameter 7837
Yards , or about four Miles and an <P_2,36> half , SWIFT-1726-2,2,36.258

and consequently contains ten_thousand Acres . SWIFT-1726-2,2,36.259

It is three_hundred Yards thick . SWIFT-1726-2,2,36.260

The Bottom or under Surface , which appears to those who view it from
below is one even regular Plate of Adamant , shooting up to the Height
of about two_hundred Yards . SWIFT-1726-2,2,36.261

Above it lie the several Minerals in their usual Order ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,36.262

and over all is a Coat of rich Mould ten or twelve Foot deep .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,36.263

This Declivity of the upper Surface , from the Circumference to the
Center , is the natural Cause why all the Dews and Rains which fall upon
the Island , are conveyed in small Rivulets towards the Middle , where
they are emptied into four large Basons , each of about half a Mile in
Circuit , and two_hundred Yards distant from the Center .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,36.264

From these Basons the Water is continually exhaled by the Sun in the
Day-time , which effectually prevents their overflowing .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,36.265

Besides , as it is in the Power of the Monarch to raise the Island above
the Region of Clouds and Vapours , <P_2,37> he can prevent the falling
of Dews and Rains when=ever he pleases : SWIFT-1726-2,2,37.266

For the highest Clouds can@ @not rise above two Miles , as Naturalists
agree , SWIFT-1726-2,2,37.267

at least they were never known to do in that Country .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,37.268

At the Center of the Island there is a Chasm about fifty Yards in
Diameter , from whence the Astronomers descend into a large Dome , which
is therefore called <font> Flandona Gagnole <$$font> , or the <font>
Astronomers Cave <$$font> , situated at the Depth of a_hundred Yards
beneath the upper Surface of the Adamant . SWIFT-1726-2,2,37.269

In this Cave are twenty Lamps continually burning , which from the
Reflection of the Adamant cast a strong Light into every Part .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,37.270

The Place is stored with great Variety of Sextants , Quadrants ,
Telescopes , Astrolabes , and other Astronomical Instruments .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,37.271

But the greatest Curiosity , upon which the Fate of the Island depends ,
is a Load-stone of a prodigious Size , in Shape resembling a Weaver's
Shuttle , SWIFT-1726-2,2,37.272

It <P_2,38> is in Length six Yards , and in the thickest Part at least
three Yards over . SWIFT-1726-2,2,38.273

This Magnet is sustained by a very strong Axle of Adamant passing
through its Middle , upon which it plays , SWIFT-1726-2,2,38.274

and is poized so exactly , that the weakest Hand can turn it .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,38.275

It is hooped round with an hollow Cylinder of Adamant , four Foot deep ,
as many thick , and twelve Yards in Diameter , placed Horizontally , and
supported by eight Adamantine Feet , each six Yards high .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,38.276

In the middle of the Concave Side there is a Groove twelve Inches deep ,
in which the Extremities of the Axle are lodged , and turned round as
there {TEXT:therr} is Occasion . SWIFT-1726-2,2,38.277

The Stone can@ @not be moved from its Place by any Force , because the
Hoop and its Feet are one continued Piece with that Body of Adamant ,
which constitutes the Bottom of the Island . SWIFT-1726-2,2,38.278

<P_2,39>

By Means of this Load-stone , the Island is made to rise and fall , and
move from one Place to another . SWIFT-1726-2,2,39.280

For , with Respect to that Part of the Earth over which the Monarch
presides , the Stone is endued at one of its Sides with an attractive
Power , and at the other with a repulsive . SWIFT-1726-2,2,39.281

Upon placing the Magnet erect with its attracting End towards the Earth
, the Island descends ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,39.282

but when the repelling Extremity points downwards , the Island mounts
directly upwards . SWIFT-1726-2,2,39.283

When the Position of the Stone is oblique , the Motion of the Island is
so too . SWIFT-1726-2,2,39.284

For in this Magnet the Forces always act in Lines parallel to its
Direction . SWIFT-1726-2,2,39.285

By this oblique Motion the Island is conveyed to different Parts of the
Monarch's Dominions . SWIFT-1726-2,2,39.286

To explain the manner of its Progress , let <font> A B <$$font>
represent a Line drawn cross the Dominions of <font> Balnibarbi <$$font>
, SWIFT-1726-2,2,39.287

let the Line <font> c d <$$font> represent <P_2,40> the Load-stone , of
which let <font> d <$$font> be the repelling End , and <font> c <$$font>
the attracting End ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,40.288

the island being over <font> C <$$font> , let the Stone be placed in the
Position <font> c d <$$font> , with its repelling End downwards ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,40.289

then the Island will be driven upwards obliquely towards <font> D .
<$$font> SWIFT-1726-2,2,40.290

When it is arrived at <font> D <$$font> , let the Stone be turned upon
its Axle till its attracting End points towards <font> E <$$font> ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,40.291

and then the Island will be carried obliquely towards <font> E <$$font>
; where , if the Stone be again turned upon its Axle till it stands in
the Position <font> E F <$$font> , with its repelling Point downwards ,
the Island will rise obliquely towards <font> F <$$font> ; where , by
directing the attracting End towards <font> G <$$font> , the Island may
be carried to <font> G <$$font> , and from <font> G <$$font> to <font> H
<$$font> , by turning the Stone , so as to make its repelling Extremity
point directly downwards . SWIFT-1726-2,2,40.292

And thus by changing the Situation of the Stone as often as there is
Occasion , the Island is made to rise and fall by Turns in an oblique
Direction ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,40.293

and by those alternate Risings and Fallings <paren> the Obliquity being
not considerable <$$paren> <P_2,41> is conveyed from one Part of the
Dominions to the other . SWIFT-1726-2,2,41.294

But it must be observed , that this Island can@ @not move beyond the
Extent of the Dominions below , nor can it rise above the Height of four
Miles . For which the Astronomers <paren> who have writ ten large
Systems concerning the Stone <$$paren> assign the following Reason ;
That the magnetick Virtue does not extend beyond the Distance of four
Miles , and that the Mineral which acts upon the Stone in the Bowels of
the Earth , and in the Sea about six Leagues distant from the Shoar , is
not diffused through the whole Globe , but terminated with the Limits of
the King's Dominions ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,41.295

and it was easy from the great Advantage of such a superior Situation ,
for a Prince to bring under his Obedience whatever Country lay within
the Attraction of that Magnet . SWIFT-1726-2,2,41.296

<P_2,42>

When the Stone is put parallel to the Plane of the Horizon , the Island
standeth still ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,42.298

for in that Case , the Extremities of it being at equal Distance from
the Earth , act with equal Force , the one in drawing downwards , the
other in pushing upwards , SWIFT-1726-2,2,42.299

and consequently no Motion can ensue . SWIFT-1726-2,2,42.300

This Load-stone is under the Care of certain Astronomers , who from Time
to Time give it such Positions as the Monarch directs .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,42.301

They spend the greatest Part of their Lives in observing the celestial
Bodies , which they do by the Assistance of Glasses far excelling ours
in Goodness . SWIFT-1726-2,2,42.302

For this Advantage hath enabled them to extend the Discoveries much
farther than our Astronomers in <font> Europe <$$font> ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,42.303

for they have made a Catalogue of ten_thousand fixed Stars ; whereas the
largest of ours do not contain above one third Part of that Number .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,42.304

They have likewise discovered two lesser Stars , or <P_2,43> <font>
Satellites <$$font> , which revolve about <font> Mars <$$font> , whereof
the innermost is distant from the Center of the primary Planet exactly
three of his Diameters , and the outermost five ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,43.305

the former revolves in the Space of ten Hours , and the latter in twenty
one and an half ; so that the Squares of their periodical Times are very
near in the same Proportion with the Cubes of their Distance from the
Center of <font> Mars <$$font> , which evidently shews them to be
governed by the same Law of Gravitation , that influences the other
Heavenly Bodies . SWIFT-1726-2,2,43.306

They have observed ninety_three different Comets , and settled their
Periods with great Exactness . SWIFT-1726-2,2,43.307

If this be true , <paren> and they affirm it with great Confidence ,
<$$paren> it is much to be wished that their Observations were made
publick , whereby the Theory of Comets , which at present is very lame
and defective , might be brought to the same <P_2,44> Perfection with
other Parts of Astronomy . SWIFT-1726-2,2,44.308

The King would be the most absolute Prince in the Universe , if he could
but prevail on a Ministry to join with him ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,44.309

but these having their Estates below on the Continent , and considering
that the Office of a Favourite hath a very uncertain Tenure , would
never consent to the enslaving their Country . SWIFT-1726-2,2,44.310

If any Town should engage in Rebellion or Mutiny , fall into violent
Factions , or refuse to pay the usual Tribute , the King hath two
Methods of reducing them to Obedience . SWIFT-1726-2,2,44.311

The first and the mildest Course is by keeping the Island hovering over
such a Town , and the Lands about it , whereby he can deprive them of
the Benefit of the Sun and the Rain , and consequently afflict the
Inhabitants with Death and Diseases . SWIFT-1726-2,2,44.312

And if the Crime deserve it , they are at the same Time pelted from
above <P_2,45> with great Stones , against which they have no Defence
but by creeping into Cellars or Caves , while the Roofs of their Houses
are beaten to Pieces . SWIFT-1726-2,2,45.313

But if they still continue obstinate , or offer to raise Insurrections ,
he proceeds to the last Remedy , by letting the Island drop directly
upon their Heads , which makes a universal Destruction both of Houses
and Men . SWIFT-1726-2,2,45.314

However , this is an Extremity to which the Prince is seldom driven ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,45.315

neither indeed is he willing to put it in Execution ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,45.316

nor dare his Ministers advise him to an Action , which , as it would
render them odious to the People , so it would be a great Damage to
their own Estates , which lie all below , SWIFT-1726-2,2,45.317

for the Island is the King's Demesn . SWIFT-1726-2,2,45.318

But there is still indeed a more weighty Reason , why the Kings of this
Country have been always averse from executing so terrible an Action ,
unless upon the utmost Necessity . SWIFT-1726-2,2,45.319

For if the Town intended to be destroyed should <P_2,46> have in it any
tall Rocks , as it generally falls out in the larger Cities , a
Situation probably chosen at first with a View to prevent such a
Catastrophe ; or if it abound in high Spires or Pillars of Stone , a
sudden Fall might endanger the Bottom or Under-surface of the Island ,
which , although it consists , as I have said , of one entire Adamant
two_hundred Yards thick , might happen to crack by too great a Choque ,
or burst by approaching too near the Fires from the Houses below , as
the Backs both of Iron and Stone will often do in our Chimneys .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,46.320

Of all this the People are well apprized , SWIFT-1726-2,2,46.321

and understand how far to carry their Obstinacy , where their Liberty or
Property is concerned . SWIFT-1726-2,2,46.322

And the King , when he is highest provoked , and most determined to
press a City to Rubbish , orders the Island to descend with great
Gentleness , out of a Pretence of Tenderness to his People , but indeed
for fear of breaking the Adamantine Bottom ; in which Case , it is the
Opinion of all their <P_2,47> Philosophers , that the Load-stone could

His Conversation with that Lord . <$$font> SWIFT-1726-2,2,48.333

<$$heading>

Although I can@ @not say that I was ill-treated in this Island , yet I
must confess I thought my self too much neglected , not without some
Degree of Contempt . SWIFT-1726-2,2,48.335

For neither Prince nor People appeared to be curious in any Part of
Knowledge , except Mathematicks and Musick , wherein I was far their
Inferior , and upon that Account very little regarded .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,48.336

<P_2,49>

On the other Side , after having seen all the Curiosities of the Island
, I was very desirous to leave it , being heartily weary of those People
. SWIFT-1726-2,2,49.338

They were indeed excellent for two Sciences for which I have great
Esteem , and wherein I am not unversed ; but at the same Time , so
abstracted and involved in Speculation , that I never met with such
disagreeable Companions . SWIFT-1726-2,2,49.339

I convers'd only with Women , Tradesmen , <font> Flappers <$$font> , and
Court-Pages , during two Months of my Abode here , by which , at last ,
I render'd my self extremely contemptible ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,49.340

yet these were the only People from whom I could ever receive a
reasonable Answer . SWIFT-1726-2,2,49.341

I had obtained , by hard Study , a good Degree of Knowledge in their
Language ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,49.342

I was weary of being confined to an Island where I received so little
Countenance , SWIFT-1726-2,2,49.343

and resolved to leave it with the first Opportunity .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,49.344

There was a great Lord at Court , nearly related to the King , and for
that <P_2,50> Reason alone used with Respect . SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.345

He was universally reckoned the most ignorant and stupid Person among
them . SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.346

He had performed many eminent Services for the Crown ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.347

had great natural and acquired Parts , adorned with Integrity and Honour
, but so ill an Ear for Musick , that his Detractors reported he had
been often known to beat Time in the wrong Place ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.348

neither could his Tutors , without extreme Difficulty , teach him to
demonstrate the most easy Proposition in the Mathematicks .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.349

He was pleased to shew me many Marks of Favour , SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.350

often did me the Honour of a Visit , SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.351

desired to be informed in the Affairs of <font> Europe <$$font> , the
Laws and Customs , the Manners and Learning , of the several Countries
where I had travelled . SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.352

He listened {TEXT:listned} to me with great Attention ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.353

and made very wise Observations on all I spoke . SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.354

He had two <font> Flappers <$$font> attending him for State ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.355

but never made use of them except at Court , and in Visits of Ceremony ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,50.356

and would always command <P_2,51> them to withdraw when we were alone
together . SWIFT-1726-2,2,51.357

I intreated this illustrious Person to intercede in my Behalf with his
Majesty for Leave to depart , which he accordingly did , as he was
pleased to tell me , with Regret : SWIFT-1726-2,2,51.358

For , indeed he had made me several Offers very advantageous , which
however I refused with Expressions of the highest Acknowledgment .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,51.359

On the 16th Day of <font> February <$$font> I took Leave of his Majesty
and the Court . SWIFT-1726-2,2,51.360

The King made me a Present to the Value of about two_hundred Pounds
<font> English <$$font> , and my Protector his Kinsman as much more ,
together with a Letter of Recommendation to a Friend of his in <font>
Lagado <$$font> , the Metropolis : SWIFT-1726-2,2,51.361

The Island being then hovering over a Mountain about two Miles from it ,
I was let down from the lowest Gallery , in the same manner as I had
been taken up . SWIFT-1726-2,2,51.362

<P_2,52>

The Continent , as far as it is subject to the Monarch of the <font>
Flying Island <$$font> , passes under the general Name of <font>
Balnibarbi <$$font> , SWIFT-1726-2,2,52.364

and the Metropolis , as I said before , is called <font> Lagado .
<$$font> SWIFT-1726-2,2,52.365

I felt some little Satisfaction in finding my self on firm Ground .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,52.366

I walked to the City without any Concern , being clad like one of the
Natives , and sufficiently instructed to converse with them .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,52.367

I soon found out the Person's House to whom I was recommended ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,52.368

presented my Letter from his Friend the Grandee in the Island ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,52.369

and was received with much Kindness . SWIFT-1726-2,2,52.370

This great Lord , whose Name was <font> Munodi <$$font> , ordered me an
Apartment in his own House , where I continued during my Stay , and was
entertained in a most hospitable Manner . SWIFT-1726-2,2,52.371

The next Morning after my Arrival , he took me in his Chariot to see the
Town , which is about half the Bigness of <font> London <$$font> , but
the Houses very strangely built , and most of them out of Repair .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,52.372

<P_2,53>

The People in the Streets walked fast , SWIFT-1726-2,2,53.374

looked wild , their Eyes fixed , SWIFT-1726-2,2,53.375

and were generally in Rags . SWIFT-1726-2,2,53.376

We passed through one of the Town-Gates , SWIFT-1726-2,2,53.377

and went about three Miles into the Country , where I saw many Labourers
working with several sorts of Tools in the Ground , but was not able to
conjecture what they were about ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,53.378

neither did I observe any Expectation either of Corn or Grass , although
the Soil appeared to be excellent . SWIFT-1726-2,2,53.379

I could not forbear admiring at these odd Appearances both in Town and
Country , SWIFT-1726-2,2,53.380

and I made bold to desire my Conductor , that he would be pleased to
explain to me what could be meant by so many busy Heads , Hands , and
Faces , both in the Streets and the Fields , because I did not discover
any good Effects they produced ; but on the contrary , I never knew a
Soil so unhappily cultivated , Houses so ill contrived , and so ruinous
, or a People whose Countenances and Habit expressed so much Misery and
Want . SWIFT-1726-2,2,53.381

<P_2,54>

This Lord <font> Munodi <$$font> was a Person of the first Rank ,
SWIFT-1726-2,2,54.383

and had been some Years Governor of <font> Lagado <$$font> ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,54.384

but by a Cabal of Ministers was discharged for Insufficiency .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,54.385

However , the King treated him with Tenderness , as a well-meaning Man ,
but of a low contemptible Understanding . SWIFT-1726-2,2,54.386

When I gave that free Censure of the Country , and its Inhabitants , he
made no further Answer than by telling me , that I had not been long
enough among them to form a Judgment ; and that the different Nations of
the World had different Customs , with other common Topicks to the same
Purpose . SWIFT-1726-2,2,54.387

But when we returned to his Palace , he asked me how I liked the
Building , what Absurdities I observed , and what Quarrel I had with the
Dress and Looks of his Domesticks . SWIFT-1726-2,2,54.388

This he might safely do , because every Thing about him was magnificent
, regular , and polite . SWIFT-1726-2,2,54.389

I answered , <P_2,55> that his Excellency's Prudence , Quality , and
Fortune , had exempted him from those Defects which Folly and Beggary
had produced in others . SWIFT-1726-2,2,55.390

He said , if I would go with him to his Country House about twenty Miles
distant , where his Estate lay , there would be more Leisure for this
kind of Conversation . SWIFT-1726-2,2,55.391

I told his Excellency that I was entirely at his Disposal ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,55.392

and accordingly we set out next Morning . SWIFT-1726-2,2,55.393

During our Journey , he made me observe the several Methods used by
Farmers in managing their Lands , which to me were wholly unaccountable
; SWIFT-1726-2,2,55.394

for , except in some very few Places , I could not discover one Ear of
Corn or Blade of Grass . SWIFT-1726-2,2,55.395

But , in three Hours travelling , the Scene was wholly altered ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,55.396

we came into a most beautiful Country ; Farmers Houses at small
Distances , neatly built ; the Fields enclosed , containing Vineyards ,
Corn-grounds and Meadows . SWIFT-1726-2,2,55.397

Neither do I remember to have seen a <P_2,56> more delightful Prospect .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,56.398

His Excellency observed my Countenance to clear up ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,56.399

he told me , with a Sigh , that there his Estate began , and would
continue the same till we should come to his House ; that his Countrymen
ridicul'd and despis'd him for managing his Affairs no better , and for
setting so ill an Example to the Kingdom , which however was followed by
very few , such as were old , and wilful , and weak , like himself .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,56.400

We came at length to the House ; which was indeed a noble Structure ,
built according to the best Rules of Ancient Architecture .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,56.401

The Fountains , Gardens , Walks , Avenues , and Groves , were all
disposed with exact Judgment and Taste . SWIFT-1726-2,2,56.402

I gave due Praises to every Thing I saw ; whereof his Excellency took
not the least Notice till after Supper , when , there being no third
Companion , he told me , with a very melancholy Air , that he doubted he
must throw down his Houses in Town and <P_2,57> Country , to rebuild
them after the present Mode , destroy all his Plantations , and cast
others in such a Form as modern Usage required , and give the same
Directions to all his Tenants , unless he would submit to incur the
Censure of Pride , Singularity , Affectation , Ignorance , Caprice , and
perhaps increase his Majesty's Displeasure . That the Admiration I
appeared to be under , would cease or diminish , when he had informed me
of some Particulars which , probably , I never heard of at Court , the
People there being too much taken up in their own Speculations , to have
Regard to what passed here below . SWIFT-1726-2,2,57.403

The Sum of his Discourse was to this Effect . That about forty Years
ago , certain Persons went up to <font> Laputa <$$font> , either upon
Business or Diversion , and after five Months Continuance , came back
with a very little Smattering in Mathematicks , <P_2,58> but full of
Volatile Spirits acquired in that airy Region . That these Persons upon
their Return began to dislike the Management of every Thing below , and
fell into Schemes of putting all Arts , Sciences , Languages , and
Mechanicks upon a new Foot . SWIFT-1726-2,2,58.404

To this End , they procured a Royal Patent for erecting an Academy of
Projectors in <font> Lagado <$$font> ; SWIFT-1726-2,2,58.405

and the Humour prevailed so strongly among the People , that there is
not a Town of any Consequence in the Kingdom without such an Academy .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,58.406

In these Colleges , the Professors contrive new Rules and Methods of
Agriculture and Building , and new Instruments and Tools for all Trades
and Manufactures , whereby , as they undertake , one Man shall do the
Work of ten ; a Palace may be built in a Week , of Materials so durable
as to last for ever , without repairing ; all the Fruits of the Earth
shall come to Maturity at whatever Season we think fit to chuse , and
increase an_hundred_Fold more than <P_2,59> they do at present , with
innumerable other happy Proposals . SWIFT-1726-2,2,59.407

The only Inconvenience is , that none of these Projects are yet brought
to Perfection , SWIFT-1726-2,2,59.408

and in the mean time the whole Country lies miserably waste , the Houses
in Ruins , and the People without Food or Clothes . By all which ,
instead of being discouraged , they are fifty times more violently bent
upon prosecuting their Schemes , driven equally on by Hope and Despair :
SWIFT-1726-2,2,59.409

That as for himself , being not of an enterprizing Spirit , he was
content to go on in the old Forms , to live in the Houses his Ancestors
had built , and act as they did in every Part of Life without Innovation
: That , some few other Persons of Quality and Gentry had done the same
, but were looked on with an Eye of Contempt and ill Will , as Enemies
to Art , ignorant and ill Commonwealthsmen , preferring their own Ease
and Sloth before the general Improvement of their Country .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,59.410

<P_2,60>

His Lordship added , that he would not by any further Particulars
prevent the Pleasure I should certainly take in viewing the Grand
Academy , whither he was resolved I should go . SWIFT-1726-2,2,60.412

He only desired me to observe a ruined Building upon the Side of a
Mountain about three Miles distant , of which he gave me this Account :
That he had a very convenient Mill within half a Mile of his House ,
turned by a Current from a large River , and sufficient for his own
Family , as well as a great Number of his Tenants : That , about seven
Years ago , a Club of those Projectors came to him with Proposals to
destroy this Mill , and build another on the Side of that Mountain , on
the long Ridge whereof a long Canal must be cut for a Repository of
Water , to be conveyed up by Pipes and Engines to supply the Mill :
Because the Wind and Air upon a Height agitated the Water , and thereby
made it fitter for Motion : And because the Water descending down a
Declivity , would turn the Mill with half the Current <P_2,61> of a
River whose Course is more upon a Level . SWIFT-1726-2,2,61.413

He said , that being then not very well with the Court , and pressed by
many of his Friends , he complied with the Proposal ; and , after
employing an_hundred Men for two Years , the Work miscarried , the
Projectors went off , laying the Blame entirely upon him , railing at
him ever since , and putting others upon the same Experiment , with
equal assurance of Success , as well as equal Disappointment .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,61.414

In a few Days we came back to Town , SWIFT-1726-2,2,61.415

and his Excellency , considering the bad Character he had in the Academy
, would not go with me himself , SWIFT-1726-2,2,61.416

but recommended me to a Friend of his to bear me Company thither .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,61.417

My Lord was pleased to represent me as a great Admirer of Projects , and
a Person of much Curiosity and easy Belief ; which , indeed , was not
without Truth , SWIFT-1726-2,2,61.418

for I had my self been a sort of a Projector in my younger Days .

Chap. V . SWIFT-1726-2,2,62.422

<font> The Author permitted to see the Grand Academy of <$$font> Lagado
. SWIFT-1726-2,2,62.423

<font> The Academy largely described . SWIFT-1726-2,2,62.424

The Arts wherein the Professors employ themselves . <$$font>
SWIFT-1726-2,2,62.425

<$$heading>

This Academy is not an entire single Building , but a Continuation of
several Houses on both Sides of a Street , which growing waste was
purchased and applied to that Use . SWIFT-1726-2,2,62.427

I was received very kindly by the Warden , SWIFT-1726-2,2,62.428

and went for many Days to the Academy . SWIFT-1726-2,2,62.429

Every Room hath in it one or more Projectors , SWIFT-1726-2,2,62.430

and I believe I could not be in fewer than five_hundred Rooms .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,62.431

<P_2,63>

The first Man I saw was of a meager Aspect , with sooty Hands and Face ,
his Hair and Beard long , ragged and singed in several Places :
SWIFT-1726-2,2,63.433

His Clothes , Shirt , and Skin , were all of the same Colour .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,63.434

He had been eight Years upon a Project for extracting Sun-Beams out of
Cucumbers , which were to be put into Vials hermetically sealed , and
let out to warm the Air in raw inclement Summers .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,63.435

He told me , he did not doubt in eight Years more , he should be able to
supply the Governor's Gardens with Sun-shine at a reasonable Rate ;
SWIFT-1726-2,2,63.436

but he complained that his Stock was low , SWIFT-1726-2,2,63.437

and entreated me to give him something as an Encouragement to Ingenuity
, especially since this had been a very dear Season for Cucumbers .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,63.438

I made him a small Present , SWIFT-1726-2,2,63.439

for my Lord had furnished me with Money on purpose , because he knew
their Practice of begging from all who go to see them .
SWIFT-1726-2,2,63.440
