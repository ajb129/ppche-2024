VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,60.5

Dearest Uncle , - {ED:...} There are some important points regarding
Coburg , which I think have been overlooked .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,60.6

1. Affie by the <font> Coburg Hausgesetz <$$font> is not
{COM:previous_word_emphasized_in_original} <font> Regierungsf√§hig
<$$font> , or of age , till 21 , VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,60.7

and he is now <font> 18_and_1$$2 <$$font>
{COM:font_change_excludes_fraction} .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,60.8

2. By the same <font> Hausgesetz <$$font> it is particularly laid down
that <font> no <$$font> Duke of <font> Coburg <$$font> is ever to be
Sovereign of <font> another <$$font> country at the same time , <font>
except <$$font> in the case of there being <font> no <$$font> other heir
. VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,60.9

<P_1,61>

This was particularly agreed on {TEXT:in} , <font> in order <$$font> to
<font> avoid <$$font> the similarity <$$font> with <font> Hanover .
<$$font> VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,61.11

I remember all the discussions , VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,61.12

and my beloved Angel <font> particularly <$$font> approved <font> that
Article . <$$font> VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,61.13

This would therefore preclude Ernest from retaining the Duchies ;
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,61.14

Ernest must know this . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,61.15

But supposing this difficulty to be got over , I could never consent to
Affie's being Regent unless he were <font> quite independent of Ernest
<$$font> , and could thoroughly amend all the sad misgovernment which
has gone on for so long , and which has made Ernest unfortunately very
unpopular ; for much of which he is <font> not <$$font> to blame .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,61.16

Affie is <font> too <$$font> young and above <font> all <$$font> too
inexperienced to <font> start <$$font> without first preparing himself
for the position ; VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,61.17

and , if he were <font> Duke <$$font> , a Regency would be established
for him , during which time he would prepare himself for the duties
which would devolve upon him when he is of age .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,61.18

I do@ @n't think the <font> Greeks <$$font> <paren> who are very touchy
and fanciful <$$paren> would like to have a King who retained another
Sovereignty . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,61.19

Dearest Uncle , - {ED:...} I wish to ask your opinion upon the following
point before giving a final answer .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,64.38

<P_1,65>

There is <paren> as we well know <$$paren> always a great bother about
the rank of <font> Ambassadors <$$font> ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.40

and as I have <font> now <$$font> got <font> one <$$font> at Berlin ,
where so many Princes go , Lord Russell was anxious to define it ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.41

and I suggested after {COM:previous_word_emphasized_in_original} <font>
Reigning Dukes <$$font> , and the sons , brothers , and grandsons of
<font> Sovereigns <$$font> . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.42

Now , Lord Russell wanted to make an alternation and restrict it to
before {COM:previous_word_emphasized_in_original} Reigning Dukes , and
saying <font> merely <$$font> Grand Dukes , excepting <font> where
<$$font> the Reigning Duke was a <font> near <$$font> relation of the
Ambassador's <font> own <$$font> Sovereign .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.43

What is <font> your <$$font> opinion ?
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.44

Would not a Reigning Duke go before the <font> Son <$$font> <paren> not
the Crown Prince or Princess Royal <$$paren> of a Sovereign ?
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.45

Pray give me , as soon as you can , your opinion .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.46

You say that work does me good ; VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.47

but the contrary is the fact <font> with me <$$font> , as I have to do
it alone , VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.48

and my Doctors are constantly urging upon me <font> rest . <$$font>
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.49

My work and my worries are so totally different to any one else@ @'s :
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.50

ordinary mechanical work may be good for people in great distress , but
not <font> constant <$$font> anxiety , responsibility , and
interruptions of every kind , where at every <font> turn <$$font> the
heart is crushed and the wound is probed !
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.51

I feel too visibly how much less able for work I am than I was .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.52

I was very unwell from agitation and overwork yesterday , added to my
dreadful unbounded grief . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,65.53

Oh ! for an hour only with my darling !

VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.63

Beloved Uncle , - I have to thank you for a dear , affectionate letter
of the 20th . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.64

I am thankful to say our dear invalid at Malta goes on favourably ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.65

and they hope to land him to-day .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.66

But it <font> is just <$$font> the same fever <paren> typhoid <$$paren>
which took our Angel from us , VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.67

and you may imagine my - indeed <font> our - anguish . <$$font>
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.68

I live <font> all <$$font> thro' again , and with such strangely <font>
mixed feelings . <$$font> VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.69

I feel , while I pray so ardently that God may spare our darling boy ,
so like his beloved father , so clever and talented , and so excessively
amiable , <font> I <$$font> ca@ @n't imagine <font> how <$$font> anyone
<font> can <$$font> recover from this dire fever if <font> he did@ @n't
<$$font> , VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.70

and if dear Affie <paren> as , <font> unberufen <$$font> , we may
confidently trust he will <$$paren> <font> should <$$font> recover , I
think my <font> own <$$font> darling must return too !
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.71

Oh ! <font> how <$$font> troubles and anxieties persecute us , since
that dreadful day when God took <font> all <$$font> from me !
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.72

Dear Affie has been charmed by having his Commission given to him ,
which preyed upon him as he had worked so hard for months and fell ill
the very day the examination was to have come on !
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.73

Till the latter part or end of this week , at the earliest , we can@
@not expect him to be considered <font> safe <$$font> ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.74

and this uncertainty is terribly trying .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.75

Vicky arrived safely yesterday , VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.76

and is looking really <font> very <$$font> pretty , so young and fresh
and slim . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,68.77

I can but look at her , thinking how pleased her precious <P_1,69> Papa
would have been , and <font> how <$$font> happy , how proud we might
have been to have our two married daughters and our little grandson with
us , and to have received this <font> lovely Bride <$$font> !
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,69.78

Now <font> all , all <$$font> is spoilt ;
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,69.79

a heavy black cloud overhangs <font> every thing now <$$font> ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,69.80

I hope you were pleased with your little great-grandnephew ?
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,69.82

He is a clever , dear , good little child , the great favourite of my
beloved Angel ! VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,69.83

The sight of <font> all <$$font> these is <font> very very <$$font>
trying to me . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,69.84

Greece is still <font> Kingless <$$font> !
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,69.85

But Poland alarms me much more , as France wants to draw us into a
dangerous move , the results of which may be <font> war on the Rhine .
<$$font> VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,69.86

I shall prevent this by <font> all <$$font> means in my power ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,69.87

We are much pleased with the marked improvement which we have already

and he seems really <font> very <$$font> happy .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,81.106

VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,81.107

Sorry as one would be for that , that <font> alone <$$font> would <font>
not <$$font> be a lasting misfortune ;

but if he ruins the position of his son and grandchildren , that would

I am sure that if my Angel were still <font> on earth <$$font> , he
never would have <font> gone <$$font> so far !
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,81.112

about everything and writes to me : " Affairs are in such a mess as
never was ; VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,82.113

VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,130.344

But I am also almost sure that the Protocol will <font> not <$$font> be

have recognised the Protocol .

My dear Bertie , - Safely arrived here two hours ago .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,150.376

All that has passed , these four last days , seems like a dream to me ;
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,150.377

could not , bring <P_1,151> back my Angel , and I am <font> ever , ever
<$$font> lonely , VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.378

VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.381

and it was a great mercy that she <font> has <$$font> been preserved ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.382

for there <font> was <$$font> great danger in such a premature and rapid
confinement ; VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.383

and how deep is the interest I take in the dear , pretty , little baby .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.384

May God bless him VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.385

and may he be , as Vicky and Alice both say , " a real grandson of
adored Papa " ! VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.386

I like to think I was of some use to you both , in many of the little
arrangements , and little hitches , which I hope now are all smoothed
down . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.387

I wish now to say a few words again about the <font> names , sponsors
<$$font> , and <font> christening <$$font> .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.388

I will begin with the last , that is to say , that though I should for
myself prefer its being at Windsor , which is now associated with so
much that is precious to me , I quite agree to its being best for the
people of London that they should <font> not <$$font> be deprived of the
honour and gratification of having <font> some event <$$font> in town ;
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.389

and by having it , as all our christenings but <font> two <$$font> were
, in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace , I think I shall be able
to be present , and hold the dear baby myself , D. V , which , trying
though it will be , <font> I wish to do <$$font> .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.390

Do@ @n't think of settling the time for it , till you have consulted the
doctors , Dr. Farre , Sir James , etc. ;
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.391

for with so small a child , who wo@ @n't be at its full size for six
weeks , the christening ought rather to be delayed ;
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.392

ours were generally nearly two months old ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.393

and I think you would find it would be safer for the baby , if that were
the case . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.394

As regards , the <font> names <$$font> , if others besides <font> Albert
Victor <$$font> are added <paren> which <font> I <$$font> do@ @n't the
least <font> object to <$$font> <$$paren> , you must take dear Uncle

You could not give King Christian's and the Landgrave's without also
giving Uncle Leopold's . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.396

I would advise reserving <font> Edward <$$font> for a second or third
son . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,151.397

<P_1,152>

Respecting the <font> sponsors <$$font> , the only ones besides your own

VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,152.402

and has written me such a kind letter , that she deserves it .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,152.404

ought not to be overlooked . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,152.405

meant regarding peace , VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,235.532

and I will quote Lord Clarendon's own words :
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,235.533

" Her Royal Highness has entirely mistaken the meaning of Lord Clarendon
, who considered that the <font> whole <$$font> of Schleswig was lost to
Denmark , from the moment that the Conference came to an end , and
hostilities recommenced ; VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,235.534

and his <font> wish <$$font> , rather than his <font> hope <$$font> ,
was , that Prussia might be induced not to push her conquests further ,
and to annihilate the Danish Monarchy .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,235.535

{ED:...}

The only wish in England <font> now <$$font> , is that Prussia may be
contented with the rights she has acquired by conquest , and not push
these rights so far as to blot out Denmark from the map of Europe , and
create a feeling <font> here <$$font> which it may be impossible to
control . " VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,235.537

<P_1,236>

This is <font> all <$$font> we are now anxious about .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,236.539

Let Prussia , who is master of the position , be magnanimous .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,236.540

She <font> can <$$font> be so now so easily ;
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,236.541

she has obtained <font> all <$$font> Germany wished , viz. the
severance of the duchies from Denmark and their release from a yoke
which had become so hateful to them .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,236.542

Let Prussia also show that she does not mean to keep them for herself ,
and I believe all will come right .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,236.543

The shameful attacks against her grieve every right-minded person ;
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,236.544

and they have brought on the equally intemperate abuse of England in the
German Press . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,236.545

But this will wear off , if once peace is made , and there is no attack
on Copenhagen , or anything of that kind .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,236.546

You and I have but one common object , which was beloved Papa's , viz.
the prospering of our two countries , and a good and friendly
understanding between them . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,236.547

Let us therefore spare no pains to try and bring this about ;
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,236.548

VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,274.720

Nothing but complete quiet and being out a great deal in the air does me
good . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,274.722

My beloved Uncle , - {ED:...} You will be grieved to hear that poor Lord
Palmerston is <font> very <$$font> ill .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,277.731

I had heard he was very much better , when this morning a telegram
arrived saying he was much worse and in extreme <P_1,278> danger .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,278.732

This sounds very bad , VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,278.733

but we have heard nothing more all day .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,278.734

I should at once call on Lord Russell to carry on the same Government ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,278.735

and do not think that I should be obliged to alter my departure , and
under any circumstances not , I should think , have to leave this except
three or four days sooner than I intended .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,278.736

I had intended leaving on the 31st ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,278.737

and <font> I hope <$$font> to be able to stay as long , as <font> I
dread <$$font> the return to Windsor so much .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,278.738

It is so desolate , so dreary , so devoid of that simple , wild freedom

VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,278.739

My lot is a hard one , VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,278.748

Beloved Uncle , - Your dear letters of the 16th and 17th crossed mine .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.761

You know now already long , of the death of poor Lord Palmerston , alias
Pilgerstein ! VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.762

It is very <font> striking <$$font> ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.763

and is another link with the past - the happy past - which is gone ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.764

and in many ways he is a great loss .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.765

He had many valuable qualities , though many bad ones ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.766

and we had , God knows ! terrible trouble with him about Foreign
affairs . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.767

Still , as Prime Minister he managed affairs at home well ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.768

and behaved to me well . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.769

But I <font> never <$$font> liked him ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.770

or could ever the least respect him ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.771

nor could I forget his conduct on certain occasions to my Angel .
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.772

and <font> personal <$$font> feelings influenced his political acts very

Still , he is a loss ! VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.775

I shall have troubles and worries ,
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.776

and to face them <font> alone <$$font> without my Angel is dreadful !
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.777

I feel no energy , no interest -
VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.778

<font> nothing <$$font> left - VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.779

no one to talk to . VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.780

I sometimes wish I could throw everything up and retire into private
life ; VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.781

it is all so <font> hateful <$$font> to me without the interest my Angel
gave to it ; VICTORIA-186X-PRIVATE-LETTERS-1,1,279.782
