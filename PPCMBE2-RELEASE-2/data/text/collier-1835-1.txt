Scene I . COLLIER-1835-1,5.6

- <font> A handsome Apartment in Lady Caroline Butler's Mansion ,
opening on to a spacious Lawn . COLLIER-1835-1,5.7

The Room hung round with Sporting Pictures , Guns , Whips , Pistols ,
Bows and Arrows , &c. COLLIER-1835-1,5.8

Elegant Furniture . COLLIER-1835-1,5.9

Looking_Glass , Sofa , Chairs and Table , and an Easel . <$$font>
COLLIER-1835-1,5.10

Captain Cleveland , <font> discovered , reclining on the Sofa , perusing
the Newspaper . <$$font> COLLIER-1835-1,5.11

<font> Cha. <$$font> This is what I call giving an old friend a hearty
welcome with a vengeance after a five years' absence COLLIER-1835-1,5.12

<bracket> <font> Looks at his Watch . <$$font> <$$bracket>
COLLIER-1835-1,5.13

As I live , it is past four o'clock : COLLIER-1835-1,5.14

and here have I been for the last seven hours , without seeing one of
the precious inmates of this mansion , except the servants .
COLLIER-1835-1,5.15

Lady Caroline , I am certain , must have received my uncle's letter ,
informing her that we should be here to breakfast . COLLIER-1835-1,5.16

I shall , I fear , have too much reason to believe all the reports I
have heard concerning her ladyship's {TEXT:ladyships} strange mode of
living . COLLIER-1835-1,5.17

<bracket> <font> Throws down the paper . <$$font> <$$bracket>
COLLIER-1835-1,5.18

I wonder how my uncle has contrived to pass the time since breakfast ;
COLLIER-1835-1,5.19

egad ! he was in a rare ill-humour at Caroline's want of politeness in
not being at home to receive us . COLLIER-1835-1,5.20

<font> Enter <$$font> Frank , COLLIER-1835-1,5.21

<font> does not observe his master . <$$font> COLLIER-1835-1,5.22

<font> Frank . <$$font> Well , I never came into such a rum house as
this ; COLLIER-1835-1,5.23

here have we been ever since nine this morning , without meeting a soul
to bid us welcome , COLLIER-1835-1,5.24

and if it had@ @n't been for the very genteel way in which I introduced
myself to the cook , hang me , if I think I should have had a mouthful
to eat . COLLIER-1835-1,5.25

The people are all crazed in this house , COLLIER-1835-1,5.26

that@ @'s certain . COLLIER-1835-1,5.27

<font> Cha. <$$font> You think so , do you ? COLLIER-1835-1,5.28

<font> Frank . <$$font> Beg pardon , sir , COLLIER-1835-1,5.29

did@ @n't observe you . COLLIER-1835-1,5.30

<font> Cha. <$$font> Well , Frank , has the fair owner of this mansion
returned yet ? COLLIER-1835-1,5.31

<font> Frank . <$$font> No , sir ; COLLIER-1835-1,5.32

and what@ @'s more , it@ @'s rather uncertain when she will .
COLLIER-1835-1,5.33

<P_6>

<font> Cha. <$$font> What do you mean ? COLLIER-1835-1,6.35

<font> Frank . <$$font> Why , sir , the people in the kitchen to whom I
have thought fit to introduce myself , say , that her ladyship set off
with the hounds this morning at day break . COLLIER-1835-1,6.36

<font> Cha. <$$font> What , gone hunting ? COLLIER-1835-1,6.37

<font> Frank . <$$font> Yes , sir , COLLIER-1835-1,6.38

and she@ @'ll stick to it as long as her horse has a leg to stand upon .
COLLIER-1835-1,6.39

<font> Cha. <$$font> Then I have not been misinformed with regard to
her character . COLLIER-1835-1,6.40

Has she much company with her ? COLLIER-1835-1,6.41

<font> Frank . <$$font> She does@ @n't hunt in couples , believe me ,
COLLIER-1835-1,6.42

for Betty the cook , says , " half the country are out with her . "
COLLIER-1835-1,6.43

<font> Cha. <$$font> And is she often in the <font> habit <$$font>
COLLIER-1835-1,6.44

- <font> Frank . <$$font> Lord , love you , sir ! COLLIER-1835-1,6.45

she is never out of it . COLLIER-1835-1,6.46

<font> Cha. <$$font> I mean in the habit of following the chase .
COLLIER-1835-1,6.47

<font> Frank . <$$font> Only as often as the hounds are out .
COLLIER-1835-1,6.48

<font> Cha. <$$font> What a singular woman ! COLLIER-1835-1,6.49

yet I have known her very different . COLLIER-1835-1,6.50

<bracket> <font> Sighs . <$$font> <$$bracket> COLLIER-1835-1,6.51

<font> Frank . <$$font> So I have heard you say . COLLIER-1835-1,6.52

And now all the reports are confirmed , COLLIER-1835-1,6.53

surely a reasonable gentleman , as you are , can never comply with your
uncle's commands to marry such a masculine <font> perverter <$$font> of
petticoats , with nothing but a pretty face to recommend her ?
COLLIER-1835-1,6.54

<font> Cha. <$$font> And which she takes care shall be seen too ,
COLLIER-1835-1,6.55

for she gallops all over the country to exhibit it .
COLLIER-1835-1,6.56

<font> Frank . <$$font> You@ @'ll excuse an old servant , sir ;
COLLIER-1835-1,6.57

but for my part I@ @'d as soon think of marrying old Nick's eldest
daughter , as such a she dragoon . COLLIER-1835-1,6.58

<font> Cha. <$$font> And after all she is not most to blame .
COLLIER-1835-1,6.59

Her father , the late Earl , was considered the greatest hunter in the
country ; COLLIER-1835-1,6.60

his delight was to inspire her with the same taste ; COLLIER-1835-1,6.61

she has profited by his instructions , COLLIER-1835-1,6.62

and if report speaks true , has imbibed a tone of forward familiarity ,
only to be acquired from the constant society of men .
COLLIER-1835-1,6.63

<font> Frank . <$$font> <paren> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$paren> I wish
we were fairly back in town again with all my heart .
COLLIER-1835-1,6.64

<font> Cha. <$$font> But with all her faults I am confident she
possesses sound judgment , true sensibility , and all the requisite
virtues to ensure happiness . COLLIER-1835-1,6.65

<font> Frank . <$$font> I declare , sir , you@ @'re as deep in love as
ever . COLLIER-1835-1,6.66

<font> Cha. <$$font> Five years' absence has wrought no change in me .
COLLIER-1835-1,6.67

Lady Caroline was then a different creature - a dear , delightful girl !
COLLIER-1835-1,6.68

<font> Frank . <$$font> Change , or no change , marry her you must ,
COLLIER-1835-1,6.69

or else your uncle who has set his heart on the match , will disinherit
you . COLLIER-1835-1,6.70

<P_7>

<font> Cha. <$$font> Well thought of . COLLIER-1835-1,7.72

Have you seen Sir George since breakfast ? COLLIER-1835-1,7.73

<font> Frank . <$$font> Indeed I have : COLLIER-1835-1,7.74

he@ @'s storming and rating everybody in the house , to know the meaning
of Lady Caroline's strange behaviour . COLLIER-1835-1,7.75

He@ @'s been all over the park , and half over the village poking his
nose into everybody's face enquiring for her ladyship .
COLLIER-1835-1,7.76

But I forgot to tell you , sir , that you will not have to remain long
without company . COLLIER-1835-1,7.77

<font> Cha. <$$font> Indeed ! COLLIER-1835-1,7.78

who is visible at last - a man , or a muslin ? COLLIER-1835-1,7.79

<font> Frank . <$$font> Why , Sir , from the cut of the concern , I
should say it was rather doubtful . COLLIER-1835-1,7.80

<font> Cha. <$$font> What@ @'s in the wind now ! COLLIER-1835-1,7.81

<font> Frank . <$$font> A mere butterfly , sir - as <font> small
<$$font> an <font> apology <$$font> for a <font> man <$$font> as I ever
saw in a pair of indispensables . COLLIER-1835-1,7.82

I heard one of the servants address <font> it <$$font> by the name of
the Honourable Mr. - Mr. Hector . COLLIER-1835-1,7.83

<font> Cha. <$$font> That@ @'s Lady Caroline's baby brother , a youth
who has been educated under the superintendance of an old maiden aunt .
COLLIER-1835-1,7.84

<font> Frank . <$$font> 'Pon my life , sir , we@ @'re got into a rare
comical family . COLLIER-1835-1,7.85

<font> Cha. <$$font> You@ @'re right for once ; COLLIER-1835-1,7.86

for if this young man has only profited by the lessons of his maiden
aunt , half as well as Lady Caroline has by those of her fox-hunting
father , their society must be most desirable . COLLIER-1835-1,7.87

<font> Frank . <$$font> Here the beauty comes , your honor .
COLLIER-1835-1,7.88

<font> Cha. <$$font> Was there ever seen such a timid ,
embarrassed_looking creature ? COLLIER-1835-1,7.89

he bears some resemblance to his sister . COLLIER-1835-1,7.90

But , stand aside , COLLIER-1835-1,7.91

I may need your assistance in a trifling scheme I have in view .
COLLIER-1835-1,7.92

<font> Enter <$$font> Honourable Hector Butler , COLLIER-1835-1,7.93

<font> bows to <$$font> Charles . COLLIER-1835-1,7.94

<font> Hec. <$$font> Really . I beg pardon , COLLIER-1835-1,7.95

hope I do@ @n't interrupt , COLLIER-1835-1,7.96

was not aware that company was here . COLLIER-1835-1,7.97

<bracket> <font> Goes to the Looking_Glass . <$$font> <$$bracket>
COLLIER-1835-1,7.98

Oh , dear , what a figure I cut ! COLLIER-1835-1,7.99

Hair quite disordered , COLLIER-1835-1,7.100

and dress disfigured with horrid vulgar mud . COLLIER-1835-1,7.101

If my dear aunt could but see me now , what would she say ?
COLLIER-1835-1,7.102

<font> Frank . <$$font> <paren> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$paren> Why

COLLIER-1835-1,7.105

<font> Hec. <$$font> Well , I declare , he knows me !
COLLIER-1835-1,7.107

<font> Cha. <$$font> The same . COLLIER-1835-1,8.113

<font> Hec. <$$font> How very strange . COLLIER-1835-1,8.114

Caroline looked in this morning to ask my aunt's permission to let me be
present at her wedding . COLLIER-1835-1,8.115

<font> Cha. <$$font> Does she appear pleased at the thought of being
married ? COLLIER-1835-1,8.116

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh , my patience ! COLLIER-1835-1,8.117

it is she that does . COLLIER-1835-1,8.118

She says , Captain Cleveland is such a nice man , rather sedate though ,
but that she will soon alter him for the better . COLLIER-1835-1,8.119

My sister is such a droll one - COLLIER-1835-1,8.120

<font> Frank . <$$font> <paren> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$paren>
There@ @'s nice brace , I think . COLLIER-1835-1,8.121

<font> Hec. <$$font> Lord bless you , it would do your heart good to
hear her talk of being married ; COLLIER-1835-1,8.122

she thinks nothing of it , COLLIER-1835-1,8.123

she quite puts me to the blush ! COLLIER-1835-1,8.124

<font> Frank . <$$font> <paren> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$paren>
Pretty dear , does she . COLLIER-1835-1,8.125

<font> Hec. <$$font> But I thought I should find Caroline here .
COLLIER-1835-1,8.126

Have you not seen her ? COLLIER-1835-1,8.127

<font> Cha. <$$font> 'T@ @is five years since I have been blessed with
one glance . COLLIER-1835-1,8.128

<font> Hec. <$$font> How very strange . COLLIER-1835-1,8.129

She was in the stables just now , giving directions about the firing of
an old hunter that stumbled with me . COLLIER-1835-1,8.130

<font> Cha. <$$font> Why , you must have trembled for your life when
mounted . COLLIER-1835-1,8.138

<font> Hec. <$$font> I believe I did too ; COLLIER-1835-1,8.139

so not knowing what to do with the confounded beast -

You tumbled off ! COLLIER-1835-1,8.142

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh , no ! COLLIER-1835-1,8.143

I caught hold of the mane , COLLIER-1835-1,8.144

and stuck to him in gallant style , when turning the corner of a lane ,
not five_hundred yards off , a d-d brute of a jackass set up such an
infernal yell ; COLLIER-1835-1,8.145

horse started of course , COLLIER-1835-1,8.146

and sent me head over heels into a ditch . COLLIER-1835-1,8.147

Confound all jack_asses , I say . COLLIER-1835-1,8.148

<font> Cha. <$$font> And so say I . COLLIER-1835-1,8.149

<font> Hec. <$$font> Thanks , COLLIER-1835-1,9.157

thanks ! COLLIER-1835-1,9.158

Only bruised a little . COLLIER-1835-1,9.159

But , really , I must to my toilette - COLLIER-1835-1,9.160

lucky I sent over another suit . COLLIER-1835-1,9.161

why , the fellow@ @'s little better than a great girl .
COLLIER-1835-1,9.174

Heaven help me ! COLLIER-1835-1,9.175

What pains some people take to make their children ridiculous .
COLLIER-1835-1,9.176

That young man , had his talents been properly cultivated , might have
proved an ornament to society , instead of a blot on it ;
COLLIER-1835-1,9.177

this comes of leaving young men to the guidance of old maiden aunts .
COLLIER-1835-1,9.178

Well , truly , as Frank says , I think I have got into a nice family ,
COLLIER-1835-1,9.179

and if the lady answers her description but half as well as her brother
does his , by my honour , but I shall have no easy game to play .
COLLIER-1835-1,9.180

However , I am resolved to try a <font> ruse <$$font> to convince the
lady of her folly ; COLLIER-1835-1,9.181

the idea is excellent , COLLIER-1835-1,9.182

and should it have the effect of curing my dear Caroline of her defects
, I shall be one of the happiest fellows alive . COLLIER-1835-1,9.183

But should I fail - pshaw ! COLLIER-1835-1,9.184

I@ @'ll not think of that , COLLIER-1835-1,9.185

I know the excellence of her heart ; COLLIER-1835-1,9.186

and though the lesson will be severe , I fear not for the result .
COLLIER-1835-1,9.187

'T@ @is for Caroline and happiness , COLLIER-1835-1,9.188

<font> Sir G. <$$font> Well , nephew , I must say that Lady Caroline

<font> Cha. <$$font> My wish is to comply with the agreement entered

morning favourable - COLLIER-1835-1,13.352

seldom witnessed a finer field for sportsmen . COLLIER-1835-1,13.353

tongue . COLLIER-1835-1,13.354

" Hark to Charmer ! " was the Cry - COLLIER-1835-1,13.355

" Charmer has it - COLLIER-1835-1,13.359

Soon unkennelled him again ; COLLIER-1835-1,13.365

COLLIER-1835-1,13.366

being closely pressed , altered his scheme , COLLIER-1835-1,13.367

and ran down wind into Maythorn Ford , which he crossed in gallant style

and away he went again at a killing pace ; COLLIER-1835-1,13.369
