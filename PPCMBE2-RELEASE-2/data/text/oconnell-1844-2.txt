Fifth Day . OCONNELL-1844-2,133.4

<$$heading>

The judges sat at ten o'clock precisely , at which hour the traversers
were in attendance . OCONNELL-1844-2,133.6

The jury having been called over , the evidence for the crown was
resumed . OCONNELL-1844-2,133.7

The first witness called was Mr. John Jackson , the Irish correspondent
of the <font> Morning Herald <$$font> , who having been sworn , was
examined by Mr. Brewster , Q. C. , and deposed as follows : -
OCONNELL-1844-2,133.8

I am connected with the press : with the London <font> Morning Herald ;
<$$font> OCONNELL-1844-2,133.9

I am the Irish correspondent of that paper , OCONNELL-1844-2,133.10

and was so in the course of last summer and last autumn {TEXT:autum} ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,133.11

I attended at the meetings of the Repeal Association ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,133.12

I was in the habit of transmitting regularly to London , by the post ,
reports of what took place at those meetings . OCONNELL-1844-2,133.13

Mr. Brewster - My lords , I wish to apprise you that it is not my
<P_134> intention to make this gentleman go over all the speeches which
the court has already heard . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.14

I will confine myself almost exclusively to asking him who took part
{TEXT:to_okpart} at the meetings . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.15

Mr. Fitzgibbon , Q. C. said they had no wish to get any notification
on the subject . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.16

Mr. Brewster said in that case he would make his announcement to the
court . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.17

He wished to apprise their lordships that he did not mean to make the
gentleman on the table go over all the speeches that had been already
read in evidence , but he would merely confine himself to an account of
which of the traversers took part in them . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.18

The examination of Mr. Jackson was then resumed .
OCONNELL-1844-2,134.19

Some documents were handed in to the witness by the Crown Solicitor .
OCONNELL-1844-2,134.20

Mr. Brewster - Just cast your eye over that , OCONNELL-1844-2,134.21

and see if these are your own original notes that you sent to London ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,134.22

Yes , they are . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.23

Is that your report of the meeting of the 30th of May ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,134.24

It is . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.25

I see page 3 {COM:number_in_text_hard_to_make_out} in the report .
OCONNELL-1844-2,134.26

I see that Mr O'Connell is there represented as having made a speech .
OCONNELL-1844-2,134.27

The report is as follows : - OCONNELL-1844-2,134.28

" Mr. O'Connell then proceeded to call the attention of the association
to an error into which a Dublin journal had fallen in reporting the
proceedings at Longford . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.29

He <paren> Mr. O'Connell <$$paren> was made to designate the army of
England a ruffian soldiery . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.30

He said no such thing . " OCONNELL-1844-2,134.31

He then went on say - OCONNELL-1844-2,134.32

Do@ @n't mind what follows , as your report there ceases to give what he
did say . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.33

Look to page 6 of your report . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.34

I believe you have not seen these reports since they came from London -
? OCONNELL-1844-2,134.35

Yes , I got them from Mr. Kemmis to initial them .
OCONNELL-1844-2,134.36

Mr. Jackson then proceeded to read his report of Mr. O'Connell's
observations respecting the members of the Irish bar , who had , about
that time , joined the Repeal Association . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.37

He was next directed to refer to his report of the meeting of the
association on the 6th of June . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.38

Chief_Justice - To what meeting are you now going to refer ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,134.39

Mr. Brewster - This gentleman's {TEXT:gentlemen's} evidence , my lord ,
is all applicable to the association meetings at the Corn Exchange , and
nothing else . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.40

Witness - I perceive from page 1 , that Mr. O'Connell was present at
the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.41

The member for Kilkenny , Mr. John O'Connell , Mr. Barrett of the
<font> Pilot <$$font> , and Mr. Steele , were also present .
OCONNELL-1844-2,134.42

The witness then read some extracts from Mr. O'Connell's speech ,
referring to Saxon cruelty in Ireland , OCONNELL-1844-2,134.43

and then continued to read as follows : - OCONNELL-1844-2,134.44

Mr. O'Connell then announced his intended meetings for the remainder of
the month . OCONNELL-1844-2,134.45

He was to be on June the 8th , at Kilkenny ; on the 11th , at Mallow ;
13th , at Murroe , Abington ; 15th , Ennis ; 18th , Athlone ; 21st ,
Enniskillen " - that is a mistake <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
<bracket> The meeting that should have been inserted , was probably
Ennistymon . <$$bracket> " On the 28th , at Galway , and on the 29th ,
at Dundalk . " OCONNELL-1844-2,134.46

This witness was continuing to read his report of what followed , when
Mr. Hatchell , Q. C. , said the meeting of which evidence was then
given , did not appear in the bill of particulars .
OCONNELL-1844-2,134.47

Mr. Brewster said it would be found that all the meetings of the
association were set forth in the bill of particulars .
OCONNELL-1844-2,134.48

<P_135>

Mr. Ford , the agent for Mr. O'Connell , said the meeting of the 6th
of June was not in the bill of particulars , so he supposed no such
meeting had been held . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.50

Mr. Brewster said Mr. Ford was not entitled to make any such remark .
OCONNELL-1844-2,135.51

If necessary he was prepared to show that they would be justified in
giving that meeting in evidence ; OCONNELL-1844-2,135.52

but he was willing that the jury should erase that meeting of the 6th of
June from their notes . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.53

Examination continued - OCONNELL-1844-2,135.54

I have my report of the meeting of the association held on the 4th of
July before me . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.55

I perceive from it that Mr. {TEXT:Mr,} Daniel O'Connell , Mr. John
O'Connell , Mr. Ray . the secretary , and Mr. {TEXT:Mr,} Steele were
present . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.56

Mr. Brewster - Does the report state anything about American money
being handed in ? OCONNELL-1844-2,135.57

Yes , it says there were sums of money handed in from America .
OCONNELL-1844-2,135.58

Go to the meeting of the 5th of July . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.59

I have it here . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.60

I see from page 1 that Mr. O'Connell , Mr. Duffy of the <font> Nation
<$$font> , and Mr. John O'Connell were there . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.61

Mr. O'Connell said " he wished to state that he had that morning
received a letter from Sligo enclosing a letter from a discharged
soldier stating that he was employed by Mr. O'Connell to drill the
people . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.62

That letter could not be then produced , because Mr. Ray , the
secretary was ill , and some of the clerks in the office had mislaid it
. " OCONNELL-1844-2,135.63

Mr. Brewster said he wanted that extract to show that Mr. O'Connell
described Mr. Ray as the secretary . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.64

The witness then continued to read his report of some observations made
by Mr. O'Connell at the same meeting , respecting Ribbonism and
Chartism in the north of Ireland ; and also a sentence stating that the
secretary {TEXT:ecretary} read the minutes of the last day's proceedings
. OCONNELL-1844-2,135.65

Mr. Brewster . - Who was it that acted as secretary on the occasion ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,135.66

Mr. Jackson - I can@ @not remember . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.67

The witness then read a motion by Mr. O'Connell that the American
letters should be entered on the American book of the association .
OCONNELL-1844-2,135.68

Look to the meeting of the 18th of July . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.69

Mr. O'Connell here suggested that the meetings proved by the witness
should be handed in and marked by the officer of the court .
OCONNELL-1844-2,135.70

The transcribed notes proved were then all initialed by the clerk of the
crown . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.71

At page 1 see if any of the traversers were present at that meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,135.72

Barrett , of the <font> Pilot ; <$$font> page 12 , Mr. Ray ; and page
14 , Dr Gray . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.73

The Chief_Justice having complained of there being great noise in the
court , Mr. Fitzgibbon suggested that those who had nothing to do with
the trial , and who could not avoid coughing , would go home and cook
themselves , and the court would be quiet enough - <paren> laughter .
<$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,135.74

Mr. Brewster - Do you find Mr. {TEXT:Mr:} O'Connell making a speech at
page 3 ? OCONNELL-1844-2,135.75

The witness replied in the affirmative , OCONNELL-1844-2,135.76

and proceeded to read a speech of Mr. O'Connell's , eulogising the
conduct of the Rev. Mr. Murtagh , and stating that he would attend a
meeting at Baltinglass on his birthday . OCONNELL-1844-2,135.77

who collected subscriptions to a certain amount .

Mr. Whiteside objected to this meeting being given in evidence , as
there was not any meeting dated the 14th of August , mentioned in the
indictment . OCONNELL-1844-2,136.95

Mr. Brewster read the charge with the date in question attached to it
from the indictment , OCONNELL-1844-2,136.96

but it was afterwards ascertained to be a mistake - upon which he
referred the witness to his notes of the 22d of August , and asked him
to read the names of the traversers who were present ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,136.97

At page 3 I find that Mr. O'Connell was there , and read letters from
different repeal wardens , enclosing subscriptions .

OCONNELL-1844-2,138.193

Mr. Duffy <P_139> handed in subscriptions from several places in the
north of Ireland ; OCONNELL-1844-2,139.194

Mr. O'Connell , Mr. John O'Connell , and Dr. Gray , attended the
meeting held on the 27th of September . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.195

Mr. Brewster - The speeches made on that occasion by Mr. O'Connell
were read by Mr. Ross yesterday . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.196

I will not trouble the court by hearing them read again .
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.197

Mr. Whiteside - This witness's note may not be the same as Mr. Ross's
. OCONNELL-1844-2,139.198

Mr. Brewster - I merely wish to prove who were present at the meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.199

<bracket> The witness in answer , proceeded to say . Mr. O'Connell ,
Mr. John O'Connell , and Mr. Ray , were present at the meeting on the
28th of September . <$$bracket> OCONNELL-1844-2,139.200

Did Mr. O'Connell state anything as to any other meeting to be held ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.201

He made some observations in reference {TEXT:refereace} to the conduct
of the meeting at Mullaghmast . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.202

Mr. Moore - If the object is to corroborate the testimony given by Mr.
Ross , I contend that Mr. Brewster should not read what he likes .
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.203

Mr. Brewster - I proposed to prove that the persons were at the
different meetings which he deposes . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.204

In some instances Mr. Ross was not present , OCONNELL-1844-2,139.205

in others he was present , OCONNELL-1844-2,139.206

and I thought it desirable to call upon him to read the speeches at
which he himself was present . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.207

I want him to tell me if Mr. O'Connell announced the meeting at
Mullaghmast . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.208

Mr. Moore contended that the learned counsel had no right to call upon
the witness to read those passages which he considered material .
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.209

The Chief_Justice said he thought Mr. Moore misunderstood the course
taken , that was not the course . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.210

Mr. Moore said he heard Mr. Brewster say he began in the middle of a
speech , OCONNELL-1844-2,139.211

Mr. Brewster said no ; it was in the middle {TEXT:mindle} of a page .
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.212

Mr. Whiteside said that Mr. O'Connell referred to the address of
thirty {TEXT:thiriy} Irish members , and if such a document were
observed upon by Mr. O'Connell , we have a right to have all read .
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.213

Chief_Justice - The witness was stopped in that ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.214

I do@ @n't consider any part of that read ; OCONNELL-1844-2,139.215

he was stopped in a part of evidence to which counsel did not intend to
call his attention ; OCONNELL-1844-2,139.216

but that does not preclude the counsel for the traversers from asking
the witness about the speech of Mr. {TEXT:Mr-} O'Connell :
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.217

and I would at once say it would be quite unfair for the crown to give a
garbled extract of {TEXT:ef} a speech , and not give the rest .
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.218

Mr. Brewster to witness - Were there any other traversers at the
meeting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,139.219

Mr. Steele was also at the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.220

I will now come to the meeting of the 3d of October .
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.221

Look at page 1 , OCONNELL-1844-2,139.222

and tell me do you find that any of the traversers were there .
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.223

Yes , Mr. O'Connell was there . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.224

Go to page 4 . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.225

Mr. Steele was there . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.226

Go to page 5 . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.227

Mr. Duffy , of the <font> Nation <$$font> , was there .
OCONNELL-1844-2,139.228

Go to page 6 . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.229

Mr Ray and Mr. John O'Connell were there . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.230

Go to page 7 . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.231

Dr. Gray was there . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.232

Go to page 14 . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.233

The Rev. Mr. Tierney , of Clontobret . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.234

Mr. Brewster said that Mr. Hughes read the whole of the proceedings at
the meeting from his short-hand notes , and he would not ask the witness
any more in reference to it . OCONNELL-1844-2,139.235

<P_140>

Mr. Fitzgibbon - I object to Mr. Brewster telling his reasons for not
examining the witness in reference to that meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,140.237

Chief_Justice - I beg pardon , OCONNELL-1844-2,140.238

the court have a right to be informed upon the subject for their own
satisfaction . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.239

Mr. Fitzgibbon - Having in his own mind determined not to ask the
witness any more questions , Mr. Brewster has no right to state his
reasons for coming to that determination . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.240

Mr. Moore - I object to the inference being raised , that if the crown
liked they could call upon the witness to frustrate the evidence of Mr.
Hughes . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.241

Mr. Brewster <paren> to witness <$$paren> - At the several meetings ,
in reference to which you have given evidence , did many persons attend
? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.242

Sometimes more , sometimes less <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,140.243

Were they generally well attended or not ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.244

Generally well attended . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.245

Now , at any of the meetings of which I have been asking you , are you
able to recollect whether you heard any of the traversers , Mr.
O'Connell , Mr. John O'Connell . or Dr. Gray , say anything about
newspapers ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.246

Mr. Fitzgibbon - Is that a legal question ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.247

Judge Perrin - To what occasion do you refer ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.248

Mr. Brewster - To any of the meetings to which he deposed .
OCONNELL-1844-2,140.249

Mr. Fitzgibbon - I pray your lordships' attention to the generality of
the question . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.250

Judge Perrin - He must fix the time , OCONNELL-1844-2,140.251

or the witness can@ @not give evidence . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.252

Mr. {TEXT:Mr,} Brewster - I want to avoid leading the witness .
OCONNELL-1844-2,140.253

Did you <paren> to witness <$$paren> hear anything said about newspapers
? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.254

Nothing . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.255

My lords , I am done . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.256

<heading>

Cross-examined by Mr. Fitzgibbon , Q. C. OCONNELL-1844-2,140.258

<$$heading>

May I ask you what countryman you are ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.260

I am a Clare man . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.261

You are an Irishman , at all events ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.262

I am . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.263

How long have you been a reporter ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.264

I have been acting as a correspondent for the last two years .
OCONNELL-1844-2,140.265

I did not ask you how long you had been a correspondent ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,140.266

what I asked you was , how long had you been a reporter ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,140.267

I can@ @not say I am a reporter . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.268

Does that mean that you are not a reporter ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.269

I am not a short-hand writer . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.270

I did not ask you that ; OCONNELL-1844-2,140.271

do you mean to say you are not , and never were a reporter ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,140.272

Not in the sense you understand the word . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.273

What sense ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.274

The term is applied to a short-hand writer , OCONNELL-1844-2,140.275

and I am not one . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.276

Do you mean by a reporter a short-hand writer , or a writer of
stenography ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.277

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.278

Try OCONNELL-1844-2,140.279

and give me an answer {TEXT:answew} to a simple question .
OCONNELL-1844-2,140.280

Were you ever in the capacity of a person reporting proceedings in
courts of justice for the purpose of having those reports published ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,140.281

Yes , after a manner . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.282

Then you were a reporter of public proceedings which were intended for
publication in newpapers ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.283

Yes , I was . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.284

Now mind , that is what I mean by a reporter . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.285

When did you begin that occupation ? OCONNELL-1844-2,140.286

I suppose three or four weeks ago . OCONNELL-1844-2,140.287

<P_141>

For what purpose were you engaged ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.289

I was in the habit of contributing to provincial papers .
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.290

Now mind I do@ @n't mean by a reporter a contributor ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.291

What provincial papers were they ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.292

Papers in the country ; the <font> Limerick Star <$$font> and <font>
Limerick Chronicle <$$font> . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.293

What were the politics of the <font> Limerick Star <$$font> ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.294

Liberal . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.295

What were the politics of the other ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.296

Conservative . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.297

Did you send reports to both at the same time ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.298

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.299

From whence did you send them ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.300

I sent them from my own place . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.301

Of all this world will you tell me what place belongs to you ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.302

Kilrush . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.303

That is your place ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.304

My native place . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.305

And you reported some public proceedings of interest in that place ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.306

They had no reference to politics ; OCONNELL-1844-2,141.307

they were sketches of the petty sessions . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.308

Were they illustrated sketches ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.309

They were a little embellished occasionally . <paren> Laughter
<$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.310

By that you mean to say they had pictures connected with them ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.311

They were pen-and-ink sketches . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.312

Then the embellishment was done with pen-and-ink ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.313

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.314

By the embellishment I suppose I may say that something was put into
your report which had not in fact taken place ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.315

Decidedly ; OCONNELL-1844-2,141.316

something that was not true . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.317

Something absolutely false ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.318

Half of them were fiction <paren> laughter . <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.319

That is what you call reporting after a manner , <paren> laughter
<$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.320

Then you commenced your career as a reporter by vending falsehood ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.321

No ; I did it just upon the same principle of contributing to a magazine
. OCONNELL-1844-2,141.322

Then you contributed to a magazine ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.323

I have done so a little OCONNELL-1844-2,141.324

You embellished what you wrote in the same way ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.325

They were tales of imagination <paren> laughter . <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.326

Are you a <font> bit <$$font> of a poet ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.327

I am a very large one ; OCONNELL-1844-2,141.328

but I can@ @not call myself a poet . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.329

Maybe you are what they call in the west of Clare a poetaster ? <paren>
laughter . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,141.330

I can@ @not call myself a poet ; OCONNELL-1844-2,141.331

you may call me a poetaster if you choose . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.332

Then you have been contributing verse to papers ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.333

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.334

To what papers have you been in the habit of sending your poetry ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.335

To the papers in the country ; the <font> Star <$$font> and the <font>
Chronicle <$$font> . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.336

Your poetry , I presume , had some conformity with the principles of the
paper for which you wrote ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.337

None whatsoever . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.338

Were your reports which you sent to the newspapers similar to those
which you sent to the magazines ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.339

No ; <paren> as we understood witness . <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.340

For what magazines did you write ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.341

I wrote a sketch for the <font> University Magazine ; <$$font> a short
tale . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.342

Was it not intended to be a true one ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.343

Yes , for those who were fools enough to believe it ; <paren> a laugh .
<$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,141.344

Now , did you intend that the illustrated sketches which you sent from
Kilrush should pass for true ones ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.345

Some of them were true , some not . OCONNELL-1844-2,141.346

When did you cease reporting at Kilrush ? OCONNELL-1844-2,141.347

This month two years I came over to Dublin ; OCONNELL-1844-2,141.348

I got a letter from the proprietors of the <font> Morning Herald ,
<$$font> wishing me to come to Dublin to be their Irish correspondent .
OCONNELL-1844-2,141.349

<P_142>

Who introduced you to the proprietor of the <font> Herald <$$font> at
Kilrush ? OCONNELL-1844-2,142.351

I met Mr. Griffin ; OCONNELL-1844-2,142.352

he asked me if I were the author of sketches in his cousin's paper
<paren> the <font> Limerick Star <$$paren> , <$$font> as the proprietors
of the <font> Morning Herald <$$font> wished me to send some sketches to
them . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.353

I did so ; OCONNELL-1844-2,142.354

and subsequently came to Dublin to act in the capacity of their
correspondent . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.355

Dublin is a place where a man must have ' tin . '
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.356

How do you support yourself here ? OCONNELL-1844-2,142.357

I receive 150 guineas a year from the <font> Morning Herald . <$$font>
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.358

Let me ask you what do you do for that ? OCONNELL-1844-2,142.359

I send them anything which I have in reference to topics of the day ;
anything of public interest ; a summary from the Dublin papers .
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.360

You were daily to read the local papers of Dublin , and make a summary
of that part which you thought agreeable to the editor of the <font>
Morning Herald , <$$font> and transmit it to him ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.361

Yes ; I was to send anything of newspaper interest generally .
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.362

Had you the privilege of embellishing what you send him ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.363

I had . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.364

Did you exercise it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,142.365

Not in matters of truth . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.366

Some of what I sent was true ; others not . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.367

Was there any truth in what you sent ? OCONNELL-1844-2,142.368

I always sent what was true to the best of my ability ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.369

I did not always make an inquiry into the truth of what I sent ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.370

but I frequently did do so ; OCONNELL-1844-2,142.371

where the topic was the subject of conversation I endeavoured to find
out whether it was true or false . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.372

If I understood you rightly , the manuscript which I hold in my hand was
what you sent to the <font> Morning Herald ? <$$font>
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.373

That was a letter , one of which I send daily to the <font> Morning
Herald . <$$font> OCONNELL-1844-2,142.374

Mr. Brewster {TEXT:Brewester} here made some observations which the
reporters did not catch , whereupon , Mr. Fitzgibbon said , I beg of
you , Mr. Brewster {TEXT:Brewester} , not to assume that I do@ @n't
understand what he said . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.375

I am very nearly a Clare man myself , OCONNELL-1844-2,142.376

and can understand the Clare brogue right well .
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.377

<paren> To witness <$$paren> - Did you send those scraps of paper to the
<font> Morning Herald <$$font> ? OCONNELL-1844-2,142.378

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.379

I do@ @n't mean the substance of what these papers contain , but the
identical papers themselves . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.380

The very identical papers I hold in my hand , you sent to the <font>
Morning Herald <$$font> for the purpose of being printed ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.381

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.382

And I suppose you know enough of reporting to be aware that it is
necessary that the manuscript should be written upon one side only ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.383

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.384

That is a part of your instructions ? OCONNELL-1844-2,142.385

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.386

In order that the manuscript , without being copied , may be immediately
sent into a printing-office , to be set up ? OCONNELL-1844-2,142.387

Yes OCONNELL-1844-2,142.388

Were these papers which you sent to the <font> Herald <$$font> in the
same state as that in which they are at present ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.389

They were on the full length , and not divided , as some of the passages
are ; OCONNELL-1844-2,142.390

they were all of the same size ; OCONNELL-1844-2,142.391

those two pages were not divided by me . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.392

Then these two pages formed one originally ? OCONNELL-1844-2,142.393

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.394

You received these papers back from the <font> Morning Herald <$$font> ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.395

I did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.396

After you first sent these papers to the <font> Morning Herald <$$font>
, when did you see them again ? OCONNELL-1844-2,142.397

I saw them about two months ago ; scarce two months ago .
OCONNELL-1844-2,142.398

In whose hands did you see them ? OCONNELL-1844-2,142.399

In the Crown Solicitor's . OCONNELL-1844-2,142.400

<P_143>

Where did you see them ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.402

He sent for me , OCONNELL-1844-2,143.403

and when I went to him I saw them . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.404

Was that the first time you saw them after sending them ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.405

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.406

Whose initials are these ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.407

My own . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.408

Where and when did you write them ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.409

At the Crown Solicitor's office , two days after I first saw them ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.410

I did so by the direction of the proprietors . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.411

Had you any {TEXT:any_any} communication with Mr. Kemmis , the Crown
Solicitor , before ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.412

None whatever ; OCONNELL-1844-2,143.413

a letter was handed to me from the proprietors of the <font> Morning
Herald , <$$font> stating OCONNELL-1844-2,143.414

Do@ @n't mind what that letter stated . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.415

Did you expect the communication from Mr. Kemmis ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.416

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.417

When did you begin to attend the meetings of the association ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.418

About nine months ago . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.419

Are you a repealer ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.420

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.421

Did you pay a shilling to the association ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.422

I paid a shilling for admission the first day I went ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.423

I afterwards went in as a reporter . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.424

Were these pieces of paper written by you when you were reporting at the
association ; OCONNELL-1844-2,143.425

and were they your own reports taken at the time ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.426

Sometimes they were , OCONNELL-1844-2,143.427

and sometimes they were written from the slips of the man near me .
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.428

They were frequently not your own reports , not being able to take the
speeches ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.429

Frequently not , as I was not a short-hand writer .
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.430

You sometimes copied from the slips of a short-hand writer near you ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.431

Yes ; I sometimes copied what he had written out .
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.432

Was it while the proceedings were going on you copied from the slips of
the short-hand writer ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.433

Yes ; I gave the substance of it , endeavouring to vary it a little .
So that it might not appear to be a copy of his ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.434

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.435

You did that for the purpose of making your employers believe you had
taken it down yourself ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.436

Why , it is very customary ; OCONNELL-1844-2,143.437

I did it very often . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.438

And these are the notes you read here to-day ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.439

Some of them . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.440

Take up the notes you have read here to-day , OCONNELL-1844-2,143.441

and select out of them any one which you can positively swear was taken
down from the lips of the speaker at the time he spoke ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.442

Upon my oath Mr. O'Connell made the observations written in this slip ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.443

it is the substance of what he said ; OCONNELL-1844-2,143.444

I never undertake to give the exact words . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.445

On your oath did you write on that slip of paper , while he was speaking
? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.446

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.447

Is that taken from Mr. O'Connell's lips ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.448

To the best of my belief it is . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.449

Do you positively swear it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.450

To the best of my recollection I swear it . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.451

You will not positively swear it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.452

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.453

What is the date of that piece of paper ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.454

May 30 . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.455

Will you swear it was not taken from another paper ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,143.456

I can@ @not . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.457

Then it may or may not have been taken ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.458

I do not recollect whether it was taken from another paper , or from the
lips of the speaker . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.459

Can you fix on any one of these papers , which you can swear was written
on while the man was speaking ? OCONNELL-1844-2,143.460

I can@ @not . OCONNELL-1844-2,143.461

<P_144>

Take up the paper of the 5th July . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.463

Was that little bundle made up in the same way as the others ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.464

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.465

Was it written while you were at the association ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.466

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.467

While the people were there speaking ? OCONNELL-1844-2,144.468

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.469

Will you swear that the whole of that bundle was so written ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.470

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.471

Every bit of that bundle was written in the room ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.472

Yes ; everything that refers to the meeting of the association was
written in the room . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.473

Will you swear on your oath positively that every word on these slips
was written in the association room , from and while the speakers were
speaking ? OCONNELL-1844-2,144.474

Certainly not . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.475

Did you not swear awhile ago that they were written in the room while
the men were speaking ? OCONNELL-1844-2,144.476

Allow me to explain ; OCONNELL-1844-2,144.477

I frequently {TEXT:frequeutly} , while money was handed in , wrote out
what the last speaker had said . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.478

Then every word in these papers was written while the speakers were
speaking , or something else was doing ? OCONNELL-1844-2,144.479

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.480

Look to the paper , dated the 5th of July , OCONNELL-1844-2,144.481

and read the commencement of Mr O'Connell's speech .
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.482

Mr. Brewster objected to the newspaper being read , unless it were put
in in evidence . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.483

Mr. Fitzgibbon was not asking Mr. Brewster to look at what he was
doing <paren> laughter <$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.484

He was tessing {COM:sic} the credit of the witness ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.485

and for that purpose was repeating <font> verbatim et literatim <$$font>
what the witness had sent forward as his own report .
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.486

It mattered not by what human means he was able to do so .
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.487

Mr. Brewster said that was the question . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.488

He objected to Mr. {TEXT:Mr-} Fitzgibbon's reading a newspaper .
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.489

Mr. Fitzgibbon <paren> laying aside the newspaper and taking up his
brief . <$$paren> Well , then , it is my brief I have in my hand -
<paren> laughter . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,144.490

Mr. Brewster did not object because it was a newspaper from which Mr.
Fitzgibbon was reading - OCONNELL-1844-2,144.491

he required that whatever he read from should be given in evidence .
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.492

Mr. Fitzgibbon contended that he had a right to repeat what the witness
had written , in order to show them that that which purported to have
been taken from his own notes , was copied from a morning paper ,
published the day after the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.493

Mr. Justice Crampton - Am I to understand that you intend to give the
paper in evidence ? OCONNELL-1844-2,144.494

Mr. Fitzgibbon - No , my lord . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.495

Mr. Brewster said he would withdraw his opposition if Mr. Fitzgibbon
would put the document in evidence . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.496

It was necessary Mr. Fitzgibbon should be required to do so , as he
might be reading an exact transcript from the <font> Morning Herald
<$$font> itself . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.497

Mr. Fitzgibbon said he would waive the point , and attain his object by
putting a question to the witness . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.498

Now , on your oath , where did you copy the paper in your hands ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.499

To the best of my recollection I copied it from notes taken at the
meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,144.500

To the best of your recollection did you do that while Mr. O'Connell
was present , and speaking ? OCONNELL-1844-2,144.501

I can@ @not positively {TEXT:possitively} swear ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.502

it is possible I might have got it or seen it in the morning papers .
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.503

Will you swear you did not get it until next day ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,144.504

<P_145>

Judge Perrin - Of course that is what the witness means .
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.506

Witness - It is quite possible I copied the report from a note-taker by
me , OCONNELL-1844-2,145.507

but whenever I did adopt the report in the morning newspapers , I cut it
out OCONNELL-1844-2,145.508

and sent it to London in print , as I cut it out of the paper .
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.509

Judge Perrin intimated to the witness that if he gave a direct answer to
the questions put to him he would save himself a great deal of trouble ,
and the court a great deal of time . OCONNELL-1844-2,145.510

Mr. Fitzgibbon - Then that piece of paper now in {TEXT:iu} your hand ,
and which you sent as your report to the <font> Morning Herald ,
<$$font> might have been copied by you from any note-taker sitting near
you at the Corn-Exchange , OCONNELL-1844-2,145.511

or you might have copied it from the newspapers containing an account of
the proceedings next morning ? OCONNELL-1844-2,145.512

Witness - I can@ @not say which was the case in this instance .
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.513

A Juror - Did you not swear that you wrote all that during the time you
were in the Corn-Exchange ? OCONNELL-1844-2,145.514

Yes ; the majority of those papers were written during the meetings .
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.515

Mr. Fitzgibbon - That is not an answer to the question put to you .
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.516

Judge Crampton <paren> to the jury <$$paren> - You had better leave the
witness in the counsel's hands for the present .
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.517

Mr. Fitzgibbon - Now , will you answer the question that gentleman put
to you very properly ? OCONNELL-1844-2,145.518

To the best of my recollection the majority of these papers were written
during the meetings . OCONNELL-1844-2,145.519

Will you swear that they were all written during the meetings ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.520

The majority of them were , OCONNELL-1844-2,145.521

and some were written next day . OCONNELL-1844-2,145.522

Did you not say a while ago that they were all written during the
meetings ? OCONNELL-1844-2,145.523

I said , generally speaking , all of them were , OCONNELL-1844-2,145.524

but I could not swear positively that they were all written then ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.525

I do not remember saying to-day that they were all written by me during
the meetings ; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.526

I swear that positively ; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.527

I do@ @n't think I did swear that they were all written at the meetings
; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.528

I was not always writing memoranda of the proceedings while they were
going on ; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.529

sometimes I was only a listener , and not taking notes at all ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.530

I recollect Mr. O'Connell's making a very long speech upon the subject
of negro slavery ; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.531

I was present ; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.532

it was spoken on the 5th of July last ; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.533

to the best of my recollection I was present at the association on that
day , when Mr. O'Connell spoke at great length upon the slavery
question . OCONNELL-1844-2,145.534

Now , I beg that answer may be specially taken down .
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.535

<paren> To the witness <$$paren> - Were you present at the whole of the
meeting of the association on the 5th of July ? OCONNELL-1844-2,145.536

I was there that day certainly , OCONNELL-1844-2,145.537

but I can@ @not say whether I left before the proceedings were over ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.538

I will not swear positively that I was present there for an hour or for
half an hour . OCONNELL-1844-2,145.539

Generally speaking I remained for two or three hours ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.540

I was there for more than an hour that day ; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.541

I am sure of it ; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.542

I remember for a certainty that I was there for an hour that day ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.543

but I did not " time " myself , OCONNELL-1844-2,145.544

and I can@ @not therefore be certain ; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.545

I can@ @not , as a matter of certainty , state positively that I was
there over one hour on the 5th of July , nor a quarter of an hour ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.546

but I will read it from my notes if I am allowed ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.547

I will swear positively that I was there for a quarter of an hour ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,145.548

I can@ @not swear who was on his legs speaking when I went into the
meeting , or whether any one was ; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.549

there were of course persons in the room whenever I went into the Corn
Exchange ; OCONNELL-1844-2,145.550

it was <P_146> mid-day on the 5th of July when I went there ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,146.551

I am sure I heard Mr. O'Connell there that day ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,146.552

but I can@ @not swear that I heard the whole of his speech ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,146.553

I went to the association about twelve or one o'clock ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,146.554

I can@ @not say when Mr. O'Connell came in , or whether he was there
when I arrived there ; OCONNELL-1844-2,146.555

but I swear he was there that day , and that I saw and heard him speak
there - OCONNELL-1844-2,146.556

I mean according to my note <paren> laughter <$$bracket> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,146.557

<P_178>

Mr. Freeman - Are you able to swear positively now was Mr. Ray there ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.559

I am , OCONNELL-1844-2,178.560

<paren> " Volunteers ' card " handed back to witness <$$paren> ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.561

witness thinks it was he who made the sketches from which Mr.
O'Connell's and other likenesses are lithographed in that card .
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.562

The witness in reply stated he sketched the likeness of Mr. O'Connell ,
of H. G. Flood , which witness copied from a picture in the College
Dining_Hall , to which he was accompanied by Mr. Davis ; of Owen Roe
O'Neil , which he copied from a likeness in print , which Mr.
O'Callaghan's brother brought to Mr. Holbrooke's place ; of Brian
Boroihme , which he copied from the frontispiece of " Keating's History
of Ireland , " which Mr. Holbrooke brought to witness .
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.563

Look at the next likeness on the card ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.564

That is Ollam Fodlagh - OCONNELL-1844-2,178.565

<paren> a laugh <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,178.566

Where did you get his likeness ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.567

From my imagination - OCONNELL-1844-2,178.568

<paren> great laughter . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,178.569

Who suggested the name to you ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.570

Mr. Holbrooke . OCONNELL-1844-2,178.571

I heard the name discussed by Mr. Holbrooke , Mr. O'Callaghan , and
Mr. Davis . OCONNELL-1844-2,178.572

Look at the next likeness ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.573

That is Sarsfield OCONNELL-1844-2,178.574

Where did you get it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.575

From an old French engraving in the possession of Mr. Geraghty , the
bookseller . OCONNELL-1844-2,178.576

Who brought you there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.577

Mr. Holbrooke brought me to see it OCONNELL-1844-2,178.578

At whose suggestion was it put on the cards ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.579

I believe it was Mr. Holbrooke's wish to have it .
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.580

Look at the next ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.581

That is Hugh O'Neill . OCONNELL-1844-2,178.582

Where did you get that likeness ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.583

I think I composed it - OCONNELL-1844-2,178.584

<paren> laughter . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,178.585

Look at the next ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.586

That is King Dathy . OCONNELL-1844-2,178.587

Were you ever in the association ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.588

I <font> were <$$font> - <paren> a laugh <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.589

Did you see Mr. Ray there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.590

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,178.591

Did you engrave many of the volunteer cards ? OCONNELL-1844-2,178.592

I did not lithograph a very great number , as the stone employed in the
work was injured . OCONNELL-1844-2,178.593

I made some effort to repair the stone . OCONNELL-1844-2,178.594

The associates' cards were done about the beginning of last year .
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.595

The members' cards were done about the same time , and the volunteers'
cards about March . OCONNELL-1844-2,178.596

The card I have been just handed is called the repeal wardens' diploma ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.597

I designed it from materials furnished to me by Mr. Holbrook ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.598

the design was commenced before the beginning of the last year ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.599

during the progress of the work I saw Mr. Davis , the two Messrs.
O'Callaghan and Mr. Ray , come to inspect it ; OCONNELL-1844-2,178.600

I think Mr. Steele came to inspect some of the cards ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.601

no person was with him ; OCONNELL-1844-2,178.602

saw Mr. Duffy of the <font> Nation <$$font> come there with Mr. Davis
; OCONNELL-1844-2,178.603

I took a sketch of Mr. O'Connell's head at the association rooms ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.604

that was while the volunteer card was in progress ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.605

I have seen Mr. Ray and Mr. John O'Connell also at the association ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.606

I was there very rarely except on business ; OCONNELL-1844-2,178.607

I went to the meetings of the association about five or six times , for
the purpose of sketching ; OCONNELL-1844-2,178.608

I do not remember to have seen Mr. Duffy there or Dr. Gray ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.609

I saw Dr. Gray at Mr. Holbrooke's ; OCONNELL-1844-2,178.610

I recollect Mr. Ray suggesting an alteration in the harp on the card ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.611

in the original form the harp was like an English harp , and not like an
Irish one ; OCONNELL-1844-2,178.612

Mr. O'Callaghan suggested an alteration in the cap of the chief ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.613

I at first put a spike on the top of it , which he thought was not
correct , according to his notion of history ; OCONNELL-1844-2,178.614

I had nothing to do with the striking off of the diplomas ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,178.615

and I do not know how many were printed ; OCONNELL-1844-2,178.616

I was enrolled a member of the Repeal Association , but not with my
consent . OCONNELL-1844-2,178.617

<P_179>

Mr. Fitzgibbon - How do you know you were enrolled ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.619

I had a card handed to me by Mr. Holbrooke . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.620

Mr. Fitzgibbon - That is not evidence . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.621

Witness - I sketched Mr. John O'Connell in a room up-stairs at the
Corn-Exchange ; OCONNELL-1844-2,179.622

that was according to appointment ; OCONNELL-1844-2,179.623

I made the appointment with him while riding on the railway ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.624

I understand it was a private sketch for Mr. Holbrooke .
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.625

Mr. M=c=Donogh - That is not evidence , OCONNELL-1844-2,179.626

Witness - I was once before , up-stairs , at the Corn-Exchange , in what
I believe is called the committee-room ; OCONNELL-1844-2,179.627

I went there to sketch from a bust of Mr. O'Connell which they have
there . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.628

Mr. Freeman - Who brought you there to sketch that bust ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.629

Mr. M=c=Donogh objected to the question as not being evidence .
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.630

Mr. Freeman - Were you paid for the services you performed ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.631

I <font> were , <$$font> Sir <paren> a laugh <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.632

The witness bent down towards the members of the bar who were laughing ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.633

and correcting himself , said , with much emphasis , " I was , " <paren>
loud laughter <$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.634

<heading>

Cross-examined by Mr. M=c=Donough . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.636

<$$heading>

You are an artist ? OCONNELL-1844-2,179.638

I am , Sir . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.639

Your studio was , I suppose , open to the public ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.640

and was , no doubt , visited by Mr. Stewart Blacker and other
connoisseurs ? OCONNELL-1844-2,179.641

I do not remember seeing that clever gentleman there .
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.642

Is he clever ? OCONNELL-1844-2,179.643

I think so from what I have heard of him . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.644

Do you remember seeing any of my artistic friends around me at your
studio ? OCONNELL-1844-2,179.645

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.646

Perhaps Mr. Tomb was there <paren> laughter <$$paren> ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.647

No I think not . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.648

I am persuaded many gentleman went there to see and to admire ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.649

I do@ @n't know about admiring , OCONNELL-1844-2,179.650

but many gentlemen did go there . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.651

I presume , if any of us went there , we would be allowed to see your
very meritorious works , Ollam Fodlah and the rest , including Dathy ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.652

I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.653

Who was he ? OCONNELL-1844-2,179.654

I believe he is only known to the Irish people . <paren> a laugh
<$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.655

I believe Mr. Holbrooke was pretty well known to be in the service of
the government ; OCONNELL-1844-2,179.656

he had the words " Lithographer to the Queen " on the glass of his
window ; OCONNELL-1844-2,179.657

that was one of the first things that struck me when I came to Ireland ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.658

Mr. Holbrooke worked for the government and for the Repeal Association
at the same time . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.659

Mr. M=c=Donough - I am not alluding to his recent business for the

Witness - It was I who designed the " Sun-burst " on the card ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.661

the merit of that design should be pretty equally divided between Mr.
Holbrooke and myself ; OCONNELL-1844-2,179.662

I think , notwithstanding that , I am still a loyal subject to the Queen
. OCONNELL-1844-2,179.663

Who was Mr. Flood ? OCONNELL-1844-2,179.664

He was a contemporary of Mr. Grattan . OCONNELL-1844-2,179.665

I saw Mr. Steele there once , on a matter wholly irrevelant to the
subject of the card ; OCONNELL-1844-2,179.666

I saw Dr. Gray there also , viewing the premises ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.667

I remember his looking at and inspecting the premises ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,179.668

I am wholly unacquainted with Mr. Barrett ; OCONNELL-1844-2,179.669

I never saw him that I remember ; OCONNELL-1844-2,179.670

and the interview with Mr. John O'Connell was private , having
reference merely to taking his <P_180> likeness ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,180.671

I have been here since Wednesday evening , OCONNELL-1844-2,180.672

and I have not seen Mr. Holbrooke ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.673

I was in England up to that time ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.674

I was in London since August last . OCONNELL-1844-2,180.675

Do you know the fact that Mr. Holbrooke is in Dublin at present ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,180.676

I believe him to be so . OCONNELL-1844-2,180.677

Did you part with Mr. Holbrooke voluntary ? OCONNELL-1844-2,180.678

Isaac Gardner examined by Mr. Martley - OCONNELL-1844-2,180.682

I am a writing engraver ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.683

I was in the employment of Mr. Holbrooke , as an engraver , from
February to the latter end of June , 1843 ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.685

I engraved the letters upon these <paren> members' <$$paren> cards for

OCONNELL-1844-2,180.686

I executed the writing upon the associates' cards ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,180.687

I engraved the whole of it ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.688

I did it before the members' cards ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.689

the banners were upon the plate when brought to me ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,180.690

Mr. Holbrooke gave me that work to do ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.691

; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.692

OCONNELL-1844-2,180.693

I put it upon it from an autograph supposed to be that of Mr. Ray ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,180.694

To Mr. Martley - A person named Annesley was in Mr. Holbrooke's
employment ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.708

I never saw him take away any impression from the office .

To Mr Moore - Mr. Holbrooke did a good deal of business - amongst the
rest for the government ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.710

OCONNELL-1844-2,180.711

I received directions from Mr. Holbrooke in the ordinary course of
business ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.712

and I received the orders in that way too ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.713

everything was executed openly , OCONNELL-1844-2,180.714

nothing was done in mystery ; OCONNELL-1844-2,180.715

the designing for the cards was as public and open as if it were done
for the government . OCONNELL-1844-2,180.716

Joseph Annesley examined by Mr. Barker - OCONNELL-1844-2,181.747

I know Mr. Holbrooke , the engraver , of Crow-street ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.748

and have been in his employment , as printer , for eighteen months .
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.749

<paren> The associates' card was here handed to witness . <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.750

I have been engaged in printing cards of this description at Mr.
Holbrooke's ; OCONNELL-1844-2,181.751

I have seen such cards at his house , OCONNELL-1844-2,181.752

and have carried parcels of them from Mr. Holbrooke's to the
Corn-Exchange ; OCONNELL-1844-2,181.753

I left them at the top of the house , having delivered them there to the
clerks , whose names I do not know ; OCONNELL-1844-2,181.754

I heard of a person named Quigley , OCONNELL-1844-2,181.755

and delivered cards to him ; OCONNELL-1844-2,181.756

he was one of the clerks of the Corn-Exchange . OCONNELL-1844-2,181.757

The witness then stated he carried parcels of the volunteers' cards to
the Corn-Exchange , and that he had seen them brought there by others ;
also the repeal wardens' diploma , and the other cards .
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.758

Cross-examined by Mr. Macarthy - OCONNELL-1844-2,181.759

Was in the habit of taking many brown paper parcels from Holbrooke's to
the Corn-Exchange ; OCONNELL-1844-2,181.760

Mr. Holbrooke is in town at present . OCONNELL-1844-2,181.761

The Attorney_General called upon the officer to read to the jury the
associates' card , the members' green card , and the volunteers' card ,
which were proved by the witness . OCONNELL-1844-2,181.762

Mr. Fitzgibbon desired that the officer should read the inscription
attached to each of the leaves on the shamrock in the green card .
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.763

The Court said the officer had already done so .
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.764

The officer then read the repeal wardens' diploma .
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.765

The Attorney_General said the next document to be read was the deed of
submission to the arbitrators' award . OCONNELL-1844-2,181.766

Mr. Fitzgibbon objected on the ground that it had a stamp upon it ; it
came from the hands of the crown , and no document whatever , with a
stamp to it , was proved to have been at any time issued by the
association . OCONNELL-1844-2,181.767

The Chief_Justice said he did not understand the objection .
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.768

The learned counsel then repeated it , OCONNELL-1844-2,181.769

and argued that the document should not be received , as the traversers
never delivered any paper with a stamp upon it , upon any occasion
whatever . OCONNELL-1844-2,181.770

Chief_Justice - They do@ @n't read the stamp against you .
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.771

Mr. Fitzgibbon - Let them cut it off then , OCONNELL-1844-2,181.772

but I object to its going to the jury as it is .
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.773

Chief_Justice - They do not want to use the stamp against you .
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.774

Judge Perrin - The stamp can@ @not be sent to the jury without your
consent , OCONNELL-1844-2,181.775

or at all events it does not alter the import of the document .
OCONNELL-1844-2,181.776

Mr. Fitzgibbon still urged his objection , OCONNELL-1844-2,181.777

and the Solicitor_General was about to reply , when , <P_182> the
{TEXT:The} Chief_Justice said the learned Solicitor need not trouble
himself upon the subject , as the court were unanimously of opinion the
document should be read . OCONNELL-1844-2,182.778

The officer then read the document , which was in blank , and also a
blank copy of the arbitrators' award thereupon .
OCONNELL-1844-2,182.779

John Ulick Macnamara , examined by Mr. Tomb {TEXT:Towb} , Q. C. -
OCONNELL-1844-2,182.780

I am a short-hand writer , OCONNELL-1844-2,182.781

and was present at a repeal meeting at Tullamore on the 16th of July
last ; OCONNELL-1844-2,182.782

I arrived there the evening before the meeting ; OCONNELL-1844-2,182.783

the proceedings commenced about two o'clock ; OCONNELL-1844-2,182.784

I observed the people coming into Tullamore as they would have been
{TEXT:seen} coming to market ; OCONNELL-1844-2,182.785

there were great crowds {TEXT:growds} ; OCONNELL-1844-2,182.786

I took a note in short-hand of what passed at the meeting ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,182.787

and copied my notes out with the exception of a few sentences ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,182.788

my short-hand notes have been destroyed ; OCONNELL-1844-2,182.789

I have my transcribed notes here . OCONNELL-1844-2,182.790

Witness produced the transcribed copies of his notes ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,182.791

and said he saw Mr. D. O'Connell and Mr. Steele at the meeting ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,182.792

the Rev. Mr. O'Raffrety presided . OCONNELL-1844-2,182.793

Mr. Tomb - Turn to your transcribed note OCONNELL-1844-2,182.794

and tell their lordships and the jury what the chairman said at that
meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,182.795

Mr. Hatchell <paren> to witness <$$paren> - Do you mean that your
transcribed copy of the short-hand notes you say you took at the
Tullamore meeting is {TEXT:in} an accurate verbatim representation of
what occured there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,182.796

Yes , with the exception of a few sentences ; OCONNELL-1844-2,182.797

I took notes of some sentences which I omitted in the transcribed copy .
OCONNELL-1844-2,182.798

Then the short-hand notes would show certain parts of the speeches
{TEXT:speechs} delivered at this meeting , which do not appear in the
transcribed copy ? OCONNELL-1844-2,182.799

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,182.800

Is there any portion of that which you transcribed supplied by your
memory , and not in the short-hand notes ? OCONNELL-1844-2,182.801

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,182.802

Do you mean to say that there is not one substantial or substantive word
in the report you are now going to read , which was not taken down by
you in short hand ? OCONNELL-1844-2,182.803

I do . OCONNELL-1844-2,182.804

And that the sentences in the short-hand notes are all , with the
exception of the few you described , correct representations of what was
said at the meeting - OCONNELL-1844-2,182.805

do you mean to say that ? OCONNELL-1844-2,182.806

I do . OCONNELL-1844-2,182.807

State what the Rev. Dr. O'Rafferty said at that meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,182.808

The witness proceeded to read the following speech : -
OCONNELL-1844-2,182.809

" Fellow-countrymen and brother repealers , the regenerator and
liberator of our country has come to pay you a visit .
OCONNELL-1844-2,182.810

Allow me to tell you that the mighty leader of the Irish people has come
to address you ; OCONNELL-1844-2,182.811

this is the first time we had the honour to see him at a public meeting
in the town of Tullamore . OCONNELL-1844-2,182.812

I do@ @n't say too much for the people of this locality when I assert
that they were at all times the ardent and sincere supporters of every
measure introduced by that great man for the benefit of the country .
OCONNELL-1844-2,182.813

He has come to talk to you about repeal . OCONNELL-1844-2,182.814

I believe you all know what that means ; OCONNELL-1844-2,182.815

he has come to bring back our native parliament , to establish a
legislature in this country that will make the laws for the benefit of
the people ; that will respect the rights of the people , and that will
give them good government . OCONNELL-1844-2,182.816

They have been too long trampled on by the representatives of Saxon
authority ; OCONNELL-1844-2,182.817

too long have they been trodden down and treated worse <P_183> than
slaves . OCONNELL-1844-2,183.818

That great and illustrious man will address you ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.819

he will tell you as he often told others , the great and lasting
blessings that a domestic legislature will bring to this country .
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.820

I return you thanks for the honour you have done me ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.821

for thirty years I have laboured sincerely for the public cause .
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.822

I have been a supporter according to my humble means of every measure
{TEXT:measue} introduced for the good of the country ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.823

and my exertions shall not be wanting to forward the great cause of
repeal . " OCONNELL-1844-2,183.824

Examination continued - OCONNELL-1844-2,183.825

Did a Mr. Flanagan address the meeting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,183.826

He did , very shortly . OCONNELL-1844-2,183.827

Did the Rev. Mr. Spain make a speech , OCONNELL-1844-2,183.828

and , if he did , read it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,183.829

The witness replied that he did , OCONNELL-1844-2,183.830

and proceeded to read it as follows : - OCONNELL-1844-2,183.831

" On occasions of a nature similar to the present it has lately been
often said , ' This is a great day for Ireland ; '
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.832

but I may be permitted to say that this is a glorious day for the King's
County ; OCONNELL-1844-2,183.833

this day the King's County has nobly done its duty ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.834

and the truth of this assertion is fully borne out by the display which
I now witness . OCONNELL-1844-2,183.835

But a few short months ago we had a meeting at another end of this
county - at Birr ; at which the Liberator did us the honour to attend .
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.836

It was one of those meetings in which Ireland put forth her moral
strength ; OCONNELL-1844-2,183.837

the people assembled in hundreds of thousands determined that she shall
be a nation . OCONNELL-1844-2,183.838

As I had then an opportunity of expressing my sentiments on the subject
of repeal , I shall now take leave to read the resolution that has been
put into my hands . OCONNELL-1844-2,183.839

<paren> The reverend gentleman then read the first resolution <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.840

Whatever be the views of public men with regard to maintaining or
repealing the act of union , no man of common sense and common honesty
can deny the truth of that resolution ; OCONNELL-1844-2,183.841

no man can deny the reckless character of the men by whom the union was
proposed , or the infamous means which were adopted to carry it ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.842

and if it be equally true that the distressful consequences too truly
predicted have been literally fulfilled , on what ground can any
Irishman wish to see it maintained . OCONNELL-1844-2,183.843

That Englishmen should be for the union , that even Englishmen of
liberal principles should be for it , is not surprising because it
confers benefits upon their country ; OCONNELL-1844-2,183.844

but no Irishman ought to hesitate a moment in demanding its immediate
repeal , because for every good it did to England it caused an injury to
Ireland . " OCONNELL-1844-2,183.845

Examination continued - OCONNELL-1844-2,183.846

Did the Rev. Mr. Nolan , of Dunkerrin , make a speech at the meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.847

The witness replied in the affirmative , OCONNELL-1844-2,183.848

and read the reverend gentleman's speech , in which he moved the
adoption of a petition to parliament for a Repeal of the Union .
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.849

Was the resolution seconded ? OCONNELL-1844-2,183.850

It was , OCONNELL-1844-2,183.851

and carried . OCONNELL-1844-2,183.852

Did the Rev. Mr. Kearney speak ? OCONNELL-1844-2,183.853

He did ! OCONNELL-1844-2,183.854

Read his speech ? OCONNELL-1844-2,183.855

The witness then read the speech in question , which was as follows : -
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.856

I hold in my hand a resolution for the adoption of this great and
important meeting , pledging them to perseverance in the agitation that
has been set on foot by the Liberator of the country , and has continued
so long to the great credit of the nation . OCONNELL-1844-2,183.857

As no political good was ever achieved by depressing the people , so no
public grievance was ever redressed but through the exertion ,
determination , and preseverance of the people .
OCONNELL-1844-2,183.858

Our position at present is a glorious one , OCONNELL-1844-2,183.859

and you have only to persevere a little longer to make your country
independent and prosperous . OCONNELL-1844-2,183.860

Now that the determination of the nation has been fixed <P_184> on the
return of their legislature as it is to-day , can any man doubt that
under the guidance of our great leader we shall soon obtain it ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.861

and in fact the ministry that govern us , and who thought a few weeks
ago that by the exhibition of some red coats among us they could fright
the land from its propriety , have been miserably disappointed by that
tone of defiance with which they were met . OCONNELL-1844-2,184.862

The father of his country , though given always to peace , hurled back ,
and in proper time , a bold defiance to Peel and Wellington .
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.863

That defiance had its effect , OCONNELL-1844-2,184.864

and the valiant ministry were somewhat in the position of Bob Acres in
the play - OCONNELL-1844-2,184.865

their courage began to ooze out at their fingers' ends .
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.866

The last speech of the Premier announces that the idea of coercion has
been given up entirely . OCONNELL-1844-2,184.867

What then will they do ? OCONNELL-1844-2,184.868

Do they intend then to concede repeal immediately ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.869

Every one sees they must do it in the end ; OCONNELL-1844-2,184.870

for " Freedom's battle once begun , Tho' baffled oft , is ever won . '
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.871

Repeal will be won , and I doubt no very distant day .
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.872

Peel has admitted the evils of Ireland , and that he has no remedy ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.873

he must give up to somebody . OCONNELL-1844-2,184.874

Every one was tired of him , OCONNELL-1844-2,184.875

and our beloved Queen <paren> Mr. O'Connell - Three cheers for the
Queen , <$$paren> you may be assured will be delighted to receive Peel's
resignation as Premier some fine morning one of these days .
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.876

The Whigs , who boast of having conferred so much on Ireland , and boast
more of what they would confer were it not for the opposition of the
Tories , would of course come in . OCONNELL-1844-2,184.877

They imagine that by a course of liberal government in Ireland they
could put a stop to the repeal agitation - by giving up the church
temporalities ; that by enlarging the franchise and increasing the
constituency in Ireland , they hope to detach us from the great and
paramount consideration of this question . OCONNELL-1844-2,184.878

They might concede all these , and even more . OCONNELL-1844-2,184.879

Most likely they would tempt the Liberator with fine promises in
addition to some good acts ; OCONNELL-1844-2,184.880

but he was too wise for them ; OCONNELL-1844-2,184.881

he has never yet over-reached by an English government ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.882

he has always been the watchful , wary , and undeceived advocate of his
country's wrongs ; OCONNELL-1844-2,184.883

and we may safely leave him to take everything that they give ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.884

but as soon as he gets all , never was the steam of repeal up till then
. OCONNELL-1844-2,184.885

Allow me , then , not to take up your time any longer , to read the
resolutions . " OCONNELL-1844-2,184.886

Mr. Tomb - Was anything said or done by the people surrounding the
platform ? OCONNELL-1844-2,184.887

Yes ; there were shouts of " repeal , repeal , repeal . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.888

Have you in your notes anything spoken by Mr. S. Robinson ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,184.889

I have . OCONNELL-1844-2,184.890

Mr. Tomb , stated that he would not call the witness to read it unless
required by the traversers . OCONNELL-1844-2,184.891

The traversers' counsel having made no observation , the examination was
continued . OCONNELL-1844-2,184.892

Mr. Tomb desired the witness to refer to Mr. O'Connell's speech ,
which he was proceeding to do until interupted by The Attorney_General ,
who stated that he had just been informed that two of the traversers had
left the court to attend a meeting , which was a proceeding he could not
aequiesce in , although he had not objected to their leaving the court
occasionally {TEXT:accasionally} , if they did not go from about the
<P_185> precincts ; when he heard that two of them had left purposely to
attend a meeting , he should insist upon their attendance , or he would
have them called upon their recognisances . OCONNELL-1844-2,185.893

Mr. Moore - They will be sent for . OCONNELL-1844-2,185.894

<paren> Messengers were then despatched for Mr. O'Connell and Mr.
Steele , the two traversers alluded to , who had left the court for the
purpose of attending a meeting at the Conciliation Hall ; shortly after
which they returned and took their places , in which they remained for
the rest of the day . {COM:missing_close_paren} OCONNELL-1844-2,185.895

Mr. Tomb - Have you Mr. O'Connell's speech at that meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,185.896

I have . OCONNELL-1844-2,185.897

Read it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,185.898

The witness then read the speech in question , from which we extract the
following : - OCONNELL-1844-2,185.899

" I rise to address you upon a new topic , that I scarcely ever touched
on before . OCONNELL-1844-2,185.900

I have a new theme now to dilate upon , OCONNELL-1844-2,185.901

and it is with infinite pleasure that I now announce to you the
certainty of our carrying the repeal of the union .
OCONNELL-1844-2,185.902

When I addressed former multitudinous assemblages of the people , I
endeavoured to show them the advantages that would result from a repeal
of the union ; that nothing would do good for Ireland , but the
restoration of her own parliament ; OCONNELL-1844-2,185.903

upon that topic I dilated often , OCONNELL-1844-2,185.904

and was able to demonstrate that Ireland must continue in misery unless
she had her own parliament ; OCONNELL-1844-2,185.905

my object was , to excite them to exertion , OCONNELL-1844-2,185.906

and I threw in the ingredient of hope , because a struggle without hope
is a vain and tedious operation ; OCONNELL-1844-2,185.907

but now I need not talk of hope , OCONNELL-1844-2,185.908

for I came here to-day to announce the certainty of repeal .
OCONNELL-1844-2,185.909

In my former addresses I called upon the people to aid me in the
struggle I was making ; OCONNELL-1844-2,185.910

I continue that call still , OCONNELL-1844-2,185.911

but I have to add to it that success is placed beyond all possibility of
doubt . OCONNELL-1844-2,185.912

You have only to persevere and redouble your exertions if possible ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,185.913

and the battle will be won . OCONNELL-1844-2,185.914

We have got upon 'vantage-ground , OCONNELL-1844-2,185.915

and must not only endeavour to keep it , OCONNELL-1844-2,185.916

but we must advance still further on the road to victory :
OCONNELL-1844-2,185.917

and it is as certain that we shall carry repeal as that the sun is now
shining upon you . OCONNELL-1844-2,185.918

To be sure , that certainty is to be attributed chiefly to our own
simultaneous exertions , from which success so far has entirely resulted
; OCONNELL-1844-2,185.919

but I mean to show that it arises also from the acts of our bitterest
enemies . OCONNELL-1844-2,185.920

When I was a counsel practising at the bar , I always liked to prove my
case from the mouths of the witnesses who were produced against me ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,185.921

and the witnesses I mean now to call to attest that we will have the
certainty of repeal , are Peel and Wellington , and thus to prove by the
evidence of those most hostile to me , the case of my present client -
Ireland . OCONNELL-1844-2,185.922

Yes , the present administration have proclaimed , trumpet-tongued ,
that repeal is inevitable ; OCONNELL-1844-2,185.923

and though they threatened at first to bully and coerce Ireland , I have
the subsequent testimony of their own mouths that they had not the power
to carry their illegal and unconstitutional threats into execution .
OCONNELL-1844-2,185.924

Like the fool who came to a river and stood by the side in the hope that
all the water would run by that he might pass over dry , this is the
position in which Peel and Wellington are now . OCONNELL-1844-2,185.925

They at first determined to wait till the tide of agitation had passed
by and repeal should be heard of no more ; OCONNELL-1844-2,185.926

but when the call for repeal was raised by half a million of voices
which increased every time I addressed <P_186> them ; when this was
announced up starts the Iron Duke , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.927

and proclaimed a civil war - OCONNELL-1844-2,186.928

horse , {COM:comma_inverted_in_text} foot , and artillery were to be
poured in upon us ; OCONNELL-1844-2,186.929

and one of the most despicable statesmen , Lord Brougham , and a
creature called Beaumont , who calls himself a Catholic , like cur dogs
, now broke loose like a panic , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.930

and echoed to the cry . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.931

They proclaimed that they would let loose the dogs of war , and cut down
repeal - OCONNELL-1844-2,186.932

<paren> a voice , never . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,186.933

Do@ @n't be in a hurry ; OCONNELL-1844-2,186.934

I am going to say , that they themselves tell us now they will not do it
. OCONNELL-1844-2,186.935

Never were men so bewildered as they were , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.936

and never did men show such an utter disregard for character or
principle . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.937

At the same cry , Peel came down , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.938

and took the name of the Queen in vain , that is , he took it falsely ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,186.939

he declared that the Queen had said she would put down repeal .
OCONNELL-1844-2,186.940

I told him it was a lie - OCONNELL-1844-2,186.941

and , in terms as plain as were consistent with her station , the Queen
told him it was a lie - OCONNELL-1844-2,186.942

that is the plain English of it . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.943

Well , he next threatened us with a civil war . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.944

My reply was short and brief . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.945

The packet came in in the morning OCONNELL-1844-2,186.946

and announced that determination , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.947

and next day I had the association assembled . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.948

I stated that we broke no law , that we stood upon the constitution ,
and hurled back a high and haughty defiance . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.949

This line of bold and honest defiance had its effect -
OCONNELL-1844-2,186.950

the bullies pulled in their horns when they found they met with
resistance ; OCONNELL-1844-2,186.951

we went on with our meetings OCONNELL-1844-2,186.952

and the idea of coercion was given up . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.953

Our rulers have discovered that it would not be safe to become lawless
oppressors , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.954

and I will answer for the people that they will never give them the
slightest cause to attack them . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.955

When I addressed former meetings I told them
{COM:semantics_of_pseudo-imperative_but_nonfinite} to join me and all
would soon be right ; OCONNELL-1844-2,186.956

but now I tell you that it is all right , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.957

the nail is in the hole . <$$paren> {COM:sic} OCONNELL-1844-2,186.958

A voice - Drive it home . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,186.959

Ay , drive it home , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.960

and I will clench it on the other side . " OCONNELL-1844-2,186.961

After alluding to the plan of fixiety of tenure , Mr. O'Connell said -
" We do not want to turn the landlords adrift , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.962

but then they must be in a hurry to join us , because we are about to
carry repeal immediately , and from this spot , which is about the
centre of Ireland . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.963

I now call upon them to join me , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.964

but if they do not , let them take care that they do not regret it .
OCONNELL-1844-2,186.965

Let them now come forward and join the people , and they will be paid
more in respect than they are now paid in money OCONNELL-1844-2,186.966

Oh ! go home OCONNELL-1844-2,186.967

and circulate the good news , that after centuries of oppression we
shall obtain freedom because we deserve it . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.968

Spies and informers have invented the Ribbon society ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,186.969

but if any man in your county becomes a Ribbonman , catch hold of the
man who made him so , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.970

and bring him to justice . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.971

Let every man who promises me that he will catch a Ribbonman , hold up
his hand . " OCONNELL-1844-2,186.972

Mr. M=c=Donough - What was done then ? OCONNELL-1844-2,186.973

I have no note of what was done . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.974

Mr. Tomb - Do you remember what was done ? OCONNELL-1844-2,186.975

The crowd held up their hands . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.976

The reading of the document was proceeded with as follows : -
OCONNELL-1844-2,186.977

Oh , now I have your pledge , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.978

and no honest Irishman ever broke his pledge . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.979

Have I not teetotallers here <paren> yes <$$paren> ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,186.980

I am proud of your confidence . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.981

I can collect you together at any time . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.982

If I want you I can get you any day in the week OCONNELL-1844-2,186.983

<paren> a voice , " The sooner you want us the better " <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,186.984

I am not deluding you , OCONNELL-1844-2,186.985

but I am able to prove in any court what are the blessings of repeal ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,186.986

and it is impossible that the people of Ireland can remain any longer in
slavery . OCONNELL-1844-2,186.987

I am able to demonstrate that the people of Ireland <P_187> are the most
manly in the world . OCONNELL-1844-2,187.988

Oh ! little the Saxon knows the gentleness of manners that arises under
religious enthusiasm . OCONNELL-1844-2,187.989

But if it should be necessary for you to remain in the field till blood
shall flow , general never stood by such soldiers ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.990

I have the bravest and most moral people in the world to deal with ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.991

but you must combine , OCONNELL-1844-2,187.992

there must be no treachery among you , OCONNELL-1844-2,187.993

and it is treachery to vote for any one but a repealer .
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.994

I have heard of some parish in this county where some repealers voted
for a Tory ; OCONNELL-1844-2,187.995

however , we will say no more about it at present ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.996

but now I give command never to vote for any Tory , nor for any else but
a Repealer . OCONNELL-1844-2,187.997

A friend of mine was coming down from Dublin , OCONNELL-1844-2,187.998

and saw a man working in a kind of Botany Bay of his own ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.999

a number of men were working together near him ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1000

but left him to work in a part by himself , solitary and alone ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1001

and refused to hold any intercourse with him . OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1002

My friend was afraid that they belonged to some secret society ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1003

and addressing them , said that he hoped that they were not Ribbonmen ,
that they refused to let that poor fellow into their company ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1004

but what was their answer - OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1005

' O , that fellow refused to become a repealer . '
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1006

These good men were combined for the cause of repeal ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1007

and it is absolutely necessary that you should be doubly active now ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1008

I can@ @not afford to leave out , man , woman , or child , without
becoming repealers . OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1009

Let every one join with me in the call for repeal , and the shout will
reverbrate to England ; OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1010

the Saxon will be aroused from his slumber , OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1011

the echo will be borne on the wild waves , OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1012

and the union shall be , must be repealed . " OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1013

Mr. Tomb - On what day of the week was the meeting held ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1014

On Sunday . OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1015

The court here adjourned for a short time . OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1016

Examination resumed - OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1017

The meeting was held on Sunday in the Market-square of the town of
Tullamore ; OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1018

I can form no estimate of the numbers assembled on the occasion ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1019

I saw a great number of flags and banners displayed both in the streets
and at the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1020

Mr. Tomb - State to the jury if you saw any of the incriptions on these
banners what they were . OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1021

One was " See the Conquering Hero comes . " Another - " Breathes there
a man with soul so dead Who never to himself hath said , This is my own
, my native land " <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1022

Mr. Tomb - Any more ? OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1023

Yes ; " Ireland , her Parliament , or the world in a blaze , " and "
Cead mille failtha , " OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1024

A Juror - Was the banner on which were the words , " Ireland , her
Parliament , the world in a blaze , " displayed at the meeting or in the
town ? OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1025

I saw it before the meeting took place in one of the streets .
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1026

To Mr. Tomb - There were a great many bands of music there ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1027

the meeting lasted about two hours {COM:missing_period}
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1028

<heading>

Cross-examined by J. Hatchell , Esq. , Q. C.
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1030

<$$heading>

I arrived in Tullamoore on the evening before the meeting ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1032

I went to the Market-place before any crowd had gathered ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1033

there was a platform , erected for the speakers ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1034

I was on it ; OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1035

saw one reporter there , OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1036

and understood there were others ; OCONNELL-1844-2,187.1037

there was not the least obstruction to my taking <P_188> notes ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1038

the people assembled as if they were coming to a market or a fair ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1039

there was a great number of females amongst them , and some children ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1040

everything appeared perfectly peaceable , so far as the conduct of the
persons there ; OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1041

I do not belong to that part of the country . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1042

Mr. Hatchell - By whom were you employed to go to the meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1043

By Captain Despard . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1044

Mr. Tomb - I object to that question . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1045

The witness had no right to answer it . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1046

Mr. Justice Crampton - It is over now . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1047

Mr. Hatchell - Were you ever employed for any newspaper ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1048

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1049

Were you there on the part of the government . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1050

The Chief_Justice - You must not answer that question .
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1051

Mr. Hatchell - The question was put in Mr. Bond Hughes's case ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1052

and it was answered . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1053

The Chief_Justice - The point was different . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1054

The cross-examination of the witness was then proceeded with .
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1055

I did not go to the meeting for any of the Liberal papers ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1056

I did not go {TEXT:to} there for any newspaper .
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1057

Were you paid for your report ? OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1058

No ; I was not . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1059

Then as yet you have not been paid for your services ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1060

I have not , OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1061

and I am very much afraid I never will <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1062

Mr. Hatchell - I do@ @n't at all participate in your terrors in that
respect . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1063

Witness continued - I did not transcribe my notes for several days after
the meeting , OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1064

and that was the reason I was not paid ; OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1065

I did not send them in time ; OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1066

I did not transcribe them until about six days after the meeting ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1067

I did so at home at Trim . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1068

Had you been applied to for your report ? OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1069

I understood an application was made at my house for it ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1070

but I was not at home at the time , OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1071

and that was the reason why I did not write it out sooner ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1072

I went home after the meeting broke up ; OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1073

I took my notes on loose slips of paper ; OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1074

after I retired from the meeting , I went away OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1075

and did not return home for two days ; OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1076

I certainly understood when I went to the meeting to take notes , that I
was to be paid for doing so , OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1077

but no price had been specified ; OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1078

I was employed as a reporter for a Drogheda paper about twelve months
previously , OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1079

but I was not connected with any newspaper in the meantime .
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1080

Then you were out of practice for twelve months ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1081

Not quite out of practice , OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1082

for I often took notes at the assizes , OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1083

but I did not transcribe them ; OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1084

I was not written to for my report . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1085

How did you come to make it out ? OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1086

I knew I would be asked for it . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1087

I think I had the report completely transcribed in six days after the
meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1088

How long did you take to transcribe it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1089

I can@ @not say exactly . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1090

Did you do it in two days {TEXT:day-} ? OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1091

I can@ @not say positively . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1092

But you must be positive , as near as you can ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1093

I can@ @not . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1094

Will you swear {TEXT:swere} that you did it in three days ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1095

I must have the time , OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1096

so be very minute ? OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1097

I really can@ @not say ; OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1098

I was to be paid by the job ; OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1099

I was paid for newspaper work by the year . OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1100

And you will not tell me how long it took you to transcribe these notes
of yours ? OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1101

I can@ @not ; OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1102

I did not transmit a transcript of my notes , OCONNELL-1844-2,188.1103

<P_189>

nor did I intend to transmit them unless applied for .
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1105

They were applied for during my absence from home as I have already said
; OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1106

the message that came to my house in my absence was not in writing ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1107

I was told the day after I came home that if the report was not sent
that evening by post , it would be too late ; OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1108

I had not got them ready OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1109

and conceived then that it was too late . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1110

And yet you went to the hard work of transcribing your notes after that
? OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1111

I thought it might possibly not be too late ; OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1112

I thought it might be to hurry me . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1113

Then upon possibility you sat down to do the work ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1114

I did ; OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1115

can@ @not say how long I took to do it ; OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1116

I did not know that I was taking the notes to be {TEXT:he} used .
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1117

Did you not know that you were to be examined as to the accuracy of your
notes afterwards ? OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1118

Upon my oath I had no idea I should be examined ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1119

I had seen so many meetings passed over in the reports , of which I had
read language so - OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1120

Mr. Hatchell - Never mind that , <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1121

Whose fault was it that they were passed over ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1122

I ca@ @n't tell . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1123

Would you give your own opinion ? OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1124

Oh , I will give my opinion if you wish . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1125

Oh , never mind it . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1126

It was on speculation you sat down to write your notes ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1127

Yes ; on speculation . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1128

I knew that I could be examined , OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1129

but I thought it very improbable . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1130

To whom did you send the transcript of your notes after you finished
{TEXT:finshed} them ? OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1131

I did not send them at all . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1132

Well , how did they get out of your possession ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1133

I gave them to my brother-in-law to read , OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1134

and he gave them to a person - OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1135

I do@ @n't know whether {TEXT:ewhther} I should mention his name or not
. OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1136

Mr. Tomb objected . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1137

Mr. Hatchell - Upon your oath , did you give the transcript to your
brother , to be returned to you ? OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1138

Upon my oath they were to be returned . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1139

Did he return them ? OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1140

He did . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1141

Having got back into your possession , how did they get out of it again
? OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1142

My brother called to me a second time for them , for the same person to
show them to another person - <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1143

Why . how many <font> dramatis persona <$$font> were there in the farce
altogether - OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1144

first , there was your brother-in-law - OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1145

then there was a person unknown - then your brother-in-law again - and
then another person unknown ? OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1146

I will mention the persons , if necessary . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1147

Oh , you need not , as Mr. Tomb objects to it .
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1148

Mr. Tomb - Yes , I object . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1149

Mr. Hatchell - How many days was all this going on between you and your
brother-in-law ? OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1150

I can@ @not say . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1151

They were returned to me after some time by him ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1152

and I gave them back to him , OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1153

and I never saw them since until I saw them here .
OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1154

My brother-in-law was the person who transmitted them to the person of
whom I am to say nothing . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1155

What interval passed between the time you finished that transcript and
the time it ultimately left your possession ? OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1156

I can@ @not say exactly ; OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1157

it was more than a week . OCONNELL-1844-2,189.1158

<P_190>

Mr. Hatchell called on the witness to produce the transcript again ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1160

and the witness took it out of his pocket . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1161

You first made a rough draft from your short-hand notes ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1162

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1163

Then this is a fair copy from the rough draft ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1164

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1165

Where is the rough draft ? OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1166

It is destroyed . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1167

And the short-hand notes ? OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1168

Destroyed . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1169

When ? OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1170

I believe the same day , the rough draft . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1171

I dare say it was two months after the meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1172

I think it was not three months . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1173

I had them for a considerable time after the report had finally left my
possession . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1174

I did not take every sentence that was uttered ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1175

and often tried to finish sentences myself where parts were wanting in
my notes . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1176

Whole sentences may have been omitted . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1177

I think you mentioned in one part of your report something about a
Spanish profession ? OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1178

I know the passage you allude to ; OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1179

I said a profession in Spain or France . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1180

Whose system of short-hand do you write - Taylor's ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1181

No ; is it necessary that I should tell you ? OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1182

Oh , no . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1183

Witness <paren> looking over his transcript <$$paren> - I have the
passage - OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1184

" Because distinguished professors in Spain and France have proved that
there is not such a people on the face of the earth . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1185

Will you swear that was what was said ? OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1186

I will swear that I took it down so in my notes .
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1187

I will swear it was not Scotch professor that was said .
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1188

I am quite ready to swear that I took it down in my notes as I have read
it . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1189

But you do not mean to say you are infallible ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1190

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1191

Will you swear that you might not be mistaken ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1192

No , I will not . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1193

Do you know how to write short-hand at all ? OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1194

I do . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1195

Write professor and philosopher ? OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1196

The witness did so , OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1197

and Mr. Hatchell and Mr. O'Connell said the character he wrote for
professor was longer than the one he wrote for philosopher .
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1198

The witness - That often occurs . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1199

Mr. Hatehell - Did you see the placard about " The World in a blaze , "
in the market-place , when going to the meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1200

Oh , yes , hours before ; OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1201

I did not go through that street after the meeting , or any time before
I left the town ; OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1202

I do not know that it was taken down ; OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1203

I did not hear Mr. Steele direct it to be taken down ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1204

I heard Mr. Robinson suggest a plan to the meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1205

The witness then read his report of Mr. Robinson's speech , from which
the following is an extract : - OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1206

" Gentlemen , when Ireland asked bread , what did you get but a stone ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1207

and when you asked for the amelioration of your sad condition you got an
arms bill , a proof of their total ignorance of your wants and condition
. OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1208

But , if the provisions of that bill were not of the most insulting and
unconstitutional nature , and if it did not give the petty tyrant an
opportunity of trampleing still further upon the liberties of the people
, I should care nothing about it , OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1209

for we want no arms but our own two arms , and our head to guide them ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1210

and whilst we move under the counsel of the Liberator we shall be sure
never to make a bad use of them . OCONNELL-1844-2,190.1211

We shall have recourse only to that moral warfare which tyrants never
understood before ; a new species of warfare , a warfare more likely to
restore the liberties of Ireland <P_191> than all the armies in Europe .
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1212

We want amelioration , OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1213

and are anxious to do harm to no one , but to do good for ourselves .
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1214

Instead of an arms bill they ought to give us another bill ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1215

they ought to give us fixity of tenure to better the condition of the
poor landholders . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1216

Our tenants ought to be paid for their improvements ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1217

and the landlords ought not to be allowed to drive or distress their
tenants unless they gave leases for three lives or thirty-one years .
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1218

I think you like that , that would be a good arms bill , that is the
arms bill we want . " OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1219

Mr. Hatchell applied to the court for a copy of the notes of the
witness . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1220

Mr. Tomb objected ; OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1221

he did not think the learned counsel was entitled to the notes .
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1222

The court ruled with Mr. Tomb . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1223

Mr. Hatchell - Have you been reading the whole of the report from
beginning to end ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1224

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1225

I think you stated it was moved that a petition to parliament be
presented ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1226

Yes , it was . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1227

Look at your notes OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1228

and say who moved that ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1229

The Rev. Mr. Nolan . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1230

I suppose you have no objection to that note of your testimony being
perfectly public - OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1231

you have no objection to swearing to the truth of it ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1232

As far as I am concerned I have not . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1233

Is not the report your property ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1234

I do@ @n't know whose property it is . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1235

Is it not the produce of your labour , OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1236

do@ @n't you stand in the same position with regard to your report as
any other proprietor ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1237

I do@ @n't know . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1238

The witness then commenced to read the speech of the Rev. Mr. Nolan ,
which as follows : OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1239

- " Gentlemen , I beg leave to move the adoption of the petition to
parliament praying for a repeal of that fatal measure , the Union . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1240

Was that seconded ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1241

It was . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1242

By whom ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1243

By Dr. Walsh . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1244

In explanation of these names , perhaps I ought to observe , that very
few of the names were announced , and it was only from hearing enquiries
made as to who the speakers were , that I could catch the names .
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1245

The petition was moved to be presented to parliament ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1246

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1247

Have you a note of when that petition was moved ? {TEXT:.}
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1248

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1249

Tell me , Sir <paren> very seriously <$$paren> , for what are you
searching in your pocket ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1250

For my pocket handkerchief - <paren> much laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1251

I am sorry the question has such an effect upon you ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1252

did you take a note of the petition ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1253

I did not get it to take a note of it . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1254

Why not take a note of it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1255

I thought it would be given in the papers . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1256

Did you apply for it , OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1257

or did you expect it would drop along with your pocket handkerchief into
your pocket ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1258

I did not apply for it . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1259

You thought you were to get it though you never asked for it - eh ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1260

Did you ever read it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1261

I never did . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1262

Had you ever the curiosity to read it in the newspapers ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1263

Oh , I read it in the newspapers . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1264

Did you read it in many more newspapers than one ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1265

Yes , {TEXT:.;} I examined the reports of the proceedings of two
newspapers ; OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1266

I have no copy of the petition . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1267

What is the next note of any transaction which you have upon the paper ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1268

" A resolution moved , " OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1269

but I have not the copy of it . OCONNELL-1844-2,191.1270

<P_192>

Then some resolution was moved , of which you know nothing ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1272

Precisely . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1273

Who moved it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1274

The Rev. Mr. Kearney . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1275

Who seconded it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1276

Mr. Clarke . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1277

There was another resolution moved by Mr. O'Loughlin , seconded by Mr.
Ryan ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1278

Yes ; but I have not it . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1279

What was the next thing done ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1280

The reading of the petition to parliament was the next thing done .
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1281

What followed ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1282

Mr. O'Connell's speech . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1283

You told me you were taking notes at the table ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1284

I was . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1285

How did you destroy those notes ? {TEXT:;} OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1286

I threw some of them into the fire ; OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1287

my child cut some of them up . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1288

And the draft along with it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1289

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1290

Mr. Tomb to witness - You were asked if there were not other reporters
present ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1291

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1292

I said one ; OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1293

I understood there were more . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1294

Was he connected with a newspaper ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1295

I assume he was ; OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1296

he said he was . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1297

John Simpson Stewart sworn and examined by the Attorney-General -
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1298

You are a sub-inspector of the constabulary police ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1299

I am . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1300

Where were you stationed in July last ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1301

In Tullamore . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1302

Were you there on the day of the great meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1303

I was there on duty . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1304

Did you go around the town on the morning of the meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1305

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1306

Did you see any mottos or banners on your progress through the town ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1307

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1308

Mr. Justice Crampton - Was that before the meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1309

Yes , my lord . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1310

The Attorney-General - Was there any persons in the town beyond the
usual inhabitants on that day ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1311

Yes ; a very large number . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1312

What time was this ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1313

Between nine and ten o'clock in {TEXT:ln} the morning , great numbers
had come into the town ; OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1314

but the great body had not then arrived . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1315

What do you call a large number ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1316

Thousands of persons . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1317

Do you know the High-street of Tullamoore ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1318

I do . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1319

Did you observe any banners or mottos in the High-street ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1320

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1321

Mr. Henn - I object to that question . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1322

I submit that what the witness saw in the streets is not evidence in
this case . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1323

The Chief_Justice - Why not ? OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1324

Mr. Henn - Because it does not appear when , or by whom they were put
up . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1325

This was seen before the actual meeting took place , and when a great
number of persons were in the town ; OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1326

but surely some further information should be given respecting it .
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1327

The banner might have been put up at any hour during the night ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1328

but that would not be evidence , if it was done before the meeting took
place . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1329

It does not appear in this case that it was put up or carried about by
anybody attending the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1330

The Chief_Justice - I do@ @n't know that it is necessary to show by whom
it was done , as the evidence now stands . OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1331

Observe this , Mr. Henn : OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1332

all the parts and particulars can@ @not be given at one time .
OCONNELL-1844-2,192.1333

What the witness has already stated amounts to this : that he was in the
town from the day of the great meeting , attending to his duty as an
officer of police ; that on the morning it took place , a vast number of
persons came into the town besides {TEXT:besides_besides} <P_193> the
ordinary residents , amounting to several thousands ; and that in the
exercise of his duty he went round to make his observations as to what
he should see , and he saw those multitudes collected and collecting in
different parts of the town with different banners and mottos .
OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1334

Mr. Henn - Pardon me , my lord , OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1335

that is the foundation of my objection . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1336

It does not appear that those mottos and banners were carried by any
persons who attended this meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1337

The Chief_Justice - You should have heard me out ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1338

you interrupted me too soon . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1339

I said that over and above and besides the persons belonging to the town
, there were thousands present in different parts of the town ; that ,
in the discharge of his duty he walked about to see what would take
place ; and that when he arrived in High-street , on his tour of
inspection , he saw sundry banners and mottos ; OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1340

but he did not say that they were brought in by the people ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1341

but he states , as a matter of fact , that in the course of the morning
, while preparing for the meeting that was to take place , he saw
certain mottos . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1342

Mr. Henn - With great respect , I submit , my lord , that he has not
stated where or by whom this motto or banner was put up .
OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1343

The Attorney_General - You have not allowed him ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1344

he had just reached High-street . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1345

Mr. Henn - What I objected to was his reading out these words before he
had laid the foundation , by stating where they took place .
OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1346

Mr. Justice Crampton - The witness says he saw this particular one in
High-street . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1347

Mr. Henn - Allowing that there were some banners there , the fact of
this motto or placard being posted in High-street , or any particular
street , surely is not evidence to affect the traversers here .
OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1348

The Chief_Justice - I see no possible objection to the evidence of the
witness . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1349

Mr. Justice Crampton - And if you look to the case of the " King <font>
v. <$$font> Hunt , " which was cited before , you will find that this
evidence exactly was given . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1350

The Attorney-General - In the " King <font> v. <$$font> Hunt , " it was
shown that placards were posted on the roads leading into the town , as
well as in the town itself {COM:missing_period} OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1351

Mr. Henn - I do@ @n't dispute that , OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1352

but I put the case of an assemblage in the town ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1353

and , surely , the evidence of a policeman as to what he saw in the town
, giving every thing that occurred before the meeting took place , can@
@not affect the traversers , OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1354

<font> non constat , <$$font> at all , by whom these placards were put
up . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1355

Suppose it was hereafter shewn that the persons attending the meeting
interfered to take down these placards ? OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1356

Surely , it should be shown that these were the acts of persons
attending the meetings , or that they were recognized by them , before
these facts were given in evidence . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1357

Examination resumed by the Attorney-General - OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1358

You say you saw these banners when they went round ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1359

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1360

The people were then coming in ? OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1361

Yes , they were into the town . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1362

Did any of the persons come in through High-street ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1363

Yes , great numbers . OCONNELL-1844-2,193.1364

<P_194>

What direction is High street out of the town ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1366

The Birr road , OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1367

and numbers came from that place . OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1368

Will you give me the motto on the banner in High-street ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1369

It was an arch , stretching across the whole street .
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1370

Was there any motto on it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1371

Mr. Henn - Now , my lords , here is an arch put across the street ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1372

it might have been put up the night before , or by other parties .
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1373

Mr. Justice Crampton - The same thing might be said of the platform .
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1374

I dare say the arch was not erected by the parties who came into the
town - OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1375

but that was decided in the case of the " King <font> v. <$$font> Hunt
. " OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1376

Mr. Fitzgibbon - That was an indictment for attending an unlawful
assembly . OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1377

The three first counts were for a conspiracy , and the fourth for
attending an unlawful assembly . OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1378

Now , allow me to state what is the evidence in this case .
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1379

A placard is found on a wall on the 18th July , OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1380

and there is nothing to show who put it up , or whose act it was .
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1381

What evidence can that be that Daniel O'Connell , or any of the
traversers at the bar , did commit a conspiracy .
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1382

The crown might as well give evidence of all the placards exhibited
about Dublin , including those of the tea shops <paren> laughter
<$$paren> , and matters of that sort . OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1383

I contend that the case of the " King <font> v. <$$font> Hunt " is not
the same as the present , that being merely a charge of attending an
unlawful assembly , and the placards were given in evidence to support
the charge , but they were not given in evidence to support the
conspiracy , nor was the court so absurd as to permit it .
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1384

There is not in this indictment an allegation that any of these meetings
were unlawful assemblies , OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1385

and how then can these placards be admitted in evidence .
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1386

The Attorney_General {TEXT:Ceneral} argued that the present case only
differed from that of the King against Hunt , inasmuch as the former was
a charge for conspiring to do what was actually done in the latter case
; OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1387

and he contended that in the one case , as well as in the other , it was
perfectly consistent to judge of the character of the assembly from the
banners and insriptions used at it . OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1388

In neither case was it shown that the banners had been carried or made
use of by any particular persons . OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1389

Chief_Justice - Nor was it necessary to do so .
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1390

The Attorney-General was aware that such was the case ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1391

and he argued that in the case of Radford and Burney , the special pleas
were for conspiracy , as in the present instance ; and in that case , as
well as in the case of the King <font> v. <$$font> Hunt , the flags and
banners were used as evidence . OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1392

He submitted , that in the present instance too , the flags and banners
could be used for the same purpose . OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1393

He would just observe that that was the first time he heard the decision
of the judges of the Queen's Bench , whose names {TEXT:nemes} had been
mentioned , characterized as absurd ; OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1394

and he regretted that such an expression should have been made use of in
that court . OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1395

Mr. Fitzgibbon denied that he applied the term " absurd " to the
decision of these learned judges . OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1396

What he said was , that they would not be guilty of such absurdity as to
decide in the way mentioned . OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1397

Mr. Whiteside said that no one could intend to say that , if four or
five persons carried banners or inscriptions , those banners or
inscriptions did not convey their sentiments ; OCONNELL-1844-2,194.1398

but here , where it did not appear that the <P_195> banners were used or
carried by any persons connected with the meeting , he contended that
they could not be used as an authority to judge of the sentiments and
opinions of persons assisting at or forming the meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1399

As well might it be said , that if a meeting was to be held at
Donnybrook , and an arch with inscriptions erected at Clontarf , those
inscriptions should be taken as a criterion of the sentiments of the
persons attending at the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1400

Chief_Justice - Unless we decide against common sense , we must decide
that the flags and banners employed on an occasion like that in question
may be taken to explain the character of the meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1401

Judge Crampton agreed with the chief_justice . OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1402

Justice Perrin said that surely the acts and declarations of an assembly
clearly showed the object of that assembly . OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1403

But here was an arch erected , not in a place remote from the place of
meeting , as Clontarf from Donnybrook in the hypothesis of Mr.
Whiteside , but on the direct road to it , and in its vicinity .
OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1404

If that arch were taken down before the meeting , he supposed such a
circumstance would appear in evidence ; OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1405

but if it were not taken down , but was suffered to remain during the
meeting , it was surely an evidence to show the feelings entertained by
persons at the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1406

Every case was not precisely alike , although it might have been decided
on similar principles ; OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1407

and hence they were not to wonder if the cases cited by the
Attorney-General were in some respects unlike the present one to which
they were applied . OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1408

Attorney-General <paren> to witness <$$paren> - State what inscriptions
were on the archway . OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1409

On one side was the following - " The slavemaster may brandish his whip
, but we are determined to be free ; " and on the other side - " Beware
of physical force , beware ! OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1410

Physical force is a dangerous experiment to try with the Irish people .
OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1411

Repeal will not be put down by the bayonet . {COM:missing_close_quote}
OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1412

Where in Tullamoore is the Roman_Catholic chapel ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1413

Opposite the Corn Market where the meeting was held .
OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1414

Was the latter place visible from it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1415

Yes , the place where the platform was erected could be seen from the
chapel door . OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1416

Was there any banner near the chapel gate ? OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1417

Yes ; opposite the chapel gate an archway was erected from one side of
the street to the other . OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1418

What inscription did it bear ? OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1419

" Ireland , her Parliament , or the world in a blaze . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1420

On what day of the week did this occur ? OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1421

On Sunday . OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1422

Did any of the thousands of persons who were in town go in that
direction ? OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1423

Yes {TEXT:Yet} ; they passed under it , OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1424

for the arch was erected at the principal {TEXT:principle} entrance to
the Corn Market . OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1425

The platform was exactly opposite to it . OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1426

Was there any banner about the platform ? OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1427

Yes , there was one exactly opposite the platform ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1428

the inscription was - " Ireland must not be , ought not to be , shall
not be a serf nation . " OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1429

Were there any mottos on the platform ? OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1430

Certainly ; OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1431

one of them was " Nine millions of people are too {TEXT:two} great to be
dragged at the tail of another nation . {COM:missing_close_quote}
OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1432

Mr. Hatchell - Were there any others ? OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1433

Yes ; another was , " He who commits a crime gives strength to the enemy
, " OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1434

and another was , " God save the Queen . " OCONNELL-1844-2,195.1435

<P_196>

Were there any others at the meeting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1437

Yes ; a great many , OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1438

and among the rest , " See the Conquering Hero comes , " " Cead mille
failtha , " " Peace and perseverance , " " Repeal , justice , and
prosperity , {TEXT:prosperty} to all creeds and classes . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1439

At what hour did the crowds begin to enter the town ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1440

Early in the morning , about ten o'clock , OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1441

and from that period they came in immense masses .
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1442

What were the principal roads ? OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1443

The greater number came by the Birr road . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1444

Were there any bands there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1445

Oh , yes ; a great number ; OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1446

I think about nine or ten , exclusive of the Tullamoore band .
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1447

Were they all temperance bands ? OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1448

I suppose they were . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1449

They came at different times ? OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1450

Yes ; with large numbers of the people . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1451

Were there persons on horseback coming in ? OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1452

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1453

Did you see anything in particular about the horsemen ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1454

Yes ; they were in sections of four . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1455

Judge Perrin - What do you mean by sections of four ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1456

Four abreast , my lord ; OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1457

four first , and then four after , and so on . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1458

Did you observe anything in particular about one horseman ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1459

Yes ; one of them wanted to leave his section , to stop at a particular
house , when the horseman said , " d-n you , keep your ranks . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1460

Did he obey that order ? OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1461

He did . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1462

Could you say about how many horseman came in sections ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1463

I counted seventy or eighty sections of fours , OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1464

but I can@ @not be particular . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1465

The Attorney_General - That would make about 320 ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1466

I calculated about 300 . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1467

Did you see anything particular about the persons on foot ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1468

They endeavoured to keep order in some kind of a way , but not with as
much success as the horsemen . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1469

The infantry on foot kept round the temperance bands ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1470

and were forced on by the crowd . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1471

Did you see any persons giving directions to those on foot ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1472

Yes ; apparently as giving them directions , OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1473

but I could not hear the words - OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1474

I think - OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1475

Mr. Henn - Stop , sir ; OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1476

do@ @n't go give illegal evidence {COM:missing_period}
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1477

What were they doing ? OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1478

Halting them , OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1479

giving them directions , OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1480

and keeping them in order . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1481

The Attorney_General - Marching them . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1482

Mr. Hatchell - Oh ! oh ! OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1483

The Attorney_General - When did Mr. O'Connell arrive ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1484

The day before : OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1485

he slept at Tullamoore . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1486

When were the arches erected ? OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1487

I think the first one was erected the night before ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1488

but the one opposite the chapel-gate was erected on the morning of the
meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1489

Mr. Henn - Be certain now , OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1490

and do@ @n't be giving us what you think . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1491

The Attorney_General - When was that arch erected ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1492

It was not there the night before ; OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1493

I think it was put there on the following morning , between nine and ten
o'clock . OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1494

What time was it that you saw the mottos on the erected arches ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1495

I began to go about the town after nine o'clock in the morning ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1496

and concluded , I think , about half-@ @past ten o'clock ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1497

but it is impossible to be accurate as to the moment .
OCONNELL-1844-2,196.1498

<P_197>

What hour did Mr. O'Connell and the others assemble on the platform ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1500

I have it down in my book about a quarter past two .
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1501

Where were you at the time , OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1502

or did you see any other of the traversers except Mr. O'Connell ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1503

I did ; OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1504

I saw that gentleman <paren> pointing to Mr. Steele <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1505

Did you see any one else ? OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1506

I saw Mr. O'Connell , OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1507

and I think I would know him . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1508

Mr. O'Connell - Here he is <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1509

The witness - I have no doubt at all but that is the man .
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1510

Did you see any one else ? OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1511

No , I did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1512

Where were you when Mr. O'Connell was speaking ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1513

In a store which overlooked the platform , about ten or twelve yards
from it ; OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1514

I never measured the distance . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1515

Did you hear any portion of his speech ? OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1516

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1517

Did you take down anything he said ? OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1518

I did ; OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1519

I took a short note of it . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1520

State any thing of which you are quite positive ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1521

The first thing he said was " That he came there from the centre of
Ireland to announce to them the certainty of Repeal .
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1522

He could prove from Peel and Wellington that Repeal was certain , " or
words to that effect <paren> a laugh <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1523

He likened Peel to a fool who came to a river and stood there to let the
waters flow past . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1524

He made some allusion to Lord Beaumont , OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1525

and called him " despicable Beaumont , " as far as I have it .
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1526

He alluded to a speech of Peel's , who said he would prefer a civil war
before he would grant Repeal ; OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1527

and he then said , " The better day , the better deed ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1528

let him make war on Ireland , OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1529

for he stood there to hurl his high and haughty defiance at him . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1530

I am not giving his exact words . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1531

He then said the people of Ireland should not be compelled to pay for a
church to which they did not belong . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1532

He alluded to the government or somebody giving them the ecclesiastical
establishment ; OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1533

but he said he would take it as an instalment .
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1534

I did not hear him say how much he would take <paren> loud laughter , in
which Mr. O'Connell heartily joined <$$font> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1535

I will take , he said , what I get , and make them give me the remainder
. OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1536

He then talked of the teetotallers , OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1537

and a great number of the people put up their hands .
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1538

He then said , {COM:missing_open_quote} I want to give you a pledge . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1539

And they all held up their hands . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1540

" If I want you wo@ @nt {COM:sic} I get you any day , or any hour . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1541

And they all cheered ; OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1542

but he added , " I@ @'ll take care I shall not want you . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1543

Mr. Hatchell - Just so . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1544

The witness continued - I could only hear him very indistinctly ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1545

in some parts he was totally inaudible . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1546

He then charged them not to give a vote for a Tory or anti-Repealer
<paren> a laugh . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1547

Did you make a calculation as to the number of persons present ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1548

I did ; OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1549

I should say there were about sixty or seventy_thousand persons present
, men , women , and children . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1550

Did you include in that number those who lived in the town of Tullamore
? OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1551

Not at all : OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1552

only those who came into the town . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1553

When did the meeting disperse ? OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1554

They did . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1557

You said there were nine bands present ? OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1558

Yes ; there were nine or ten bands present . OCONNELL-1844-2,197.1559

You are not a short-hand writer ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1566

No , I am not . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1567

How long were you in Tullamore before this ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1568

About two years and five months . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1569

You were apprised that the meeting was about to be held ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1570

Certainly . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1571

And you attended there as directed ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1572

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1573

And it was your duty to report what occurred ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1574

Yes ; I send every report to my superior officer of course .
OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1575

You said you were ten or twelve yards from Mr O'Connell when he was
speaking ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1576

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1577

He has got a loud voice - has he not ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1578

He has , OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1579

but I could not hear him . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1580

Did you hear him say anything at the meeting against Ribbonism ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1581

I think I did , OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1582

but at that moment I lost the whole thread of his discourse <paren>
laughter . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1583

Aye , so I thought ; OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1584

you lost the thread of the discourse when he began to speak of Ribbonism
? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1585

It was according as he spoke high or low that I heard him .
OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1586

Were there many persons attended that meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1587

Yes ; there were great numbers . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1588

And I believed it passed off peaceably , and did not require the
interference of the police ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1589

It could not have been more peaceable . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1590

There was neither riot nor turbulence ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1591

Neither . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1592

Do@ @n't you think that there was less cause for accidents than there
otherwise would have been by the great order that was observed by the
people in marching into town ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1593

I can@ @not positively say . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1594

I suppose you have been in the habit of attending large meetings ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1595

I never was at any so large . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1596

That is not the question I asked . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1597

I wanted to know if you had ever attended large meetings , such as fairs
, markets , or funerals ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1598

Any of the fairs or markets I have been at were nothing in comparison to
that meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1599

I did not ask you that . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1600

Be kind enough to answer such questions as I put to you .
OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1601

Did you never see horsemen attend a funeral in the same orderly manner
that was observed in going to that meeting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1602

I never did . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1603

When you went through the town the night before , are you quite sure you
saw those arches erected ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1604

I am not positive about it . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1605

Are you positive that you saw the words " Repeal , or the world in a
blaze " on one of the arches ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1606

I am quite positive . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1607

What time did you see that motto ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1608

About ten o'clock on Sunday morning . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1609

Did you see it taken down again ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1610

I did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1611

Will you swear that it was not taken down ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1612

I will not . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1613

Will you swear that Mr. Steele did not take it down ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1614

Did you see it from the platform ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1618

I did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1619

Will you swear that it was up when the meeting commenced ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1620

I will not . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1621

When did you see it last ? OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1622

I saw it on my return from walking through the town <paren> for the
purpose of taking a note of the mottos on the different arches ,
<$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1623

and I think it was about eleven o'clock . OCONNELL-1844-2,198.1624

<P_199>

When taking down the different mottos , I think you said you saw one
with " Patience , Perseverance ? " OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1626

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1627

Did you not observe also that there was an addition to it of " And
obedience to the laws ? " OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1628

I did not see that . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1629

You observed " Repeal " upon another arch , I believe ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1630

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1631

Did you observe that it was " Repeal " with the words to it , " But no
separation ? " OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1632

I did not see that . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1633

There were a great number of ladies in the town that day ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1634

I saw a great number of women there <paren> laughter . <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1635

Did you not see any ladies returning from church ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1636

I did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1637

Did you see any people at all returning from church ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1638

I did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1639

Did you see " God save the Queen " on another arch ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1640

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1641

Why did you not say so before ? OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1642

I did say so . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1643

The Attorney-General - He did say so on his direct examination .
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1644

Mr. Henn - Then I admit I was wrong . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1645

You know we are all liable to be mistaken occasionally .
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1646

Did you see " The Queen , God bless her , " amongst the different mottos
? OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1647

I did not see that . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1648

I wish to explain that there were a number of small mottoes on many of
the windows , which I did not take . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1649

Will you swear that you took down all the mottos publicly exhibited ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1650

I swear that I took down all that crossed the {TEXT:tbe} streets , or
appeared to form a part of the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1651

Did you take down all about the platform ? OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1652

I took down all that I could see ; OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1653

but am not possitive {TEXT:positive} that I saw them all .
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1654

Did you see one with the rose , shamrock , and thistle , and the words "
God save the Queen ? " OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1655

I did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1656

previous . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1660

And you sent in the return of your report two days afterwards ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1661

I sent in my report the next day . OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1662

Neal Browne , Esq. , examined by Mr Napier - OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1663

I am resident magistrate at Tullamore , OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1664

and I was resident there in the month of July last , the time of the
Repeal meeting ; OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1665

my house is in the main street ; OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1666

I saw the {TEXT:the_the} people coming into the town from the western or
Frankfort side of it ; OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1667

that was about one o'clock ; OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1668

they appeared to me to be coming in large bodies ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1669

I saw several bands of music {TEXT:mucic} in the town that day ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1670

there were some of them in before one o'clock ; OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1671

that was about the time that divine service was going on in the church ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1672

I remained from church for the purpose of being in readiness to attend
if called upon as magistrate ; OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1673

when the procession was formed it went down the street ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1674

turned to the left , again to the left , OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1675

and passed the church ; OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1676

that was , as I can recollect , about half-@ @past two o'clock ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1677

I saw Mr. O'Connell in the procession ; OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1678

I am not positive , OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1679

but I think Mr. Steele was sitting in his carriage -
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1680

I beg pardon , OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1681

I mean Mr. Steele , the gentleman whom I now see in the traversers' box
; OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1682

I was in the field at the rear {TEXT:rere} of my house when I heard the
music , OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1683

and I then ran into my house , OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1684

and when I got near the window the procession had passed by .
OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1685

I followed it into the street , OCONNELL-1844-2,199.1686

and when I came up I found that the people were <P_200> walking about
fifteen a-breast . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1687

After taking different turns through the streets , the procession went
to the Market-square , OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1688

and passed within about 150 and 200 yards from the base of the mound on
which the church is built . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1689

The music was then playing . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1690

I did not know what were the tunes . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1691

I met several persons coming from church through my own fields .
OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1692

That is not the usual way for them to go ; OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1693

but it is the one I usually take . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1694

There were about thirty-five or forty persons returning that way ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1695

I should think those who reside at the top of the town , and who
generally went to church by the back road , along which the procession
passed to the place of meeting , the Market-square .
OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1696

Three of the bands were in military uniform , with the exception that
they had no belts ; OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1697

and the Roscrea band had what are called scales , which are worn on the
shoulders of cavalry men . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1698

Another band wore caps , with a fall at the back of them .
OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1699

When I saw the people coming from the western side of the town , at
about one o'clock , there was a large body of horsemen , five a-breast ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1700

from the calculation I made , I should say about 240 in number .
OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1701

They preserved their order except in some few instances , where they
commingled with the crowd . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1702

Cross-examined by Mr. Moore . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1704

<$$heading>

I am resident magistrate at Tullamoore since the 26th of September ,
1839 . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1706

I have heard that it was usual for temperance bands to wear an uniform
dress . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1707

I heard so two years ago . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1708

That was long antecedent to the meeting at Tullamoore , but not long
before similar meetings . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1709

I heard the music playing , OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1710

but I did not know what were the tunes . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1711

I know Mr. Stuart , the last witness . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1712

On the day before the meeting I sent directions to him and to the county
inspector to attend the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1713

I returned from Dublin {TEXT:Dubln} , I think , on the 14th of July .
OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1714

On the 15th I gave instruction to these gentlemen , at first verbally ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1715

but I afterwards repeated it in writing . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1716

As I had received instructions myself I considered I was responsible .
OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1717

I did not go to the place of meeting , OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1718

nor can I state what was going on there . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1719

There was no riot or disturbance in the town till between eleven and
twelve o'clock at night . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1720

I did not hear that there was any at the meeting ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1721

but I have no doubt that there was no disturbance there , as there was
no report made to me of any . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1722

Re-examined by Mr. Napier - OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1723

On the 29th there was . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1734

Did you make any estimate of the numbers ? OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1735

I should say there were forty or fifty_thousand persons there on that
occasion . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1736

Were there persons on horseback ? OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1737

Yes ; many . OCONNELL-1844-2,200.1738

They had a kind of semi-uniform . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1749

Were there mottos on any of the banners ? OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1750

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1751

Did you take a note of any of them , OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1752

and if so what they were ? OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1753

There were on them , " Cead mille failthe ; " " Ireland for the Irish
and the Irish for Ireland ; " " Every man who commits a crime gives
strength the enemy ; " " Breathes there a man with soul so dead , who
never to himself hath said , ' This is my own my native land ' ? " "
Welcome , bright star of Erin ; " " A population of nine millions is too
great to be dragged at the tail of any other nation . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1754

Where were you situated when the persons were speaking on the platform ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1755

I was at the rear {TEXT:rere} of it . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1756

Were you there when the chair was taken ? OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1757

I was . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1758

Who was in the chair ? OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1763

They called him Count Nugent . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1764

Did you see Mr. O'Connell there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1765

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1766

I saw Mr. Steele there too , and several persons whom I did not know .
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1767

Read your note taken on that occasion . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1768

The chairman said " The Irish will get all they want if they attend to
their friends , OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1769

Ireland will be able to right herself . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1770

All should rally round the standard of Repeal . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1771

The next person who spoke was Priest O'Beirne : OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1772

he said , " This is no time to give a silent vote .
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1773

Ireland must rely upon herself ; OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1774

she must be raised to the condition of a nation .
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1775

The loyalty of Ireland is not the loyalty of expediency . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1776

He then inquired had the people any voice in the legislature ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1777

and several persons answered him with cries of " no , no . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1778

Was there great cheering ? OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1779

Yes , at the end of the proceedings there were three cheers for the
Queen , and three hearty {TEXT:harty} cheers for Repeal .
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1780

Did you hear a Mr. Carbery speak there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1781

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1782

Have you any note of what he said ? OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1783

Yes ; he said they ought to all join to crush England , and that that
year would bring a parliament to College-green , to legislate for
themselves , and make their population contented and happy .
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1784

Have you any note of what Mr. O'Connell said ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1785

I have some notes ; OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1786

he said . " I can tell you , ours is no vain cause .
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1787

Let there not be one ribbon society in the country ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1788

take no illegal oath . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1789

We are peaceable . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1790

Let them attack us , OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1791

and then " - . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1792

Here he made a pause OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1793

and continued - " Let Peel and Wellington give us acts of parliament if
they please , OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1794

we will find a way to drive a coach and six through them . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1795

Did Mr. O'Connell speak in the same tone of voice throughout ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1796

Yes , except the pause , which I can@ @not describe -
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1797

but it might be and seemed to be , understood by those who were
listening . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1798

He then said , " I will tell you what they will do ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1799

they will take the commission of the peace from your respective
supporters ; OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1800

but an Irish parliament , one of these days , will punish them in an
exemplary manner . " OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1801

He further said , " The temporalities of the church ought not to be
allocated to the church of the minority . OCONNELL-1844-2,201.1802

It was preposterous for one man to ask another to pay <P_202> for
{COM:"f"_is_aligned_with_following_line} his education .
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1803

I will tell you what repeal will do for you ; OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1804

it will give you fixity of tenure , OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1805

and I will explain to you what that is ; OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1806

it will prevent you from having a landlord who will not give you a
twenty-one year's lease . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1807

I say , give the landlord his right , but make him perform his duty .
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1808

I will tell you what the union has done for us ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1809

it has carried nine millions from the country , which might otherwise
have been spent in it . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1810

We will not continue under the domination of the Saxons .
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1811

We were never conquered . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1812

Ireland must be Irish . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1813

You will fight for repeal and liberty . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1814

Go home quietly now , OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1815

and tell your friends of this day's news , OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1816

and when I want you again I will let you know the day . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1817

Did Mr. Steele speak at the meeting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1818

He came forward with a large bundle of papers , which he said were
copies of an address to the people . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1819

They were for distribution ; OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1820

he said so : OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1821

but I did not see him give any away . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1822

<heading>

Cross_examined by Mr. Fitzgibbon . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1824

<$$heading>

Did you know the gentleman you have designated as Priest O'Beirne ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1826

No ; he was and is a stranger to me . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1827

Where were you standing ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1828

About fifteen yards in the rear {TEXT:rere} of the platform .
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1829

Then the backs of the speakers were turned towards you ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1830

They were , sir , OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1831

and I found a difficulty in taking down what was said .
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1832

I have no doubt . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1833

Did you write those notes at the time ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1834

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1835

They are the originals ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1836

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1837

Had you a table ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1838

I had a window stool . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1839

Was there any one with you at the time ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1840

Yes ; another head-constable named M'Guire . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1841

Is he here ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1842

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1843

How came you there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1844

We were sent on duty . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1845

Were you to take notes ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1846

Yes ; we were to take notes of what was material .
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1847

You said Mr. O'Connell made a pause ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1848

He did . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1849

A very significant pause , I presume ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1850

Yes , indeed . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1851

A sort of language known to the forty_thousand persons , but not to you
? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1852

They seemed to understand it - OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1853

it seemed to mean something which was not expressed <paren> laughter
<$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1854

Now turn your back , OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1855

and show the jury what kind of a pause it was that Mr. O'Connell made ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1856

Indeed I am not aware where the jury are . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1857

There they are <paren> pointing to the jury-box <$$paren> ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1858

now express the pause ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1859

Well , indeed , I can@ @not so successfully give expression to the pause
as Mr. O'Connell did <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1860

You did not see his face at the time of the pause ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1861

I saw him on the platform . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1862

Did you see his face ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1863

I may not have seen his face . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1864

I ask again {COM:missing_comma} did you see his face ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1865

I can@ @not recollect whether I saw his face or his back .
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1866

Then his face might have been turned towards you ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1867

It might . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1868

Was it necessary to send for you all the way from Sligo to tell us that
Mr. O'Connell's face might have been turned towards you -
OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1869

did you see his face ? OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1870

I think I did not see his face . OCONNELL-1844-2,202.1871

<P_203>

How long did this significant pause last ? OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1873

It may have lasted two {TEXT:missing_comma} three , four or five seconds
. OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1874

And did Mr. O'Connell make more than this one significant pause ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1875

Oh , yes ; he made several pauses ; but not such a pause as that which I
have mentioned . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1876

The pause , then , was one of three seconds - that which was the longest
and most significant ? OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1877

I did not state it was a three second's pause .
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1878

Of course he was saying nothing <paren> loud laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1879

Would you tell us what he said before this pause ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1880

now , sir , tell us ? OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1881

Indeed you press me , OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1882

and question me so rapidly that my memory does not serve me quickly
enough . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1883

Now , what was Mr. O'Connell saying before this pause ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1884

He asked if they were to submit to the Saxon and oppressor , and be
ground to the dust . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1885

He then paused <paren> said the witness <$$paren> ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1886

and then added , " But we are never to be conquered " -
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1887

that , sir , is the best imitation I can give of Mr. O'Connell's pause
<paren> laughter <$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1888

I fear we are putting you in a false position in asking you to imitate
Mr. O'Connell's manner <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1889

How long were you in Longford ? OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1890

I arrived on the night {TEXT:nigbt} of the 28th ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1891

and I left on the Tuesday morning ; OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1892

the meeting was held on the Sunday . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1893

Had you any riots there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1894

Oh , no , the people , by the advice of Mr. O'Connell , were very quiet
. OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1895

You were very sorry for that , I suppose ? OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1896

No , indeed ; I was very glad of it ; OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1897

I saw no breach of the peace . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1898

Did you see any tendency to a breach of the peace ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1899

The people came into the town in a very disorderly manner , shouting
very loud , and brandishing their sticks ; OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1900

of course they were not going to quarrel with each other .
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1901

Did you hear the testimony of the last witness ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1902

I did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1903

At what hour of the day did you see the people coming in in this way ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1904

There were large bodies of persons coming in from about ten o'clock
until two . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1905

Were they all that time shouting and brandishing their sticks ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1906

As they were coming in they did so ; OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1907

the people were in a sweating rage of excitement <paren> laughter
<$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1908

I thought you told us that the people took Mr. O'Connell's advice , and
were peaceable ? OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1909

But Mr. O'Connell had not addressed them at that time .
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1910

You said just now that the people were in a sweating rage of excitement
? OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1911

Mr. O'Connell did not hear them ; OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1912

they were led into that state of excitement by persons whom I believe to
be priests . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1913

Did you see any of those persons having sticks ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1914

I am not able to say whether I recollect their using sticks or not ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1915

I am not sure whether they were in the hands of the priests .
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1916

Are you not able to say whether the persons whom you state were priests
had sticks with them ? OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1917

My recollection does not enable me to {COM:missing_"to"} state
positively whether they had sticks or not . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1918

Are you able to swear whether they had or not ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1919

Certainly I will not swear it . OCONNELL-1844-2,203.1920

<P_204>

Did you see sticks in the hands of priests ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1922

My recollection will not serve me to say whether in the hands of persons
who appeared to be priests there were carried sticks .
OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1923

Did you know them to be priests ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1924

No ; except from the style of their dress . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1925

Did you see any one man on that day giving offence to any other man ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1926

I did not , I believe . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1927

Is that your answer , sir ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1928

If any such offence were given , I did not notice it .
OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1929

Did you see it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1930

I saw persons pulling each other off the platform ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1931

and there might have been some momentary anger .
OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1932

Did you see any momentary anger arise ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1933

I will not swear I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1934

Did you or did you not see it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1935

I may have seen it , OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1936

but I will not swear to it . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1937

On your oath did you see any anger there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1938

I will not swear there was . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1939

Did you see any breach of the peace ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1940

I saw no breach of the peace . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1941

The people were all of one opinion - to follow the advice of Mr
O'Connell and the other speakers ; OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1942

they were all of the same opinion , to do anything he pleased .
OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1943

But when did you see the brandishing of sticks , and hear the shouts ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1944

From ten to two . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1945

All that time ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1946

As they came in the priests brought them to the place where they were to
locate them . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1947

Were not all coming in from ten till two ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1948

Yes ; and before that time ; OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1949

they were coming in from nine o'clock . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1950

Were they coming in from nine o'clock shouting and brandishing their
sticks - OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1951

were they doing that all the time ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1952

They did not come in all at the same time ; OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1953

they came in in batches . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1954

Did you suppose that we conceived you to have said that they came in
simultaneously when you said they were four hours coming in ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1955

On your oath were they shouting for four or five hours ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1956

As they came in they were shouting . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1957

Were all those bodies of men shouting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1958

I did not say that all the bodies were . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1959

Was any body shouting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1960

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1961

Where were the police ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1962

Oh , at such meeting as that the police dare not show their face .
OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1963

You were there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1964

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1965

How were you there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1966

I was in plain clothes . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1967

Were you disguised ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1968

I was ordered on duty in plain clothes . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1969

How many of you went from Sligo ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1970

Two . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1971

Two only ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1972

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1973

In what part of the town was the shouting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1974

It may have been in several parts . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1975

I beg of you , sir , not to give me such an answer as that .
OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1976

We do not want you to come from Sligo to tell us what may have been ,
but what has been . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1977

In what part of the town did you see the people jumping , and
brandishing their sticks , and shouting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1978

Somewhere about the middle of the street where I was ; in the centre of
the town , near the market . OCONNELL-1844-2,204.1979

<P_205>

What is Needham ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1981

A person in business . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1982

What business ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1983

<paren> witness here paused . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1984

A mighty pause ! OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1985

I believe he is something in the business of a chandler .
OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1986

Have you a nose ? - OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1987

are you not sure he was a chandler , if he were a chandler ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1988

What street was it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1989

I do not know the name of it . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1990

Was it in the main-street ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1991

Where the meeting was held there is a junction of three roads , the
canal road , the Dublin coach road , and - . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1992

Did you hear the shouting and see the brandishing of sticks while you
were in Needham's house ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1993

I did , several times . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1994

Will you name the hours at which you saw this ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1995

From about ten o'clock until about two , when Mr. O'Connell was there .
OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1996

There were occasional displays of the mob leaping on the grouud , waving
{TEXT:waiving} their sticks , hallooing , and shouting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1997

How often were those displays made ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1998

I can@ @not be positive . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.1999

Were they many times ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2000

Many times . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2001

They extended over the whole of that time , OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2002

and there were no policeman walking up and down ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2003

I saw no policeman there . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2004

On your oath did you see a policeman walking up and down ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2005

None , from the time the meeting was gathered ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2006

I swear I did not see a policeman from eight till ten .
OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2007

Did you see one after ten ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2008

I may have seen one after ten . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2009

Was there loud shouting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2010

There was {COM:missing_period} OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2011

Every one must have heard it as well as you ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2012

Yes , every one within the possibility of hearing the shouting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2013

That is where you were ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2014

Yes , any one who had the use of his ears might have heard it .
OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2015

Must not the waiving {TEXT:waving} of sticks have been visible to others
as well as you ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2016

Yes , to every one in the same position . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2017

It was a very remarkable thing ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2018

Decidedly . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2019

You saw no policeman from eight till ten ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2020

OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2023

Yes , some of them may have had arms . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2026

Now , can@ @not you answer me positively , without using the word " may

Did you see a policeman armed that day ? OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2029

Some of them may have been armed <paren> much laughter <$$paren> .

Were they in their barracks that day , or about the town ?

I do not know . OCONNELL-1844-2,205.2036

Now you were asked did you see Mr. O'Connell's pause -

do you know what Mr. O'Connell's <font> paws <$$font> are ?

I may have heard of the people being made cats'-paws of <paren> a laugh

Mr. Fitzgibbon - And that is an observation originally made by one of

Mr. Bennett - If you can induce the gentlemen about you not to talk so
loud , the witness can be heard . OCONNELL-1844-2,206.2071

Mr. Fitzgibbon - And I tell you there are not .
OCONNELL-1844-2,206.2074

Mr. Bennett - I did not refer to you at all , Mr. Fitzgibbon .
OCONNELL-1844-2,206.2075

Mr. Ford - I was merely making a suggestion to Mr. Hatchell .
OCONNELL-1844-2,206.2076

Mr. Bennett - Then you were doing the very thing I objected to <paren>
a laugh <$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,206.2077

OCONNELL-1844-2,206.2079

Did the people follow these bands through the town ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,206.2090

They did . OCONNELL-1844-2,206.2091

Can you form any estimate of the number of persons who were present

To the best of my opinion , there were from forty to fifty_thousand
persons assembled on that occasion . OCONNELL-1844-2,207.2093

Was there any persons leading the people as they were coming into town ?

I saw the people coming in in a kind of military order , led by a person
whom , to the best of my belief , was a Roman_Catholic Priest .
OCONNELL-1844-2,207.2095

What do you mean by military order ? OCONNELL-1844-2,207.2096

I mean that they walked in regular order , in rank and file .

I took notes of the mottos and banners ; OCONNELL-1844-2,207.2135

but High Constable Johnson was with me , OCONNELL-1844-2,207.2136

and as we could not conveniently take notes of the proceedings together
he took notes by my directions . OCONNELL-1844-2,207.2137

In other parts of the town I saw - " Nine millions of people are too
great to be dragged at the tail of any other nation . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,207.2143

It was on a large piece of calico or linen on the Dublin road .
OCONNELL-1844-2,207.2144

At what time did you see that motto ? OCONNELL-1844-2,207.2145

Did you pass that road before the meeting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,207.2147

" He who commits a crime gives strength to the enemy . "

Are you sure the word enemy was there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2152

Yes , quite sure , OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2153

There was also the words <font> " Cead mille failthe " <$$font> in
another place . OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2154

Did you hear Mr. O'Connell's speech on that occasion ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2155

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2156

Would you mention any parts of the speech which you may happen to
recollect ? OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2157

He said " This was no vain cause . " OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2158

Did you hear Mr. O'Connell say anything about trial by jury and the
administration of justice ? OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2159

I have no distinct recollection of the words he used ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2160

but on the day after the meeting I read - OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2161

Mr. Hatchell - No one has anything to do , sir , with what you read .
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2162

Mr. Bennett - I do not ask what you read , but what you recollect .
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2163

The witness was again about to proceed , when he was interrupted by
Judge Perrin - OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2164

Are you now about to speak from your own memory , or from what you read
in the newspapers ? OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2165

Mr. Bennett - Tell only what you recollect yourself .
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2166

Witness - Mr. O'Connell said , to the best of my memory , " They take
the commission of the peace from your respected supporters . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2167

Mr. Bennett - Do you recollect anything else he said ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2168

His concluding sentence was : - " Go home quietly {TEXT:quitely} ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2169

and tell your friends what you have heard here today , and to be ready
to come when I want them again . " OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2170

When the people were coming in did you see any stick with them ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2171

I saw some people brandishing sticks as they were coming in .
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2172

After Mr. O'Connell had made his speech did you see any brandishing of
sticks ? OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2173

The witness , as well as we could hear his answer , said he did not
observe any . OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2174

Mr. Fitzgibbon - I appeal to the court whether that question was put in
a legal way or not . OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2175

Judge Perrin - The question has been answered , OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2176

and what harm has been done ? OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2177

Mr. Fitzgibbon - It has turned out , my lord , that the answer could do
us no harm , OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2178

but that does not prevent the question put by Mr. Bennett from being
illegal . OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2179

Mr. Bennett - It is for the court to say whether the question be legal
or not , OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2180

but you have no right , sir , to decide , or to pronounce that my
question was illegal . OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2181

I insist that I was right in putting the question ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2182

and I adhere to my right . OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2183

Mr. Bennett <paren> to witness <$$paren> - After the speeches what did
the people do ? OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2184

They all dispersed quietly after the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2185

Do you happen to know where the bands came from ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2186

The persons in the house where I was - OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2187

Mr. Hatchell - You are not to tell what you do not know yourself ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2188

Then I do not know where the bands came from of my own knowledge .
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2189

Chief_Justice - Did you say how many persons attended the meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,208.2190

Did you see a report of his evidence in this morning's papers ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2209

No , I did not ; OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2210

Have you been in the army yourself ? OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2212

Never . OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2213

You appear to have been posted in some house near the platform , for the
purpose of making observations ? OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2214

Yes ; I got into a house which was convenient to the platform .
OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2215

Nor any tendency to it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2220

I saw no breach of the peace committed . OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2221

Upon your oath , sir , is that an answer to my question ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2222

why did you evade the last question I put to you ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2223

I wish to ask you fairly about what you saw , OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2224

and I expect you@ @'ll answer me candidly , OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2225

If you do not , we must proceed differently , and act reciprocally ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2226

I desire to answer candidly . OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2227

You must answer me candidly . OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2228

I take for granted you are not a Repealer , <font> Captain <$$font>
Maguire ? <paren> a laugh . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2229

Mr. Bennett - That is a fair answer . OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2231

He belongs to no class of politicians . OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2232

Mr. Hatchell - Well , not having seen a breach of the peace , or a
tendency thereto , " Othello's occupation was gone " - was@ @n't that it

We did not go there to preserve the peace , OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2234

we went there to make observations . OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2235

That is the first object of a good general , you know , to make his
observations of the enemy and see how the land lies ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2236

We were desired to make our observations . OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2237

Are you not under the control of the sub-inspector ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,209.2238

You were not sent there to preserve the peace , but to make observations

Did they brandish them angrily coming into Longford ?

I did not see them do any of these things . OCONNELL-1844-2,210.2268

OCONNELL-1844-2,210.2269

Did they halt ? <paren> a laugh . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,210.2271

They halted at the platform . OCONNELL-1844-2,210.2276

That was because they could go no further , I suppose ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,210.2277

I suppose so . OCONNELL-1844-2,210.2278

Did they stand at ease ? <paren> laughter . <$$paren>

OCONNELL-1844-2,210.2295

Mr. Bennett {TEXT:Bennet} suggested that the witness should wait
{TEXT:waite} until the noise ceased in the court before he gave his
answer , as it was impossible to hear what he said in consequence of the

The witness hesitated , OCONNELL-1844-2,210.2311

and gave no answer . OCONNELL-1844-2,210.2312

There is a man who read Dundas <paren> laughter <$$paren> .

What I did hear I can state with certainty : OCONNELL-1844-2,212.2445

before I got to the platform I was told that he had been occupied in
reading an address ; OCONNELL-1844-2,212.2446

he then said he came there to tell them a secret , and he thought there
was enough of them there to keep it ; OCONNELL-1844-2,212.2447

he said the union should be repealed in some time or other that I can@
@not {TEXT:cannnot} recollect <paren> laughter <$$paren> ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,212.2448

he named the time , OCONNELL-1844-2,212.2449

he then said we should have Ireland for the Irish .
OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2451

They might have England for the English , and Scotland for the Scotch ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2452

OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2453

He also said that they were too determined and too temperate for it to
be kept from them . OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2454

brides on the earth , OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2455

and he then proved it by some authority . OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2456

He asked them did they ever hear tell of the man with the ugly name ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2457

it was Sugden , OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2458

and he would not call a pig by such a name ; OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2459

and as for the lord lieutenant , he was so ignorant that he sent a
commission to Kilkenny to inquire if it was a seaport !
OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2460

What followed ? OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2461

In alluding to the police , he said , that having seen some members of
it among the crowd , he would , if they were afraid of any riot get his
own friends to preserve the peace . OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2462

He also said that the soldiery had been sent among them to shoot them ,
but that they knew a trick worth two of that ; and if they were attacked
they would defend themselves . OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2463

He said that the serjeants of the English army were the finest body of

and he said that the repeal of the union would make the day-labourerers
farmers , the farmers gentlemen , and the gentlemen members of
parliament <paren> laughter . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2471

He asked the people would they be ready to come again if they were
required by him , and to hold up their hands if they would .
OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2472

What happened then ? OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2473

How long did that meeting last ? OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2479

I think not more than two hours . OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2480

During the meeting did you observe anything particular ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2481

What attracted my attention most before the commencement of the meeting
was , that a person on the platform called out to others in the crowd to
remove a man who he said was an enemy . OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2482

That individual refused to go away , OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2483

and the people were then called on to cut the reins and to remove him .
OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2484

I can@ @not exactly say if the party referred to was on horseback in
consequence of the position in which I was placed ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,213.2485

but from the word reins I infer that he was on horseback .

That was immediately before Mr. O'Connell's arrival .

I may , however ; OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2525

but I can@ @not bear it in mind . OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2526

Was it in consequence of any instructions you received that you attended

I was ordered to attend , OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2528

OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2542

And at about eleven o'clock you undressed ? OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2543

No ; the procession was going through the town when I took off my
uniform . OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2544

What time did you leave the streets for the purpose of undressing ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2545

I can@ @not be particular as to the hour ; OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2546

I was , with about a_hundred policemen , in the barrack square ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2547

and it was there I undressed . OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2548

Oh , I have a curiosity to know the precise time .
OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2549

You know you have been particular as to the words of Mr. O'Connell ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2550

and you must be equally so as to the time of your undressing ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2551

might it have been one or four o'clock ? OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2552

I can@ @not state exactly ; OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2553

I think it was between one and two . OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2554

Where did you walk in your police uniform ? OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2555

I walked about the streets of the town . OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2556

How much of the procession did you see pass ? OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2557

I think about one-@ @half of it . OCONNELL-1844-2,214.2558

<P_215>

Was it the former or latter half of it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2560

The latter half of it ; OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2561

I was in the police station , OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2562

and saw it go out of the town of Mallow . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2563

Are you a military man ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2564

No , I am in the constabulary . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2565

Oh , I see ; OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2566

you have fought no battle ; OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2567

your's have been all civic honours <paren> laughter <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2568

I think you stated that the procession marched in regular order , the
bands playing and banners flying ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2569

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2570

Did you take a note of that at the time ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2571

I did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2572

Then you spoke from the impression made on your mind ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2573

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2574

Now , when you saw this great and imposing array marching in procession
, may I ask were you afraid ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2575

Oh , not at all . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2576

Was the procession what is called a close column ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2577

They marched four deep . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2578

Probably you can tell me what tunes were played by the bands ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2579

I can@ @not . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2580

Well , now , on this subject too I have a great curiosity ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2581

and I would be glad to know from you whether it was Paddy Carey , or
Paddy from Cork that was played . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2582

I can@ @not tell . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2583

Will you swear that it might not have been God save the Queen ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2584

I will not swear as to the tunes that were played .
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2585

Is your ear so dull to all impressions of sweet sound and soft music ,
as to leave no impression upon it <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2586

Are you a native of Cork ? {TEXT:.} OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2587

I am not . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2588

Was the procession a military or a civil one ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2589

The people were quite civil . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2590

There we quite agree . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2591

Did you wait until it had all passed ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2592

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2593

And you then went to the place of meeting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2594

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2595

I am not asking you if anything particularly wicked was said or done
there ; because if there was I am sure it was brought out by the
gentlemen at the other side ; OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2596

but I think you said that the horses appeared in regular order .
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2597

Am I to understand that they had been well fed ; that they were fat and
well groomed <paren> laughter <$$paren> ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2598

I did not observe that they were fat or otherwise ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2599

I spoke of the order in which they proceeded . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2600

Where were the canon and the musketry , OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2601

or what became of the dead and wounded <paren> continued laughter
<$$paren> ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2602

I did not observe any canon or musketry with the people ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2603

and I did not see any one killed or wounded . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2604

You said that the horses went in regular order ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2605

I said that the horses went five or six abreast ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2606

and that I call regular order . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2607

Were there any ladies there , and children ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2608

I saw several women and children present . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2609

Did they charge you , OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2610

or did you charge them <paren> laughter <$$paren> ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2611

They did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2612

I believe the women came to the meeting principally on pillions behind
their husbands ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2613

A good many of them came so . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2614

Had the women their arms round the men ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2615

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2616

Do you think that was an offence against the arms act <paren> laughter
<$$paren> ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2617

I do@ @n't know that ; OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2618

I do@ @n't know the law . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2619

Were there any Cork women there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2620

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2621

The Cork women are handsome , are they not ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2622

Why , yes , they are . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2623

Then , you had an eye to the handsome women ? OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2624

I liked to look at them . OCONNELL-1844-2,215.2625

<P_216>

Then , there were banners firing , horseman marching , women joking ,
and children laughing at the fun ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2627

I do@ @n't think there were any children in it ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2628

they would be too much pressed by the crowd . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2629

Were there temperance bands there ; or timperance
{COM:font_change_around_"tim"} - OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2630

perhaps you understand it better ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2631

I do not understand timperance . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2632

On your oath , you do@ @n't understand timperanoe ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2633

No <paren> laughter . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2634

Were there temperance bands there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2635

There might be . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2636

On your oath whether do you think it better to be playing music , or
drinking bad whiskey ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2637

Oh , certainly better to have the music . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2638

Then if the people play music they are to be prosecuted ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2639

and if they drink whiskey they are to be prosecuted ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2640

do@ @n't you think that is too bad ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2641

I can@ @not judge of that . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2642

Did you see during the day anything done but music played , or hear
anything but some pleasant speeches , eh ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2643

I have seen what I have stated , but no more . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2644

Did you make any report of what was said by any of the speakers ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2645

No , I took no report . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2646

Then you speak from memory ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2647

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2648

Did you take a refresher that day , that is , did you make yourself
comfortable ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2649

I was not thinking about that so much . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2650

Come now to Mr. O'Connell's speech , OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2651

and tell me why you went to hear it when you took no note of it ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2652

I had a wish to hear the great counsellor speak <paren> laughter .
<$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2653

Then if you have a wish to hear another great counsellor speak , wait
till you hear Mr. Hatchell <paren> laughter . <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2654

Now tell me about the pause in Mr. O'Connell's speech ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2655

it seemed significant in the eyes of a policeman - eh , did it ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2656

No , I can@ @not say it did . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2657

What do you think ought to be the punishment for a pause -
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2658

transportation , I suppose ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2659

Oh no , I would not say that . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2660

Would you have a wish to hear a great orator who never pauses ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2661

if you have , wait till you hear Mr. M=c=Donagh <paren> loud laughter .
<$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2662

Do you know a gentleman who was examined here yesterday , named Johnson
? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2663

I have seen him here . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2664

Do you know that he too gave evidence about a pause , a significant
pause ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2665

No , I do not know that he said anything about it .
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2666

Tell us , again , exactly at what particular word the pause was made ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2667

It was at the word armed . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2668

Well , then , he said with Repeal cards ! OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2669

Armed with Repeal cards ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2670

Yes , with Repeal cards <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2671

Did you nudge the fellow next you when you heard the word armed used ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2672

Oh , yes , I did ; OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2673

I nudged him to get on out of my way <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2674

Did he not say something about the serjeants in France ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2675

Yes , he said that serjeants were promoted to be officers .
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2676

Did that tickle your fancy ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2677

No , not in the least . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2678

Were you not glad to hear of serjeants being promoted .
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2679

Did you not prick up your ears at hearing of serjeants becoming an
officer ; a meritorious , active , useful serjeant ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2680

No I did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2681

On your oath do@ @n't you fully aspire to the just promotion to which
your merits entitles you ? OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2682

Yes , I do , OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2683

why not ; OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2684

but it is for the inspector-general to judge of that .
OCONNELL-1844-2,216.2685

<P_217>

Then , do@ @n't you think that it would be a reasonable expectation that
you should not always remain a serjeant ; but that you should , in
course of time , be promoted to the rank of sub-inspector ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2687

I would think that a very reasonable expectation .
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2688

Then you would be raised to the rank of a gentleman ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2689

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2690

Are you a Repealer ? OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2691

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2692

Why not , as you would , when Repeal comes , be elevated to the rank of
lord . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2693

You know Mr. O'Connell said that all the gentlemen would be lords ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2694

now , what title do you think you ought to get ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2695

I do not know that . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2696

Do you not think that Lord Ballincollig would suit you ? <paren> loud
laughter <$$paren> , OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2697

Now a little more about the pause ; OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2698

on your oath , whether do you think it was sedition , treason ,
conspiracy , or flat burglary ? <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2699

Give us your opinion ? OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2700

I can@ @not tell what it meant . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2701

Now were you joking when you told us about the house ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2702

I never joke when on my oath . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2703

You say you heard some country fellow on the platform tell some one
{COM:semantics_of_pseudo-imperative_but_nonfinite} to go out of the
crowd , or if he did not his throat ought to be cut ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2704

I did hear that . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2705

Can you tell what the fellow was doing in the crowd ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2706

I did not see him at all . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2707

Can you tell whether he was on horseback , or had a cart in amongst the
people ? OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2708

I can@ @not tell . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2709

Are not these bad times for policemen down in the county Cork ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2710

no rows , OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2711

no breach of the peace , OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2712

all quiet , OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2713

nothing doing ? OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2714

It is odd enough , OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2715

the less I get to do the better I like it <paren> laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2716

Did not you tell us you never joked when on you oath ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2717

That is no joke <paren> continued laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2718

Well , then , you have not much to do in the south of Ireland ; not much
pressed for business ? OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2719

Pretty well pressed that day . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2720

There again you forget what you said about not joking on your oath ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2721

I am not joking now either . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2722

Well , then , was it by ladies or gentlemen you were pressed that day ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2723

I do@ @n't think that either were in it . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2724

Well , then , were there any of the pretty Cork girls in the crowd that
you pressed into a corner ? OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2725

There was no corner in it ; OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2726

I was amongst the great body of the people . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2727

Well , there were some pretty country girls there very near you ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2728

Oh , there were of course . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2729

You lost no limb or arm that day ; or even a bit of your whisker ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2730

No ; there was no fighting in it . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2731

Was your whisker even ruffled ? OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2732

I can@ @not say it was . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2733

Where did you dine that day ? OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2734

Indeed I forget . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2735

Perhaps it was because the dinner was not a good one ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2736

Very likely . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2737

Where did you sleep that night ? OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2738

I do not remember now . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2739

Did you get a comfortable bed to repose upon after the day's hard toil ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2740

Indeed I think the bed was rather a hard one . OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2741

Did you bear in mind all that occurred on that eventful day ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2742

or did you think no more about it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2743

Why , I thought no more about it at that time .
OCONNELL-1844-2,217.2744

<P_218>

When then were you applied to by that grave_looking gentleman opposite
<paren> Mr. Kemmis <$$paren> , to be a witness ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2746

In the month of December last . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2747

Then you thought nothing about the great day at Mallow , from June until
December , when Mr. Kemmis found you out ? OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2748

No ; I can@ @not say I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2749

Were there not several respectable persons who reside in Mallow , who
went to see the meeting that day ? OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2750

Of course there were . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2751

There are Whigs and Tories in that town who saw the meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2752

Yes ; of course . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2753

People of property and station resident in the neighbourhood ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2754

Yes ; I suppose so . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2755

Are there any of them here to-day as witnesses ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2756

I can@ @not tell . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2757

Well , all you can say may be summed up into this , that you paid a
flying visit there . You were pressed by the ladies ; you observed a
pause in O'Connell's speech ; OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2758

so I will pause here , when by wishing sincerely that you may get the
promotion you so truly merit , you may go down .
OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2759

Re-examined by Mr. Brewster . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2761

<$$heading>

Where was Mr. Anderson during the meeting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2763

For a while he was in the barrack-square . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2764

Was that nearer the meeting than you were ? OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2765

No ; OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2766

for a part of the time he was in the court-house .
OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2767

Mr. Whiteside objected to that line of cross-examination -
OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2768

where Mr. Anderson was , or what instructions were given him did not
affect the traversers . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2769

Mr. Brewster {TEXT:Brewester} - I merely want the fact , where Mr.
Anderson was placed . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2770

Was he nearer the speakers than you were ? OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2771

No ; he was twenty or thirty yards from the speakers ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2772

and from his position he could not hear well . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2773

Henry Godfrey was the next called , OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2774

and was examined by Mr. Freeman . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2775

You are a constable , OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2776

and were so in August last ? OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2777

Yes sir . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2778

Do you remember the 6th of August last , OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2779

Well , sir . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2780

Where were you on that day ? OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2781

At Baltinglass . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2782

Were you stationed there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2783

No , I was stationed at Glenard , about eight miles off from Baltinglass

Were you ordered to Baltinglass on that day ? OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2785

I was . OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2786

Were you there in the evening or in the morning ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,218.2787

day ? OCONNELL-1844-2,222.3045

Counsel here repeated the question . - OCONNELL-1844-2,222.3046

<bracket> No answer . <$$bracket> OCONNELL-1844-2,222.3047

On your oath , do you mean to tell the jury that you did not make that
note in your hand on the day of meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,222.3048

<bracket> After some delay <$$bracket> - I do not understand you .
OCONNELL-1844-2,222.3049

Now , do you believe that my question was about the paper you have in
your hand , or about a paper which I had not seen .
OCONNELL-1844-2,222.3050

I asked you - did you not tell the jury that you made the note at the
time ? OCONNELL-1844-2,222.3051

I can@ @not answer your question , OCONNELL-1844-2,222.3052

for I do not understand you . OCONNELL-1844-2,222.3053

Where is the note you made that day , if you made any ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,222.3054

I wrote this from my notes . OCONNELL-1844-2,222.3055

<P_223>

Where are the notes you made ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3057

The Solicitor_General interfered , OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3058

and said Mr. Fitzgibbon was not acting fairly towards the witness ,
part of his answers not being heard , from the rapidity with which he
put the question . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3059

Mr. Fitzgibbon - Mr. Solicitor_General , do not say that I am not
acting fairly towards the witness . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3060

The Solicitor_General - You interrupt his answers .
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3061

Mr. Fitzgibbon - I beg your pardon ; OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3062

I do not interrupt him . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3063

I will take issue upon that <paren> a laugh <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3064

The Solicitor_General - It is hardly fair to the witness to keep back a
part of his answers . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3065

Mr. Fitzgibbon - I do@ @n't want to prevent a single word of his
answers going to the jury . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3066

Now , witness , answer me . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3067

Where is the note you wrote this from ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3068

I think it was burned . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3069

I see , OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3070

dead men tell no tales . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3071

When did you burn them ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3072

When I went home after the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3073

When was that ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3074

After I gave in my report , I compared it with the notes ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3075

and saw it was correct . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3076

When did you compare it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3077

I sent in my report the morning after the meeting . {TEXT:,}
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3078

Now , did you not speak of a few days ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3079

I compared it at the time I wrote my report , OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3080

and then when I went home , lest I should have made any mistake , I
compared it again . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3081

Were you ordered to take notes of what occurred at the meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3082

<bracket> A pause <$$bracket> . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3083

I am giving you time enough to answer the question .
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3084

Question repeated . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3085

I received orders from my sub-inspector . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3086

Some of them were very long , OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3087

and I do@ @n't recollect them at all . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3088

Is that an answer ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3089

Mr. Bennett - It is impossible for the witness to give answers to those
questions . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3090

You put an end to them before he has time to answer them , by asking
another . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3091

Mr. Fitzgibbon denied that he interrupted the witness's answers .
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3092

Were you ordered to take notes of this meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3093

I was ordered to take notice of any particular statements .
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3094

Did you mistake my words and suppose I meant " notice ? "
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3095

I do@ @n't {TEXT:don'} recollect being ordered to take notes .
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3096

Is that true that you went on one side to make these notes .
OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3097

Look at the jury , OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3098

and tell me whether you mean to say that you went on one side of the
road ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3099

No , I went down away from the crowd . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3100

On the side of the road ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3101

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3102

Inside the ditch ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3103

No , outside the ditch . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3104

Was there not a great crowd there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3105

No ; the crowd was not so great there . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3106

What time was it ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3107

Before Mr. O'Connell came out ; OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3108

there were some people waiting in the ditches till Mr. O'Connell came
out . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3109

Had you a pen ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3110

I had a pencil . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3111

And a book ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3112

No ; a piece of paper . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3113

Then you went prepared to take notes ? OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3114

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,223.3115

<P_224>

Will you repeat the expressions again for me ? OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3117

" This is the day that will frighten Saunders . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3118

Is that what was said ? OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3119

Something to that effect . OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3120

Read what is on your note ? OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3121

I heard several people say " This is the day that will frighten Saunders
; " OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3122

I heard words to that effect from several . OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3123

I heard others say , " This is the day that will frighten him ; "
OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3124

some said " Devils cure to him , OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3125

he would not allow them to join the repeal . " OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3126

Have you any note of that ? OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3127

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3128

Are you not after telling the jury that you made a note of the
proceedings on the spot ? OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3129

I made a memorandum from which I took my report .
OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3130

And the original note or memorandum you say you burnt ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3131

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3132

Now is the book in your hand the same as the reprint which you sent into
your office ? OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3133

I can@ @not say that it is exactly the same . OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3134

Mr. Freeman - This is the report which the witness sent into the office
, OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3135

and I submit , my lord , that Mr. Fitzgibbon has {TEXT:has,} no right
to ask the witness any question relating to the contents of that
document without placing it in his hands . OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3136

A witness can no more be required to swear to the contents of a paper in
his cross-examination than in his direct examination , without having
the paper put into his hands . OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3137

I , therefore , contend that the witness in the present instance has a
right to have this report in his hands before he answers Mr. Fitzgibbon
. OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3138

Mr. Fitzgibbon - I merely asked the witness if the report which he
delivered in was the same as that which he had in his book , and not
what was in it or not in it . OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3139

I asked him as to how he made it out ; whether the report was made out
from the book or the book from the report . OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3140

And the rule in the case being founded on a plain principle of reason ,
as it ought to be is simply such , because , as the accuracy of the
witnesss may be defective , it is not to be taxed too much , his
examination being a trial of his veracity and not of his memory .
OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3141

There is a total misunderstanding of my question on the other side .
OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3142

The Attorney_General - There is not the slightest misunderstanding of
Mr. Fitzgibbon's question on our part , OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3143

and with great submission I contend that his question is utterly illegal
. OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3144

In the Queen's case it was decided that the witness could not be
examined on the contents of a paper , without having the paper in his
hands , OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3145

and I contend that the question put by Mr. Fitzgibbon is tantamount to
one about the contents of the paper ; OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3146

and I am resolved to have the opinion of the court as to its illegality
. OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3147

Mr. Fitzgibbon - That was not the question which I put .
OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3148

Judge Crampton - The shortest way , Mr. Fitzgibbon , would be for you
to put your question over again . OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3149

Mr. Fitzgibbon <paren> to the witness <$$paren> - Now , without looking
at the papers in your hands , tell the jury whether you copied the book
in your hands from the report , or the report from the book ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3150

I copied the report from my notes , and the book from the report ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3151

but I can@ @not say they are exactly the same .
OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3152

Did you copy the book from the report before you sent the report into
the office ? OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3153

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,224.3154

<P_225>

Are you quite sure of that ? OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3156

I copied the report from the notes , OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3157

and before I sent it in , I made a copy of it which I brought home with
me to the station , OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3158

and I coppied {TEXT:copied} the book from that .
OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3159

What became of that copy which you brought home with you ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3160

I dare say it is at home . OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3161

Are you quite sure that you have not it with you ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3162

<paren> Witness searched his pockets , OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3163

and produced the copy of the report . <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3164

Have you the expression , " The devil's cure to Saunders , " in that
report ? OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3165

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3166

Why , you have not read it to try ; OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3167

do@ @n't you think it worth your while to look into your report , to try
whether it contains that expression ? OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3168

I know it is not in it . OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3169

Where did you write out the report ? OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3170

In a house at Baltinglass . OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3171

In what house ? OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3172

It was a carpenter's house . OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3173

What was the carpenter's name ? OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3174

I do@ @n't recollect . OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3175

but afterwards I saw another gentleman take the chair .
OCONNELL-1844-2,225.3208

Who also were on the platform ? OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3298

Father Lalor , of Baltinglass ; Mr. Steele , the Rev Mr. Murtagh , of
Kilcullen , and others . OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3299

Did you hear the speeches made ? OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3300

I heard Mr. O'Connell tell the people he was glad to see them all there
, and hoped to see them in the same place when they@ @'d come again
<paren> laughter <$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3301

Did they say anything to that ? OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3302

Yes ; they all shouted <paren> a laugh <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3303

After the meeting was over did you see them go away ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3304

They went towards Baltinglass , across the bridge , and in the direction
of the barrack . OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3305

As you were going over the bridge did you hear {TEXT:here} the people
say anything ? OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3306

Mr. Moore - Does your lordship think that is evidence to affect the
traversers . OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3307

The meeting was held , OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3308

the people were going away , OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3309

and to seek after that to give a character to the meeting from
expressions used by well-known individuals is decidedly no evidence .
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3310

Mr. Tomb replied that it was such expressions which gave a character to
, and proved what the intentions of the meeting really were .
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3311

Mr. Moore - The only evidence given is what was said by some persons
unknown in a field ; OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3312

and they were not certainly calculated to give it any effect whatever .
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3313

The Chief_Justice - We can@ @not exclude the evidence ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3314

but it is not of much consequence one way or another .
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3315

Examination resumed - OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3316

I was obliged to stop on the bridge the crowds were so great .
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3317

I then got into a field where I heard one man say , " Repeal is certain
. " OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3318

" Yes , " said another , " if we do not get it we will fight for it . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3319

" Aye , " said a third , " we will turn out for it . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3320

Mr. Moore submitted that the traversers could not be affected by what
any individual might choose to say after the meeting was dispersed .
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3321

The court had already ruled that a party of men going to a meeting with
banners , was admissible evidence to explain what its meaning and
intention was ; OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3322

but it would , he contended , be going to a very dangerous length indeed
, and one , in his mind , unknown to the law , to make the traversers
accountable for the conversations of unknown individuals going home
perhaps , or , at all events , found together by a policeman in a field
a long distance from the place of meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3323

If that were once admitted by a court of law as legal evidence , there
was no man in the community safe from being implicated in the commission
of crimes and offences of which he may be totally innocent .
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3324

Mr. Hatchell - If such conversation had occurred before the meeting was
held , and with the knowledge of the traversers , then an opportunity
would have been afforded them of withdrawing themselves ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3325

but after it was held tranquilly , and peaceably , and laudably , it
would be monstrous to hold that any language , or misconduct , or
declaration of others , who were not there , although coming from the
same direction , could be held as evidence , or be allowed to affect the
character , or property , or perhaps the lives of innocent individuals .
OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3326

Mr. Tomb - Perhaps I may adopt an expedient which may raise the
question properly for argument , by asking the distance from the bridge
to the platform , and how long after the meeting had dispersed the
conversation took place ? OCONNELL-1844-2,227.3327

<P_228>

To the Witness - What was the distance from the bridge to the platform ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3329

Not half a mile . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3330

How long after the meeting did you hear the conversation ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3331

Not an hour after . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3332

Mr. Moore Really , my lords , this is too bad .
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3333

Mr. Tomb - Was there a separation of the crowd ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3334

Mr. Moore objected to this question being answered .
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3335

Mr. Tomb submitted the question was a proper and legal one .
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3336

He wished to show the effect produced by the meeting held , and the
speeches made by the different speakers , which he contended he had a
perfectly legal right to do . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3337

Mr. Justice Crampton - Was it in the house you heard this ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3338

No , it was on the side of the bridge . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3339

Oh ! I thought you went into a house ? OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3340

No , my lord . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3341

Mr. Tomb - It has been ruled that what has been done by persons going
to a meeting is evidence to show the character and nature of that
meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3342

This was so ruled in the Manchester riots , OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3343

and hence the expressions of the persons who had attended the meeting
must show both the nature of that meeting , and what was their
conception of the character of the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3344

Mr. Justice Perrin - In the case that you allude to the expressions
were proved of parties who compelled others to go to a meeting and to
form part of the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3345

Mr. Moore , Q. C. , - Conceived that in the absence of all authority
, they must look to what was common sense and justice .
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3346

The court was asked to take as evidence , against persons who had taken
part in meeting , that which had occurred an hour after the meeting - to
seek to make individuals responsible for what one now might say to
another , and when no one could tell but those persons had been drinking
, when they might have put themselves in a situation of being incapable
of knowing what they were saying or doing ; OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3347

and then , for whatever act they might commit , or whatever improper
expression they might use , to make those who attended the meeting an
hour before , responsible for those acts and those expressions , would
be inconsistent with common sense and justice .
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3348

The Attorney-General deemed that it would not be inconsistent
{TEXT:incosistent} with common sense and justice to receive such
evidence - that so far from it , it would be inconsistent with common
sense and justice not to hold the parties responsible for what was said
and done after a meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3349

In the case of Redford and Burley the expressions used by persons going
to a meeting were held to be evidence . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3350

This would be found in page 55 of the case already referred to .
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3351

These were admitted on the part of the defendants , who justified the
dispersion of the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3352

In that case counsel had been proceeding to ask as to persons having
been seen on the night of the 14th , and the expressions they used , for
the purpose of showing that they were going to be drilled .
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3353

It was contended on the part of the plaintiff , that unless it was shown
that the plaintiff was one of those parties , the evidence was not
admissible . OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3354

Mr. Justice Holroyde ruled , OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3355

and it was afterwards confirmed by the full court .
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3356

When the parties moved for a new trial , it was declared by Lord
Tenterden that the evidence was clearly admissible as to whether there
had been an unlawful conspiracy to excite discontent , and to show
whether the meeting that had been dispersed was unlawful -
OCONNELL-1844-2,228.3357

for this <P_229> purpose , evidence was properly admitted as to
transactions that had occurred in the neighbourhood of Manchester .
OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3358

This was one part of the case , OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3359

and another was , the admissibility of the evidence of witnesses seeing
parties going to a meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3360

In the opinion of Judge Holroyd this was evidence ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3361

and it was confirmed by Judge Tenterden , who observed , with respect to
the declarations of parties going to a meeting , that it was undoubtedly
evidence . OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3362

Now , if it were of importance to show what had been said going to a
meeting , or preparing to go to a meeting , it was equally important to
show what had been said leaving the meeting to show the character of
that meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3363

They had there the remarkable expression used , whether if Mr.
O'Connell were to come there again , the people would be there to meet
him - OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3364

and the question for the jury was , how was that language understood .
OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3365

They had the language of the persons who had attended that meeting that
they were ready to turn out to a man and to fight for Repeal if
necessary . OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3366

Common sense told them that this was the manner in which the language
that had been used at the meeting was so understood by the persons who
had attended it . OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3367

It was part of the <font> res gesta <$$font> - OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3368

the meeting was not over , because the people were dispersing .
OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3369

He referred to Phillips on Evidence , and to a case supplied to him by
his learned friend , Sergeant Warren , in the 15th volume of the State
Trials , page 553 , where there was given in evidence the declarations
of the mob , who pulled down meeting-houses , after having accompanied
Doctor Sacheverell from the place where he had been preaching .
OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3370

Here the persons were going home , OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3371

and nothing would be more important than to show what was their
understanding of what had been said to them by the speakers .
OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3372

Mr. Justice Crampton wished , he said , to look at the case of Redford
and Burley . OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3373

The Attorney_General continued by saying , that let it be supposed that
some of the parties had pulled down Mr. Saunders's house -
OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3374

if they had committed that act of violence as they were going from the
meeting , he insisted upon it that that would be considered against
every one who took part in the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3375

It showed to the court and the jury the impressions which were made on
the people by the speakers that addressed them at the meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3376

The learned gentleman then referred to page 552 of the State Trials , in
Dr. Sacheverell's case , in which such evidence was allowed to be given
by a witness named Daniel Davaron . OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3377

On these grounds he submitted that the evidence should be perfectly
admissible . OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3378

Mr. Whiteside , Q. {TEXT:Q} C. . , in reply , said he did not
contend that what was said or done by persons at the meeting would not
be evidence against the traversers ; but he contended that they could
not be held responsible for language uttered by persons over whom they
had no control , and who were at a distance from them when the alleged
words were used . OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3379

In conclusion he said that there was no case decided that after a
meeting was broken up a traverser was accountable for observations
uttered by persons - OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3380

Justice Perrin said that it would be a different thing if the shoutings
" We will have Repeal , or die for it , " were the act of the whole body
. OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3381

But the only thing proved in the case was a private conversation between
two individuals . OCONNELL-1844-2,229.3382

The Chief_Justice called upon the learned counsel <paren> Tomb <$$paren>
to examine <P_230> the witness as to the nature of the party from whom
the expressions proceeded . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3383

The witness was called , OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3384

and deposed that the crowd were less than half a mile from the place of
meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3385

He could not swear whether they were part of the people who had been at
the meeting or not . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3386

Mr. Tomb said that he could not press the examination of the witness in
reference to the expressions used . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3387

Mr. Moore said of course the jury would erase from their notes that
part of the evidence which referred to the expressions .
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3388

The Chief_Justice , addressing the jury , said that they should
understand that the evidence referred to by the learned counsel should
be erased from their notes . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3389

OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3393

went there the day before the meeting ; OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3394

Captain Drought was the stipendiary magistrate there ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3395

it was notorious that a meeting for a repeal of the union would be held
there ; OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3396

I had heard of it about three weeks before that period .
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3397

Am I to understand it was perfectly notorious in the county three weeks
before the meeting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3398

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3399

And that the object of the meeting was a repeal of the union ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3400

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3401

As long as you were there was not everything perfectly peaceable and
quiet ? OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3402

Yes ; I think it was , except the shouting of the people .
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3403

There was no act of violence committed , or anything like a breach of
the peace ? OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3404

No ; there was not . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3405

Mr. Tomb - You have said that Captain Drought is a stipendiary
magistrate ? OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3406

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3407

What is his state of health ? OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3408

He was very ill when I left Baltinglass . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3409

The court here adjourned for a quarter of an hour .

Great numbers of people were there . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3415

I think I know Mr. O'Connell . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3416

He was pointed out to me at the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3417

I never saw him before . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3418

I went there the day before the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3419

I appeared in plain clothes . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3420

The people were coming in all the morning from different parts of the
country . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3421

I think I saw Mr. O'Connell about two o'clock .
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3422

He came into Baltinglass by the turnpike road .
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3423

There were a great many people with him . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3424

I did not see Mr. O'Connell till he got quite near the platform .
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3425

I heard persons say something about Mr. Saunders .
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3426

I took no note of what I heard said that day . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3427

I made the note next morning . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3428

I can swear it is a correct note of what I heard said .
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3429

I heard persons in the crowd say something respecting Saunders .
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3430

I heard three or four who got together say that Saunders's house ought
to be attacked , OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3431

and the reason they assigned was , " it was once the seat of blood . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3432

This was before Mr. O'Connell came into the town .
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3433

I did not hear them say anything more , except that a man who came up
said he called the coachman to pull up the carriage until Mr. Saunders
could be cheered . OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3434

The man came up in the direction that Mr. O'Connell came up .
OCONNELL-1844-2,230.3435

I heard part of <P_231> a speech made by Mr. O'Connell .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3436

I heard it sufficiently to swear to a particular expression .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3437

I have no note of what he said , OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3438

but I heard him say he would do away with the poor-law and taxes ; and
that he would have the poor supported out of the consolidated fund .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3439

I heard the crowd also say that they would and should have Repeal .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3440

That was before and after the crowd dispersed .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3441

After the meeting I heard the expressions . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3442

The platform was in a field . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3443

There were numbers about the town at the time .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3444

I heard the expressions immediately after leaving the meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3445

The persons who used the expressions were less than a quarter of a mile
from the place of meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3446

The evening before the meeting , on my way to town , I heard expressions
. OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3447

State anything you heard the people saying before the meeting dispersed
. OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3448

I heard persons saying at the meeting what I have stated with regard to
Mr. Saunders . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3449

I do not recollect that anything else was said upon the ground ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3450

but when they were coming , I heard a man say , " We will have the
Repeal or we will have a fight . " OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3451

That occurred the night before , OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3452

and was said by a man who told me that he was going to the meeting .

I can@ @not tell the time that the people began to come in .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3458

I had no work to do in my capacity of a policeman .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3459

There was no breach of the peace that I saw , or even the appearance of
it . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3460

I heard one person say , when Mr. O'Connell called to have cheers for
Mr. Saunders , that he ought to be attacked . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3461

I was then upon the platform . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3462

The crowd was very thick . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3463

There was not any other policeman there with me .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3464

I had an inspector there that day , OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3465

but he was not at the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3466

There was a superior in rank to me there , Constable Godfred , and one
other constable . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3467

I am not certain where Mr. Hawkshaw was there that day .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3468

I was speaking to him one part of it . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3469

When Mr. O'Connell said there should be a cheer for Mr. Saunders , the
people said he should be attacked . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3470

After the meeting was over , some of the people went away .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3471

To Mr. Holmes - I saw Mr. Hawkshaw in the town , and not at the

I went there from my station on Friday OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3480

and arrived on Saturday . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3481

I saw the meeting collecting . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3482

There were several bands . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3483

The people came from different parts . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3484

There was a great number at the meeting ; OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3485

you need not be particular as to a_thousand or two ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3486

There were about 2,000 . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3487

I was sometimes within nine or ten yards of the platform .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3488

I saw Mr. O'Connell then . OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3489

I heard expressions from the crowd about the platform .
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3490

I took no note of what occurred at the time , or afterwards ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3491

but I have a distinct recollection of hearing Mr. O'Connell say " that
he would get a Repeal if the people would stand to him for he was able
to get it ; " OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3492

he also said " they would have Repeal ; OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3493

they had Lord Wicklow as a member of parliament ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3494

and what did he do for them ? " OCONNELL-1844-2,231.3495

He mentioned that some of the landlords had tried to prevent their
<P_232> tenants coming to the meeting , but they had come ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3496

and he asked " if he wanted them again would they not come . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3497

They said they would , OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3498

and all put up their hands . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3499

When he said he would get Repeal , the people replied that he would ,
and that they would willingly fight {TEXT:tight} for it .
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3500

I heard nothing else during the meeting from the crowd .
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3501

I heard a Mr. Reilly speak . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3502

He made mention of " the villanous government which had the bones of
Irishmen perishing in Cabul and in other places , " and " the devil's
cure to them for going . " OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3503

He said also " that he hoped the people would never put themselves in
the same way again ; " OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3504

and they replied that they would not . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3505

I am a policeman ; OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3509

I am a sub-constable of the lowest grade . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3510

I had no superior {TEXT:supeior} there that day that I could see .
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3511

I saw Captain Conroy , the county inspector . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3512

Never reported speeches before . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3513

I did not take notes . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3514

I reported all from memory . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3515

I had occasion to refresh my memory at one time on the 6th of August .
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3516

I kept it all in my memory . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3517

I swear that the words of Mr. O'Connell used {COM:sic} were , " We will
have a repeal if you stand to me . " OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3518

Who said " The devil's cure to those who did not fight for Repeal ? "
<paren> laughter <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3519

Judge Crampton - Not those who did not fight for repeal , but those who
went to Cabul <paren> great laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3520

Witness - Mr. Reilly said , " Devil's cure to them , why did they go
there . " OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3521

Was there any treason in that - OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3522

would you go there ? OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3523

I would if I was ordered ; OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3524

I saw Mr. Hawkshaw in the barracks ; OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3525

but I did not see Mr. Daniel . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3526

John M'Cann was the next witness called up , OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3527

but Mr. Rigby , one of the jurors said , before he was examined , the
jury wished to have the last witness again on the table .
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3528

Taylor was recalled , OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3529

and Mr. Rigby asked him to repeat what Mr. Reilly said in his speech .

I am a constable , OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3534

and was stationed in August last in Drummartin station , in the county

I know a place called Clontibret , OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3536

and was there on the 15th of August last . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3537

There was a meeting held there on that day . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3538

It was a large meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3539

I did not see the entire of the persons present , as I made it a point
to attend to the speakers . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3540

I can tell some parts of a few of the speeches .
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3541

I took a few notes . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3542

I took them on that day <paren> day of meeting . <$$paren>
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3543

I can speak from memory of the Rev. Mr Tierney@ @'s speech .
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3544

He spoke very briefly . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3545

A gentleman followed him who was called Councillor Meehan . Next Mr.
O'Neill Daunt . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3546

I forgot to mention that the chairman was speaking when I went on the
platform . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3547

Captain Seymour was the chairman . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3548

A Mr. Jackson spoke also at the meeting , and a Mr. Conway , the
editor of the <font> Newry Examiner . <$$font> OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3549

I took short notes of what the Rev. Mr. Tierney said .
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3550

He said the union was carried by every species of fraud and corruption .
OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3551

In consequence of the crushing I got I could not write any more of what
he said . OCONNELL-1844-2,232.3552

I recollect <P_233> seeing the Rev. Mr. Tierney some time before the
meeting took place . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3553

I saw him convenient to his own house . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3554

He lives in the townlands of Slisnaganchin . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3555

I had a conversation with him about the meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3556

I was instructed to inquire of Mr. Tierney , in consequence of the many
reports , when the meeting would place . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3557

I went to ask him if he would have the kindness to let me know when the
meeting would take place . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3558

As nearly as I can recollect when I went to him the conversation was
this . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3559

He said the day was not yet fixed ; that it depended upon the
convenience of some barristers , to whom he had written to attend .
OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3560

He adverted to the union , OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3561

and he repeated that it had been fraudulently carried .
OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3562

He said it was not binding ; OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3563

he represented it to be a nullity and a concoction ; that it was not
binding upon conscience . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3564

He said that the feeling towards repeal was becoming general ; that it
had extended itself to the army ; that the army were favourable to
repeal , and partook of the enthusiasm of the people ; and that they
could not be so easily led to spill the blood of their fellowmen by the
bayonet , for seeking redress of their grievances peaceably .
OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3565

I remember him speaking as to what the army done in Spain ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3566

That was on the 16th of June . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3567

A juror - Was this all a private conversation with the Rev. Mr.
Tierney ? {TEXT:.} OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3568

I do@ @n't know what you may term it . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3569

I was there on duty . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3570

To Mr. Justice Crampton - There were no persons present at the
conversation , OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3571

but a man came up just as I retired . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3572

Examination continued - OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3573

I had known the Rev. Mr. Tierney before . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3574

I was in uniform at the time . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3575

I live contiguous to his place . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3576

Mr. Moore , Q. C. , here rose , OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3577

and addressing the court , asked if they thought this was evidence to go
to the jury ? OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3578

Mr. Justice Crampton - Surely it is evidence against the Rev. Mr.
Tierney . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3579

It was on the very subject of the meeting that was to take place .
OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3580

Mr. Moore - Anything he said or did at the meeting is evidence I know ,
my lord , OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3581

but anything he might have said a year ago - Mr. Justice Crampton -
That is another matter . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3582

Mr. Moore , Q. C. - We came here prepared upon certain overt acts
which are stated in the indictment . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3583

There is one act stated at the meeting on the 15th of August .
OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3584

We are not in any manner apprised of a conversation alleged to have
taken place two months before the meeting , OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3585

If the crown is at liberty to give evidence of what took place before a
certain meeting was held , it does seem hard that we should be called
upon to be prepared to repel anything Mr. Tierney may have said at a
private conversation . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3586

I make an objection to it . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3587

The Chief_Justice - But , Mr Moore , it is the declaration of the party
himself respecting the preparation for a meeting which had been spoken
of , and that it was known before it was to take place .
OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3588

The witness desired to be informed at what time it would take place .
OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3589

He went to Mr. Tierney {TEXT:Tierne} himself for the purpose of
inquiring , OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3590

and Mr. Tierney told him he could not tell exactly , but that he
{TEXT:it} would shortly , and that he had written to certain barristers
who were to attend . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3591

Surely the conversation had a direct reference to the meeting at
Clontibret , which is made one of the overt acts in the indictment
against Mr. Tierney . OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3592

Examination continued - OCONNELL-1844-2,233.3593

The conversation lasted for about a quarter of <P_234> an hour .
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3594

I recollect more of the conversation . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3595

I recollect his talking about the association .
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3596

He said if it should not ultimately succeed in obtaining its objects ,
the country must get more than the bayonet , or words to that effect .
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3597

Mr. Justice Perrin directed the witness to repeat the last answer ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3598

and the witness did so . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3599

Examination continued - OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3600

It would be difficult to calculate the number at the meeting ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3601

and I did not see all the persons who attended it .

OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3608

I can@ @not say how long he has been so . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3609

There was not any person with me when I had the conversation with Mr.
Tierney on the 16th June . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3610

There were men working in a field near us , OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3611

but I do not think they could hear what we said .
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3612

I am tolerably certain they could not have heard what passed .
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3613

They were more than ten yards distant from us .
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3614

I can write . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3615

I was at the meeting in question , OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3616

and I was dressed in my policeman's clothes . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3617

I was on the platform , OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3618

and I took some notes of what was said . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3619

I have them with me . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3620

I made a short note in my diary of my conversation with Mr. Tierney on
the 16th of June . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3621

I have a copy of it with me . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3622

The diary is at the station in the care of the senior constable .
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3623

The note is to this effect : - OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3624

" Friday , 16th of June , saw Priest Tierney on the subject of the
Clontibret Repeal meeting , who said that the period was not fixed as
yet , and that it depended on the convenience of barristers who were to
attend , and who would give the authorities sufficient notice , &c. &c.
<paren> laughter . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3625

That is the whole of what I took down on the subject of the meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3626

There is not a word of Mr. Tierney's having spoken about Repeal and
Spain in my diary ; OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3627

I have no note of the conversation with regard to Spain and the army .
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3628

When I understood I was to be examined by Captain Johnston I took a sort
of note of it . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3629

That was some time in October . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3630

I am not a Roman_Catholic . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3631

I knew Mr. Tierney before the 16th of June . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3632

He knew me to be a policeman . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3633

Had on my uniform on the 16th . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3634

Has Mr. Tierney ever assisted you in keeping peace in the parish ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3635

If Mr. Tierney wishes me to speak of any assistance he has given me ,
or if the court should deem it expedient that I should do so , I will
tell you ; OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3636

otherwise I would not wish to reveal what I consider to be a secret .
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3637

The Chief_Justice - The court has no objection to your making any
statement you please , in reference to what you have been asked .
OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3638

Witness - He has assisted me , inasmuch as he has sent for me , and
given me information in reference to the concealing of a birth <paren>

There were military and police there , OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3647

but I do@ @nt know who sent them . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3648

Do@ @n't recollect having heard that they were sent to the meeting at
the request or suggestion of Mr. Tierney , OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3649

but I will not swear that I did not hear it . OCONNELL-1844-2,234.3650

Saw no violence of any sort {TEXT:so_t} at the meeting ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3652

Was on the platform when Captain Seymour , the chairman , spoke
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3665

and heard him . OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3666

Took a note of what he said , OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3667

OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3668

Heard him ask " Whether they had all got repeal cards ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3669

and if not , they should lose no time in getting them ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3670

for he had reason to know that other associations had signs and
pass_words , by which they might know each other ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3671

and why should not they " <paren> meaning the repealers <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3672

The chairman also said " I know no other better way of your knowing each
other than your getting repeal cards . " OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3673

The chairman afterwards desired the meeting to go home quietly and
insult no person . OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3674

Also heard Mr. O'Neil Daunt speak , OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3675

and took a note of what he said . OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3676

He commenced by saying , " I bless God belong {COM:sic} to this land and
to this people . OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3677

The people should have this land if they are worthy .
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3678

And who dare say they are not . " OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3679

Heard Mr. Daunt also say , " The repeal movement now or never .
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3680

Now and for ever . OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3681

If Peel and Wellington came and said , ' We will give you everything you
want only give up repeal , ' we would tell them we would not - never .
" OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3682

Also heard him say in another part of his speech , " Before God we swear
they shall not bully us longer . OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3683

If we had an Irish parliament once we would have the power to keep it ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3684

but we must now stand to our colours , and persevere in the course
O'Connell pointed out to us ; OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3685

then in place of six struggles or battles for repeal , one will do for
all . " OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3686

He then said that Ireland should be free , for she deserved her liberty
, and that the Clontibret boys would fight the repeal battle to the last
. OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3687

There were several other speeches delivered . OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3688

OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3694

I was in uniform openly taking notes . OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3695

I did not take down every thing at the time it was said .
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3696

I did not just now read from my notes " six struggles or battles " as
part of what Mr Daunt said ; OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3697

" struggles {TEXT:struggels} " was the word he used .
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3698

Nothing occured requiring the interference of the police .
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3699

There was no disposition to riot . OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3700

There was some confusion in getting upon the platform .
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3701

I spoke to one person when I was taking notes , OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3702

and asked him not to press on me ; OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3703

I told him he would see the proceedings in the newspapers .
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3704

The High Sheriff here handed a letter to the court .
OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3707

The judges read it , OCONNELL-1844-2,235.3708

and <P_236> The Chief_Justice desired the tipstaff to ask whether a
person named Samuel Maunsell , who described himself as residing in No.
42 , Leeson-street , was in the court . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3709

The crier called " Samuel Maunsell " out . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3710

No such person answered . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3711

The Chief_Justice then said - I am very sorry that the progress of the
trial and the public business should be interrupted by the paper which I
now hold in my hand , having been presented to the court by the high
sheriff . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3712

Unless this gentleman wishes to explain what the letter contains , which
, for the present , {TEXT:.} I do not choose to go into the detail of ,
I must apprise him , or anybody that happens to be his friend , and in
hearing of me , that it is a most improper attempt upon behalf of the
individual to interfere with the high sheriff of the county in the
execution and discharge of his duties . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3713

This gentleman must explain this , and attend at the sitting of the
court to-morrow morning . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3714

Justice Crampton - I must add that the sheriff most properly , in the
discharge of his duty , handed the letter up to the court .
OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3717

He would have been wrong if he had not immediately put the court in
possession of the letter . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3718

Justice Perrin - The Chief_Justice {TEXT:Chief_Jussice} has directed any
friend of this gentleman to apprise him of the necessity for his

I arrived there on the 15th of August . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3727

Attended there upon that day . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3728

There were two officers with me . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3729

Was under the command of Captain Duff , the stipendary magistrate of the
district , who also attended at Tara . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3730

Arrived on the ground before the meeting was held .
OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3731

Saw a party of people coming there . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3732

The people were approaching in all directions to Tara .
OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3733

Probably there were 100,000 people there . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3734

Observed musical bands and banners . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3735

There were about fifty bands of music . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3736

The bands had a peculiar dress . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3737

Saw a harp OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3738

but did not hear it playing . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3739

I know {TEXT:Know} Mr. O'Connell . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3740

Did not see any of the traversers around me now .
OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3741

Knew Mr. Steele before , OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3742

but did not see him at Tara . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3743

Was at Tara an hour before Mr. O'Connell arrived .
OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3744

The people were coming to the meeting before that .
OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3745

There was a platform erected on the ground , nearly fifty or sixty
perches from the church . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3746

Mr. Despard was on the ground . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3747

Cross_examined by Mr Close . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3749

<$$heading>

Was some hours walking through the crowd . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3751

The entire demeanour of the crowd was peaceable .
OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3752

There was not the slightest tendency to a breach of the peace .
OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3753

There were females at the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3754

There were a good number of ladies . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3755

Had occasion to observe temperance bands throughout the country .
OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3756

They were there . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3757

These bands were for a considerable time before the meeting in the habit
of using fancy dresses . OCONNELL-1844-2,236.3758

George Despard , Esq , examined by Sergeant Warren .

<$$heading>

I am a magistrate . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3763

Recollect the 15th of August . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3764

Was on that morning in the town of Trim . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3765

Saw assemblages of people there . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3766

They marched from thence to Tara <paren> six Irish miles <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3767

They formed upon the green of Trim , OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3768

and marched through the town . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3769

They marched in ranks four deep . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3770

There were bands and carriages . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3771

There were some people on horseback . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3772

There were persons who assumed command over the others ; persons who had
wands , OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3773

and I understood them to be repeal wardens . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3774

Heard persons saying to others " Keep your step , man ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3775

keep your rank . " OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3776

Went to Tara . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3777

Did all the persons you saw upon Tara come from Trim ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3778

No , nor one-twentieth part of them OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3779

I know there were bands there from Kildare , Wexford , Dublin , and
Westmeath ; OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3780

and a man told me he came from Nenagh . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3781

I was some time on the ground before Mr. O'Connell arrived .
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3782

There were various bands marching from Dublin and other places with
flags and banners flying . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3783

Can you calculate the number of persons who were present at the meeting
of Tara ? OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3784

It would be almost impossible to form an accurate estimate of the number
. OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3785

I had the assistance of an old officer in making the calculation ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3786

and my opinion is that there were one_hundred_thousand persons at least
at the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3787

Calculated that there were about seven_thousand horsemen .
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3788

Counted nineteen bands . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3789

Did not see the people upon the hill of Tara commanded as at Trim .
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3790

I think the procession came up about two o'clock ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3791

and when Mr. O'Connell got on the platform the crowd gathered round ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3792

and in about an hour and a half there was a sudden movement of the
meeting in bodies of about twenty_thousand , as if there was some
concocted plan . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3793

Heard one observation made by the crowd . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3794

I was then standing on the ditch watching the procession .
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3795

A well-dressed man turned round OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3796

and said to me , loud enough to be heard by every one - " That it was
not gentlemen O'Connell wanted there . " OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3797

I looked at him for a moment OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3798

and said - " What does he want ? " When he replied - " He wants men of
bone and sinew like me , who would be able to the work when it comes .
" OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3799

Mr. Walker , the sub-inspector , was standing near at the time .
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3800

I then said - " I suppose he wants men like those frieze-coated men up
there ? " OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3801

He replied - " Just so . " OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3802

I continued to ask where he came from , OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3803

and he told me " that he came from the barony of Shilmalier , in the
county of Wexford , with 2,000 who were joined in Kildare by 3,000 more
. " OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3804

Mr. O'Connell's procession then passed by , OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3805

and he turned round OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3806

and said , " You did not take off your hat to O'Connell . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3807

I answered , " I did not ; " upon which he said - " Then you do not
belong to our party . " OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3808

I replied - " Certainly not ; OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3809

I do not belong to any party here . " OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3810

The man answered - " I know by the curl of your lip that you do not "
<paren> great laughter <$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3811

I continued to say to him , " That I was glad his eyes told him so much
truth ; that I was only amusing myself , and did not belong to any party
. " OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3812

He said - " Oh , no matter , we will let you come on the field for all
that . " OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3813

A person then came up OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3814

and said , " If you do not know that gentleman , you had better let him
alone . " OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3815

I heard them saying , long life to the foreigners ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3816

for some of them mistook Major Westenra for a foreigner .
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3817

Some of them shouted , " Long life to Mr. Leather Roland , "
OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3818

but I afterwards found out that it was Mr. Ledru Rollin they meant
<paren> great laughter <$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,237.3819

<heading>

Cross-examined by Mr. Hatchell . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3822

<$$heading>

They were giving you a <font> Roland <$$font> for your Oliver , I
suppose . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3824

Do you reside at Trim ? OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3825

I do not , OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3826

but I slept there the night before the meeting I was desired to attend
at Tara , and at every public meeting of the kind .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3827

I have been twenty years stationed in that district , in the county
Meath . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3828

I attend fairs , petty sessions , quarter {TEXT:quartar} sessions ,
assizes , &c. OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3829

My person is very well known to men , women , and children <paren>
laughter <$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3830

I sat on the wall , OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3831

and the people passed me . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3832

They did not give me a cheer . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3833

Was it not very disrespectful for none of the troops to salute you -
their {TEXT:their.} general ? OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3834

I am afraid that they did not take me for their general .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3835

I resided in a country place near Rathlyons . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3836

The nearest band is the Trim temperance band . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3837

The men were all dressed in a new uniform upon that occasion .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3838

I know they were , OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3839

for I saw them on Patrick's day before . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3840

I knew this uniform was made up for the occasion .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3841

I saw it in the tailor's shop . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3842

I happened to go in on business . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3843

I never saw them in a similar uniform OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3844

They were fancy dresses . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3845

Those used at the meeting were more like military uniform - very like
the band of the 54th . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3846

I heard one man say , " keep the step , " and another , " keep the ranks
. " OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3847

They were not keeping the step . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3848

I do@ @n't think they knew how to keep the step OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3849

Those who were put in command did not know anything about commanding .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3850

I first went to Dunsany , and then to the hill of Tara .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3851

I walked all over the hill . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3852

Heard there were two bands there more than I reckoned .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3853

Heard there were twenty-one bands there . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3854

There were none of the constabulary there . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3855

Mr. Walker was there in coloured clothes . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3856

Major Westenra came from Trim with me from curiosity .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3857

Did not see any of the family of the Hon. and Rev. Mr. Taylor there .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3858

There were very many respectable looking carriages there .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3859

There were several ladies there . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3860

Major Westenra was with me all the time in coloured clothes .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3861

Do@ @n't know whether Major Westenra is dead or alive now .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3862

He was close to me when the man made the observations to him , when on
the ditch , OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3863

and he said , " We had better get down OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3864

or they will make us take off our hats . " OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3865

Now , I will ask you a very serious question , OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3866

and you may answer me or not , as you like - OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3867

are you Repealer ? OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3868

I will answer you as seriously - OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3869

I am not a Repealer . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3870

Do not know the name of the man who addressed me .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3871

Were you ever in Shilmalier , in the county of Wexford ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3872

Never . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3873

Did you know how many that place could hold ? OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3874

I never inquired . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3875

Did you look at the population returns to see if Shilmalier could supply
2,000 men ? OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3876

Had not that curiosity . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3877

How far is that place from Tara ? OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3878

I should say about 40 miles . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3879

I beg your pardon , OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3880

it is more than 60 miles from Dublin , OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3881

and then add to it the distance from Dublin to Tara , which is at the
other side . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3882

Did the man you were speaking to come through Dublin to Tara ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3883

He said they came through Kildare , and were joined in Kildare by
three_thousand men . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3884

How many men came from the county of Westmeath ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3885

The man did not tell me . OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3886

Must not the resident magistrates between Wexford and Tara have slept
upon their posts to have taken no notice of the march of a body of
two_thousand men ? OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3887

I do not mean to say any such thing ; OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3888

and a county Kildare gentleman told me that he heard large bodies of men
passing his house for two nights before the meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,238.3889

<P_239>

You say there were two_thousand men from Wexford ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3891

I had only the man's word for this to whom I had been speaking .
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3892

You believed him ? OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3893

Yes , at the time . OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3894

Do you believe him now ? OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3895

I think there was a large body of men marched from Wexford , although
the number might be more or less than was stated .
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3896

Did Major Westenra , who was with you , turn pale when he heard what the
man said to you ? OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3897

Why should he . OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3898

Was there , not a platform at the meeting appropriated for ladies alone
? OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3899

There were two platforms on the ground . OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3900

Was not one for the ladies ? OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3901

Can@ @not exactly say . OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3902

You saw no appearance of disturbance at the meeting ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3903

Not the least . OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3904

You made your report to government of what you saw and heard
{COM:missing_period} OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3905

I did . OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3906

Did Mr. Walker , the sub-inspector of police , hear what was said by
the man who spoke to you when you were at the ditch ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3907

I am sure he did . OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3908

Did you learn that Chartists from England came to disturb the meeting at
Tara ? OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3909

No , but I read of some correspondence on the subject in the newspapers
. OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3910

Did you hear Mr. O'Connell speak ? OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3911

I heard none of the speeches . OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3912

Were you informed that the speakers at the meeting denounced the
Chartists ? OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3913

Yes ; and I also heard that I myself was denounced .
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3914

Did you see any such denunciation in any newspaper ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3915

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3916

Would you know the man whose conversation with you you have detailed ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3917

If he were in the same dress and in a similar position , I might .
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3918

Did you desire the sub-inspector to mark him ? OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3919

No ; having no police there , I did not wish to interfere .
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3920

How far did this conversation take place from the platform ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3921

About 100 yards , OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3922

and the words were said just as Mr. O'Connell had passed by , going
into the field where the platform had been erected .
OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3923

Do you know that several of the counties of Ireland wear different
frieze coats ? OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3924

Yes , and I saw men with the frieze of the respective counties of Cavan
, Meath , Louth , Westmeath , and Kildare . OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3925

Did you know any of the persons who were about you when you had the
interview with this unknown man ? OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3926

I did not . OCONNELL-1844-2,239.3927

He is . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3977

Were not the horsemen Conemara men ? OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3978

Mostly so . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3979

Were there not two men on many of the horses ? OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3980

Yes ; in some instances . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3981

And also women riding behind the men ? OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3982

Did not see a great many . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3983

Had many of the cavalry saddles ? OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3984

Some had not saddles . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3985

Were there " gorsoons " at the meeting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3986

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3987

And barefooted men ? OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3988

There were . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3989

Were not the majority barefooted ? OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3990

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3991

Did you think the man who called out " This is the Ballinakill Cavalry "
was serious ? OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3992

I certainly did . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3993

Had the men carbines ? OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3994

I saw none . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3995

Had all the men who followed Mr. Macnamara saddles ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3996

To the best of my opinion they all had leather saddles .
OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3997

Mr. Bennett - Where did you see those who had no saddles ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3998

At various parts of the road as I was coming to my station .
OCONNELL-1844-2,240.3999

The examination of this witness being closed , the Court , shortly after
five o'clock , adjourned . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.4000

<heading>

Eighth day . OCONNELL-1844-2,240.4002

<$$heading>

The Lord_Chief_Justice , Mr. Justice Crampton , and Mr. Justice Perrin
, entered the court at ten minutes past ten o'clock .
OCONNELL-1844-2,240.4004

Mr. Justice Burton is still unable to attend in court .
OCONNELL-1844-2,240.4005

On their lordships taking their seats , {TEXT:.} The Deputy Clerk of the
Crown directed the Crier to call " Samuel Maunsell , 42 , Leeson-street
, " and have him also called in " The Hall . " OCONNELL-1844-2,240.4006

<P_241>

The Crier accordingly called Mr. Maunsell , who did not answer to his
name . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4008

Mr. Henn - I am instructed , my lord , on the part of Mr. Maunsell ,
to state that he was not apprised till a late hour last night of your
lordships' order that he should attend the court this morning .
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4009

He expressed his intention to me of attending the sitting of the court .
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4010

He has also authorised me to state that he wrote the letter under
excited feelings , and is sensible of the impropriety of which he has
been guilty . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4011

He trusts your lordships {TEXT:lordships'} will permit him to make an
affidavit explanatory of the circumstances ; OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4012

but perhaps your lordships {TEXT:lordships'} may be satisfied with his
apology , OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4013

and this affidavit may be rendered unnecessary ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4014

I mentioned to Mr. Maunsell that I thought it would be better for him
to attend the court , to see whether he should put in the affidavit or
not . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4015

He said he would be here , OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4016

and I am surprised he is not . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4017

Judge Crampton - It is past ten o'clock , OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4018

and he may be here soon . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4019

Chief_Justice <paren> to Mr. Henn <$$paren> - I am very glad he has
placed himself under your direction , so as to have the benefit of your
advice . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4020

He was not , I think , aware when he wrote the letter of the predicament
in which he placed himself . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4021

He wrote a very indiscreet letter to the High Sheriff in the execution
of his duty , which was very wrong ; OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4022

and he at the same time committed a gross contempt of court .
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4023

Mr. Henn - I do not excuse or vindicate his conduct , my lord , in that
respect ; OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4024

but he has expressed regret for writing the letter , which he did under
feelings of excitement . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4025

It may be as well to say that the letter has no connexion with the case
at either side . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4026

Chief_Justice - Oh ! that has nothing at all to do with it .
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4027

The Deputy Clerk of the Crown then called over the names of the
traversers and jury . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4028

The first witness called was <heading> James Healy examined by the
Attorney_General . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4029

<$$heading>

I am a sub-constable in the constabulary . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4031

Was at the meeting at Mullaghmast , which took place on the 1st of
October . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4032

Went to the meeting early that day . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4033

I am stationed at Cork , OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4034

and went from Cork , there OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4035

Thinks there were 250,000 at that meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4036

Was on the central part of the field , OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4037

and I was along the road when the procession was coming up .
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4038

A crowd came up in a very boisterous manner , shouting , screeching ,
and driving all before them . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4039

Some of the bands and people arrived , I think , from Carlow and
Kilkenny at an earlier hour than Mr. O'Connell .
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4040

The people came from all directions . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4041

The principal part came through " the long avenue " {COM:missing_period}
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4042

Saw a number of bands . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4043

Some were dressed in uniform . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4044

Saw several documents circulated amongst the people .
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4045

Saw the document now handed to me . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4046

This document was purchased by another person .
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4047

Bought a similar one myself . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4048

The price , I believe , is only a halfpenny , OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4049

but paid a penny for it . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4050

Should think several thousands of these were purchased by the crowd .
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4051

Tore up the one I bought myself . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4052

A sub-inspector of police purchased the other .
OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4053

His name is John Donohan . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4054

The several thousand documents of which I spoke were the same as that
which I bought . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4055

The people were disposing of the documents from an early hour in the
morning until nightfall . OCONNELL-1844-2,241.4056

Saw Mr. O'Connell and Mr. <P_242> Steele at the meeting .
OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4057

They arrived , I think , between two and three o'clock .
OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4058

Saw a great many persons with labels upon their hats , bearing the
inscription - " O'Connell's police . " OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4059

They had pieces of timber in their hands , five or six feet long .
OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4060

Saw flags and banners at the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4061

There was one with the words - " No Saxon threats , " " No Irish slaves
, " " No compromise but Repeal . " OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4062

<paren> The witness pronounced the word Saxon as it were Saxon <$$paren>
. OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4063

These inscriptions were upon a flag of the Castlecomer colliers .
OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4064

Upon another flag were the words - " Border men greet O'Connell , Cead
mille failthe . " OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4065

Upon others were the word " Repeal , " and " We tread the land that bore
us . " OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4066

Near the platform was a banner with the words - " The Queen , O'Connell
, and Repeal . " OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4067

On another was the inscription " Ireland dragged at the tail of another
nation " <paren> laughter <$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4068

Observed one attached to a private carriage with the words " Repeal and
no Separation . " OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4069

On another near the pavilion , were the words " Fixity of Tenure . " On
another " Mullaghmast and its martyrs - a <font> wice <$$font> <paren>
voice <$$paren> from the grave . " OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4070

On another were a dog , with a harp , and something which I can@ @not
describe before it . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4071

On another I saw the words - " No Saxon butchery shall give blood <font>
gout <$$font> for a repast - OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4072

the dog is roused , and treachery expelled from Mullaghmast . "
OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4073

<paren> Witness pronounced the word <font> gout <$$font> as if it were "
gout , " a disease , which caused much laughter <$$paren> .
OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4074

Thinks the words " God save the Queen , " or " The Queen , God bless her
, " were underneath . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4075

The platform was occupied about two hours , OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4076

but the meeting did not then separate . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4077

Heard no observations amongst the people except shouting for Repeal and
old Ireland , and words to that effect . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4078

<heading>

Cross-examined by Mr. M'Donough . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4080

<$$heading>

Heard no expressions amongst the crowd except those which I have
mentioned . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4082

Went amongst the crowd very much that day in the discharge of my duty ,
OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4083

and " minutely " examined what was going on ; OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4084

listened attentively to everything . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4085

You mingled with the groups of people ? OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4086

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4087

And listened to what they were saying ? OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4088

Yes , to anything I could catch . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4089

And all you did catch was " Repeal and old Ireland , " although you were
there during the meeting , and from eight o'clock till the next morning
? OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4090

I was there from the evening before the meeting to eleven o'clock at
night , after the meeting . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4091

I presume you were sent from Cork to the meeting because you were a
stranger ? OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4092

I do@ @n't know ; OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4093

it may have been the reason . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4094

Was it not a very peaceable assemblage ? OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4095

Yes , so far as I have seen there was no riot or breach of the peace
from morning till night - OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4096

all was quiet in that respect . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4097

And you answer me in the affirmative that there was no riot throughout
the day ? OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4098

There was nothing except shouting for repeal . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4099

When you told the Attorney_General that parties remained there that
night , you meant , I presume at the banquet - OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4100

they were enjoying themselves in the tents , I presume ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4101

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4102

In peace and quiet ? OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4103

As far as I saw . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4104

Were not the bands , which arrived from Carlow and Kilkenny , temperance
bands ? OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4105

I think they were . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4106

You have come from the south of Ireland - OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4107

now , have you seen any of the processions of Father Mathew ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4108

Yes , a great many of them . OCONNELL-1844-2,242.4109

<P_243>

And temperance bands were at those processions ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4111

Yes . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4112

How many bands have you seen at a time in his processions ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4113

I have seen more bands than I saw at Mullaghmast .
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4114

How many have you seen at a time ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4115

I have seen 45 at a time . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4116

When did you see them ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4117

On {TEXT:One} the {TEXT:they} day of the Cork temperance procession .
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4118

How many thousand people were in that procession ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4119

I can@ @not exactly say , OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4120

I should think about 300,000 . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4121

Did the temperance bands wear uniform ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4122

Some did . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4123

Had they flags and banners ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4124

Some had - OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4125

very small ones - OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4126

I can@ @not call them flags . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4127

I presume there were inscriptions upon them ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4128

Oh yes , all connected with the temperance movement , as I believe .
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4129

I presume those processions are common in the south of Ireland ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4130

Very common . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4131

How long have you been in the constabulary ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4132

Twelve years . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4133

Have the people improved in their habits in consquence of the temperance
movement ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4134

Very much so ; OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4135

I think there is a great improvement in point of drunkenness <paren>
laughter <$$paren> . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4136

Were you at the procession at Nenagh ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4137

No , I was not . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4138

Describe how the band came from Carlow to Kilkenny ;
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4139

I suppose that they were in great joy ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4140

They appeared to be very wild : OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4141

they drove all before them . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4142

Were you one of the persons who were driven before the people ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4143

I got a little crushing . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4144

There was nothing bad in it though ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4145

No . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4146

Did they injure anybody ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4147

Not that I could learn , except knocking down a gingerbread stand
<paren> laughter . <$$paren> OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4148

They were selling them for profit ; OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4149

they were not giving them for nothing amongst the people .
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4150

There were many persons selling gingerbread , grog , coffee , and things
of that description . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4151

I do not know any of the persons who were selling those things .
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4152

Did not observe a single one of the ballads given for nothing .
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4153

In large assemblages I have frequently seen persons hawking about and
selling ballads , OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4154

and I suppose they took advantage of this large assemblage to do so .
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4155

I saw the persons at the meeting every place where they could make sale
of these ballads . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4156

Have you not even seen persons selling such ballads at the assizes ,
when the judges were sitting in the crown court and in the civil court ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4157

I have seen persons going about at the assizes selling ballads .
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4158

Now , with respect to those men who had papers in their hats with "
O'Connell's Police " on them , did@ @n't you see them preserving peace
and good order at the meeting ? OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4159

I saw them exerting themselves , but not in the way police would .
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4160

Did@ @n't you see them keep the platform clear and preserve order ?
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4161

I believe that was their intention ; OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4162

heard instructions given to them by a person named Walsh to keep order
and quietness about the platform and pavilion ; OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4163

some of them did not comply with that order . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4164

The wands I saw were peeled , smoothed and slight .
OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4165

I will say they were pieces of timber . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4166

Was at the dinner , OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4167

but was not there the entire time . OCONNELL-1844-2,243.4168
