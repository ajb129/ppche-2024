Then the Clerk of the Arraigns <paren> after Silence commanded <$$paren>
read over his Indictment to him , which was as follows :
TOWNLEY-1746-1,12.6

<font> Francis Townley <$$font> , late of the City of <font> Carlisle ,
in <$$font> the County of <font> Cumberland <$$font> , Gent.
{COM:missing_comma} was indicted for that he , <paren> with <font>
Andrew Blood <$$font> and <font> George Fletcher <$$paren> <$$font> not
<P_13> having the Fear of God in his Heart , nor regarding his Duty and
Allegiance , but , being moved and seduced by the Instigation of the
Devil , as a false Traitor against his most serene , illustrious and
excellent Prince , <font> George <$$font> the Second , by the Grace of
God of <font> Great Britain , France <$$font> , and <font> Ireland
<$$font> , King , Defender of the Faith , <font> &c. <$$font> his
supreme , true , lawful , rightful , and undoubted Sovereign Lord , the
cordial Love , and due and true Obedience , Fidelity , and true
Allegiance , which every Subject of our said Lord the King ought to bear
, withdrawing , and utterly to extinguish , intending and contriving ,
and with all his Force , purposing and designing the Government of these
Kingdoms to subvert , change , and alter ; as also our said Lord the
King , to Death , and final Destruction to put and bring , and these
Kingdoms into intolerable and miserable Slavery to subdue and inthral ;
and to fix on the Imperial Throne of these Realms , a Person called the
Prince of <font> Wales <$$font> , in the Time of the late King <font>
James <$$font> the Second , <font> &c. <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,13.7

And the Indictment further chargeth , That he , the said <font> Francis
Townley <$$font> , on the 10th Day of <font> November <$$font> last , in
the 19th Year of the Reign of his present Majesty , did appear , array'd
in a hostile Manner , at the City <font> of Carlisle <$$font> aforesaid
, in the County of <font> Cumberland <$$font> aforesaid , with 3000
Persons and upwards , in a tumultuous and rebellious Manner , with Guns
, Swords , Clubs , Staves , and other Weapons , offensive as well as
defensive , with Drums beating , Colours flying , Pipes playing , and
there , being so array'd , did , in a warlike and hostile Manner , levy
a cruel War , and took Possession of the said City of <font> Carlisle
<$$font> , and the Citadel of the same City , being a City and Citadel
of our Sovereign Lord the King , and made a cruel Slaughter of the
<P_14> Subjects of our Sovereign Lord the King that now is , and the
same City did keep , sustain and defend . TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.8

And this Indictment is laid to be against the King's Peace , his Crown ,
and Dignity , the Duty of their Allegiance , and the Forms of the
Statute in that Case made and provided , <font> &c. <$$font>
TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.9

<font> Clerk <$$font> Gentlemen , Upon this Indictment , the Prisoner at
the Bar has been arraign'd , TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.10

and thereunto has pleaded <font> Not guilty <$$font> ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.11

and for his Trial has put himself upon God and his Country , which
Country you are : TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.12

Your Charge is to inquire , whether he be guilty of the High Treason
whereof he stands indicted , or not guilty ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.13

if you find him guilty , you are to inquire what Goods and Chattels ,
Lands or Tenements he had at the Time of the High Treason committed , or
at any Time since : TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.14

If you find him not guilty , you are to inquire whether he fled for it ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.15

and if you find he fled for it , you are to inquire of his Goods and
Chattels , as if you had found him guilty : TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.16

If you find him not guilty , nor that he did fly for it , you are to say
so , and no more , and hear your Evidence . TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.17

The Council {COM:sic_here_and_passim_for_"counsel"} for the King were
Mr. Attorney_General , Sir <font> John Strange <$$font> , Mr.
Solicitor_General , Sir <font> Richard Lloyd <$$font> , and the
Honourable Mr. <font> York ; <$$font> and for the Prisoner , Mr.
Serjeant <font> Wynne <$$font> , and Mr. <font> Clayton . <$$font>
TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.18

Mr. <font> York , Council for the King . <$$font> May it please your
Lordships , and you Gentlemen of the Jury , This is an Indictment
against <font> Francis Townley <$$font> , the Prisoner at the Bar ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.19

and sets forth , <font> &c. <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.20

<bracket> the Purport of the Indictment is before-@ @mention'd
<$$bracket> {COM:missing_period} TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.21

To this Indictment he hath pleaded <font> Not guilty . <$$font>
TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.22

We shall produce our Witnesses to make good the Charge against the
Prisoner , which if we do , we doubt not that you will find him guilty
of the Indictment . TOWNLEY-1746-1,14.23

Mr. <font> Attorney_General <$$font> My Lords and you Gentlemen <P_15>
of the Jury , The Prisoner at the Bar , having been deeply engaged in
the late unnatural and wicked Rebellion , begun in <font> Scotland
<$$font> , and carried into the Heart of this Kingdom , in order to
overset our present happy Constitution in Church and State , hath made
it necessary for this Prosecution against him : TOWNLEY-1746-1,15.24

I do@ @n't doubt but , in the Course of our Evidence , we shall make it
appear to your Satisfaction , that the Prisoner with two others , whose
Names are <font> Blood <$$font> and <font> Fletcher <$$font> , and other
their Confederates , did assemble in a warlike Manner , and procured
Arms , Ammunition , and other Instruments of War ; and compos'd a
Regiment for the Service of the Pretender to these Realms , to wage War
against his present most sacred Majesty ; and did march through and
invade several Parts of this Kingdom , and unlawfully did seize his
Majesty's Treasure in many Places for the Service of their villainous
Cause , and took away the Horses and other Goods , Merchandize , and
Chattels of many of his Majesty's peaceable Subjects . And that ,
during the said March , the Prisoner , with other Rebels in open
Defiance of his Majesty's undoubted Right and Title to the Crown of
these Realms , frequently caused the Pretender's Son to be proclaimed ,
in {TEXT:n} a publick and solemn Manner , as Regent of these Realms ,
and himself march'd at the Head of a pretended Regiment which they
call'd the <font> Manchester <$$font> Regiment . TOWNLEY-1746-1,15.25

My Lords , I shall not take up the Time of the Court in saying a great
deal ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,15.26

for all that the Prisoner is charg'd with will appear so full and plain
from the Evidence we shall produce for the King , that there will not be
the least Doubt with the Jury to find him guilty . TOWNLEY-1746-1,15.27

Sir <font> John Strange <$$font> then spoke to the following Effect :
TOWNLEY-1746-1,15.28

My Lords , and you Gentlemen of the Jury ; I am <P_16> of Council in
this Case likeways for the Crown : TOWNLEY-1746-1,16.29

I am very far from aggravating this Case against the Prisoner at the Bar
; TOWNLEY-1746-1,16.30

but I can@ @not help observing , that the Engagements which the Prisoner
had embarked in , would have overset one of the most glorious and free
Constitutions that ever was framed , and , I believe I may venture to
say , is the only one in the whole World . TOWNLEY-1746-1,16.31

If an Attempt to subvert the Government , to destroy the King , and set
up a <font> Popish <$$font> Pretender , if marching in an hostile Manner
, carrying on a bloody and destructive War in this Nation , can move
Compassion , or be extenuated , any Rebellion may be palliated over and
excused , since scarce any Circumstance can be added in Aggravation of
that which hath lately been raised and carried on in this Kingdom .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,16.32

Every body knows the Rebellion broke out in <font> Scotland <$$font>
with a small Number of People , and made a very great Progress , 'till
at last the Rebels had the Audaciousness , with the Pretender's Son at
their Head , to fight his Majesty's Forces at <font> Preston-pans
<$$font> , TOWNLEY-1746-1,16.33

and then the Rebellion burrowed into <font> England <$$font> ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,16.34

and the Prisoner at the Bar was with them in <font> Lancashire <$$font>
, particularly at <font> Preston <$$font> , and several other Places ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,16.35

and then they proceeded to <font> Manchester <$$font> , where the
Prisoner form'd a Regiment , and accepted a Commission to be Colonel of
the said Regiment , from the eldest Son of the Pretender , and wore a
white Cockade , and a Plaid Sash , as a Mark of his Authority , and the
Party he sided with ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,16.36

and then advanced from <font> Manchester <$$font> to <font> Derby
<$$font> with his Regiment , where the Rebel Army halted some few Days ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,16.37

but being apprehensive of the Duke of <font> Cumberland <$$font> 's
attacking them , it so alarmed them , that they marched back with great
Precipitation till they came to <font> Carlisle <$$font> , where he
acted as Commandant of the City , and gave out Orders <P_17> to the
Garrison , amongst which he order'd the Houses of some of his Majesty's
faithful Subjects to be set on Fire , but was afterwards obliged by the
<font> Duke <$$font> to surrender to the King's Pleasure ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,17.38

and tho' Humanity may induce you to have Compassion towards the Prisoner
, yet if it is proved he is guilty of the Crimes laid to him , the
Justice of this Nation calls aloud for his Punishment .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,17.39

For no less was to be a Sacrifice , than his Majesty and his Royal
Family <paren> a Succession of Princes , appointed by Divine Providence
, to be not only the Preservers of our Rights and Liberties , but to be
the Guardians of the Protestant Interest in <font> Europe <$$font>
<$$paren> to appease the Fury of a Set of unsatisfy'd People , who have
associated in this most wicked and unnatural Rebellion , and who envied
us , the faithful Subjects of his Majesty , the Blessings we enjoy'd
uninterrupted of our Religious and Civil Rights and Privileges .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,17.40

These People , in order to divert themselves , and amuse the Ignorant ,
had on their Standards or Colours , Motto's that they imagined would be
grateful , <font> viz. <$$font> Liberty <font> and <$$font> Property ,
Church <font> and <$$font> Country . TOWNLEY-1746-1,17.41

But your Lordship , and the Gentlemen of the Jury , as well as the
unfortunate Person who stands before you at the Bar , will excuse me if
I take upon me to interpret the Meaning of their famous Motto or
Inscription , on their Colours , which not to take up too much of the
Time of the Court , I shall do in few Words . TOWNLEY-1746-1,17.42

The <font> Liberty <$$font> they designed , was nothing less than
Slavery ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,17.43

Their intended <font> Property <$$font> was Plunder , which too many of
the good People of this Kingdom hath found ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,17.44

their <font> Church <$$font> was Popery , TOWNLEY-1746-1,17.45

and the Meaning of their <font> Country <$$font> , was only to make
these <P_18> free Kingdoms a Province to <font> France . <$$font>
TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.46

We shall now call our Witnesses , who will give such Proofs against the
Prisoner , that I doubt not , Gentlemen of the Jury , you will find him
guilty of the Treason he stands charged with . TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.47

<font> Mr. Sollicitor_General . <$$font> Call <font> Roger MacDonald .
<$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.48

<font> Roger MacDonald <$$font> being sworn , said , that he knew
Colonel <font> Townley <$$font> the Prisoner , that he saw him at <font>
Derby <$$font> , and , on the Retreat of the Rebel Army from thence , he
march'd at the Head of the <font> Manchester <$$font> Regiment , as
Colonel of the same . TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.49

This Witness also said , that he saw him with a white Cockade in his Hat
, a Brace of Pistols , and was accounted as a principal Officer ,
between <font> Lancaster <$$font> and <font> Preston <$$font> , and he
appeared at the Head of the Regiment , with Colours flying and Drums
beating , and that he had on a Plaid Sash . TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.50

This Witness was then ask'd , what Number at that Time the Rebel Army
might consist of ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.51

and he said , to the best of his Knowledge , he believed 5600 Men , but
not all arm'd . TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.52

This Witness farther depos'd , that the Prisoner at the Bar was always
look'd upon by both Officers and Soldiers , as Colonel of the Regiment
called the <font> Manchester <$$font> Regiment ; and that he gave
Command to all the Officers under him , who obey'd his Command as
principal Officer . - That the Regiment had a Flag with these Words on
one Side , <font> viz. Liberty and Property ; <$$font> and on the other
, <font> Church and Country : <$$font> - that they had some <font>
Artillery <$$font> with them , and the Prisoner always appear'd at the
Head of his Regiment . TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.53

<font> Cross Examination . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.54

<font> Prisoner's Council . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.55

Mr. Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Pray have you had no Promise of
Pardon ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.56

<font> Witness . <$$font> I have had no certain Promise of Pardon .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,18.57

I was first examined , at <font> Inverness <$$font> , by the Judge
<P_19> Advocate of <font> Scotland <$$font> , TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.58

but he did not assure me of a Pardon . TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.59

<font> Prisoner's Council . <$$font> Did not you expect it ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.60

<font> Witness <$$font> , I can@ @not say , TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.61

but I did expect to be pardon'd , TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.62

for I was only a Servant . TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.63

I was brought ashore very poor , and without any thing to subsist on .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.64

<font> King's Council . <$$font> You say you saw the Prisoner , in the
Retreat from <font> Derby <$$font> , command his Regiment :
TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.65

Was not he look'd upon as Colonel ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.66

<font> Witness . <$$font> Yes , I saw him on Horseback very often ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.67

and he always rode at the Head of the Regiment on a bay Horse .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.68

Sir <font> Richard Lloyd . <$$font> Call <font> Samuel Maddox <$$font>
, who appeared and was sworn , and said , the first Time he saw the
Prisoner Colonel <font> Townley <$$font> was at <font> Manchester
<$$font> , about the 6th , 7th , or 8th Day of <font> December <$$font>
last , but the Day he could not particularly remember and said the
Prisoner was made Colonel of the <font> Manchester <$$font> Regiment by
the Pretender's Son ; and one Reason why he was certain he was Colonel
of the Regiment , was , that a Guard from the said Regiment was mounted
every Day , and Sentinels {TEXT:Centinels} placed at the Prisoner's
Quarters ; that he the said <font> Maddox <$$font> marched out with him
in the Station of an Ensign , but never had any Commission , tho' he
carried the Colours as such ; that the Prisoner wore a Sword and a Brace
of Pistols , with a white Cockade in his Hat , and that the Prisoner
gave Command as Colonel of the Regiment , and that he ordered the said
<font> Manchester <$$font> Regiment to be drawn up in the Church Yard ,
in <font> Manchester <$$font> , where the Pretender's Son reviewed them
, and that he marched at the Head of the Regiment as Colonel to <font>
Derby . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,19.69

Their first Day's March from <font> Manchester <$$font> was to <font>
Winslow <$$font> , where the Prisoner appeared also at the Head of the
Regiment , and had a white Cockade in his Hat , a Plaid Sash , a Brace
of Pistols , and <P_20> a Sword ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,20.70

that their next Day's March was to <font> Macclesfield <$$font> , where
he , this Witness , signified , he had an Inclination to leave the
Regiment , and return home to his Master at <font> Manchester <$$font> ,
but was intimidated from so doing , by being threatned , and told , that
if he did , he would have his Brains knock'd out . TOWNLEY-1746-1,20.71

This Witness farther depos'd , that when they were at <font> Derby
<$$font> with the Rebel Army , they beat up for Volunteers for the
<font> Manchester <$$font> Regiment , commanded by the Honourable
Colonel <font> Francis Townley <$$font> , and that the same was done by
the particular Order and Direction of the Prisoner . That when the
Rebel Army retreated from <font> Derby <$$font> , Col. <font> Townley
<$$font> the Prisoner , and some of his Regiment , took out of a House
between <font> Derby <$$font> and <font> Ashborn <$$font> , a Sack full
of Arms , which were concealed under some old Writings ; that the said
Arms were taken with them to <font> Ashborn <$$font> , and lodg'd all
Night in the Prisoner's own Room , and dispos'd of afterwards among his
Men ; that the Prisoner had two Centinels always at his Door all Night
for fear the Duke of <font> Cumberland <$$font> was nearer to them then
they imagined ; that the Prisoner march'd as Col. of the <font>
Manchester <$$font> Regiment , in their Retreat from <font> Derby
<$$font> to <font> Carlisle <$$font> some Times at the Head of the
Regiment ; that when they came to <font> Carlisle <$$font> , the
Prisoner was made by the Pretender's Son Commandant of <font> Carlisle
<$$font> ; and had another Commission given him by the Pretender's Son
to raise a Regiment of Horse ; that so soon as the main Body of the
Rebel Army were gone from <font> Carlisle <$$font> for <font> Scotland
<$$font> , he the Prisoner took on him the Command of the whole Rebel
Forces left there , and that he gave Orders for the Guns to be mounted ,
and also ordered a House to be burnt ; which was accordingly done ,
alledging that several of the King's <P_21> Forces had fired from it ,
and annoyed the Pretender's Army ; and that he particularly directed and
caused several <font> Chevaux_de_Frize <$$font> to be made and fix'd at
the Gates and Entrances to the City , to prevent his Majesty's Horse or
Dragoons from approaching it ; that the Prisoner order'd some of the
Rebel Army then in <font> Carlisle <$$font> , to make a Sally out to
bring in some Sheep , and that the Prisoner mounted the Walls , with a
Pistol in his Hand , to give Notice if the King's Forces was near where
the Men were to go ; that the Prisoner paid the Men of his own Company
himself , as all the Captains of Companies did theirs ; and that he had
heard the Prisoner , when in <font> Carlisle <$$font> in Company with
other Officers , complain that he was fourscore Pounds out of Pocket in
paying his Men ; that , before the Capitulation , this Witness heard the
Prisoner have some Words , and was seemingly in a great Passion with
Colonel <font> Hamilton <$$font> , who was Governor of the Castle or
Citadel of <font> Carlisle <$$font> , for surrendering the Place , and
not making a Defence to the last ; and that he heard the Prisoner
declare , that <font> it was better to die by the Sword , than to fall
into the Hands of those damn'd <$$font> Hanoverians .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,21.72

This Witness being particularly asked by the King's Council , if he had
at any Time seen the Prisoner in <font> Carlisle <$$font> , act as an
Officer , said , that he had particularly seen him encouraging the Rebel
Soldiers to make Sallies out on the King's Forces .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,21.73

<font> Cross Examination of this Witness . <$$font>
TOWNLEY-1746-1,21.74

Mr. <font> Sergeant Wynne . <$$font> Mr. <font> Maddox <$$font> ,
after the Surrender of the Town and Citadel of <font> Carlisle <$$font>
, did not you all expect Mercy ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,21.75

<font> Maddox . <$$font> We were all put Prisoners into the Church .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,21.76

Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Did you all expect to be hang'd ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,21.77

<font> Maddox . <$$font> I ca@ @n't say that , TOWNLEY-1746-1,21.78

for we were in Expectation of being at Liberty again soon .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,21.79

<P_22>

Serj. <font> Wynne <$$font> , Pray do not you expect a Pardon ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.81

or have you had any Promise of a Reward for what you have done in this
Affair ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.82

<font> Maddox . <$$font> I can@ @not say I have ever had any Promise of
a Reward . TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.83

Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> I find you are a very smart young Man ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.84

and I desire to be answer'd to this Question ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.85

Pray have you had any Promise of a Reward or Pardon ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.86

or do you expect any Reward or Pardon after having given your Evidence
against the Prisoner at the Bar , or the other Prisoners that are in
Custody ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.87

<font> Maddox . <$$font> My Brother came to me when I was in <font> New
Prison <$$font> , TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.88

and he did advise me to do the best I could for myself , and serve my
Country . TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.89

Soon after one of his Majesty's Messengers took me away ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.90

and I have been at his House ever since , only at those Times I went to
be examined ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.91

no body ever told me that I should be pardon'd , TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.92

but my Friends advis'd me to do what I have done . TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.93

If I could have a free Pardon I should be very thankful for it .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.94

Mr. <font> Clayton , <paren> another of the Prisoner's Council .
<$$paren> <$$font> Mr. <font> Maddox <$$font> , did not his Royal
Highness the Duke , <paren> when you surrendred Prisoners <$$paren>
promise you Mercy ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.95

<font> Maddox . <$$font> All the Terms his Royal Highness said we were
to expect , were , we should not be put to the Sword , but that we
should be left to his Majesty's Pleasure , which two <font> Scots
<$$font> Officers who went to the Duke , and whose Names were <font>
Abernethy <$$font> and <font> Forbes <$$font> , told us ; and that the
People in <font> Carlisle <$$font> were to deliver up all their Arms at
the Gate , and the Officers were to go into the Church .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,22.96

<font> King's Council . <$$font> Call <font> Austin Coleman <$$font> ,
who appear'd and was sworn , and said , he saw the Prisoner at the Bar
in <font> Carlisle <$$font> , who was call'd Col. <font> Townly
<$$font> , and commanded the <font> Manchester <$$font> Regiment , and
was made Commandant <P_23> of the said City by the Pretender's Son ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.97

and if any of the Soldiers wanted Arms they applied to him ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.98

and he furnish'd them with Firelocks , Pistols and Bayonets ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.99

and that he often had seen the Prisoner order the Guard to mount , and
always acted as their chief Officer , and all the other Officers took
their Orders from him as their Superior . TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.100

<font> Cross Examination . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.101

Mr. Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Pray Sir inform me what Time you
saw the Gentleman at the Bar at <font> Carlisle <$$font> ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.102

was it in the Month of <font> November <$$font> ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.103

<font> Coleman . <$$font> I can@ @not tell what Month it was ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.104

I know I saw him at <font> Carlisle <$$font> , and he had a Commission
from the Pretender's Son . TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.105

Mr. Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Did you ever hear him say he had a
Commission ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.106

<font> Coleman . <$$font> No I never did . TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.107

Mr. Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Then what you say signifies nothing
: TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.108

Was it before <font> Christmas <$$font> or after that you saw him at
<font> Carlisle <$$font> ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.109

<font> Coleman . <$$font> I do@ @n't know when it was I saw him there .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.110

Mr. <font> Clayton . <$$font> Do@ @n't you know what Time of the Year
<font> Christmas <$$font> is ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.111

<font> Coleman . <$$font> I do@ @n't know ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.112

<font> Christmas <$$font> is when <font> Christmas <$$font> comes .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.113

Hand from your Left . TOWNLEY-1746-1,23.114

<font> King's Council . <$$font> Call Capt. <font> Carey <$$font> of

take Care of the Governor of <font> Carlisle <$$font> , and had his
Royal Highness's Orders to examine all the Rebel Prisoners Papers ,
amongst whom he apply'd <P_24> to the Prisoner at the Bar , who said he
had delivered his Commission before to Major <font> Adams . <$$font>
TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.116

He farther said , that the Prisoner had some Guineas in his Pockets ,
and his Watch , which he did not take from him ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.117

for his Royal Highness's Orders were not to take any Money out of the
Pockets of any of the Officers , only to seize all publick Money that
they had collected ; for that what Money they had in their Pockets might
be of Service to them in their Confinement . TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.118

That this Evidence indors'd all the Papers that he found on such of the
Officers as he search'd , TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.119

and said , the Capitulation was sign'd by the Duke of <font> Richmond
<$$font> , Lieutenant_General in the Army ; wherein the Rebels in <font>
Carlisle <$$font> were to be at the King's Pleasure .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.120

<font> Council for the King . <$$font> Sir , are you sure that the
Capitulation that was signed by the Duke of <font> Richmond <$$font> was
mentioned to be reserv'd for the King's Pleasure .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.121

Capt. <font> Carey . <$$font> I ca@ @n't take upon me to be certain of
that ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.122

but I think so . TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.123

<font> King's Council . <$$font> Do you know the Duke of <font>
Richmond <$$font> 's Hand-writing ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.124

Capt. <font> Carey . <$$font> No , I never saw his Grace write .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.125

Then a Paper was shewn him , which he said was the Capitulation ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.126

and was read , as follows . TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.127

' All the Terms his Royal Highness will or can grant to the Rebel
Garrison of <font> Carlisle <$$font> , are , That they shall not be put
to the Sword , but be reserv'd for the King's Pleasure .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.128

If they consent to these Conditions , the Governor and principal
Officers are to deliver themselves up immediately ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.129

and the Castle , Citadel , and all the Gates of the Town , are to be
taken Possession of forthwith by the King's Troops .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.130

All the small Arms are to be lodged in the Town Guard Room ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,24.131

<P_25>

and the rest of the Garrison are to retire to the Cathedral , where a
Guard is to be placed over them . TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.133

No Damage is to be done to the Artillery , Arms , or Ammunition . '

Half an Hour past Two in the Afternoon . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.137

By his Royal Highness's Command , Sign'd <font> Richmond , Lenox
<$$font> , and <font> Aubigney <$$font> , Lieutenant-Generals of his
Majesty's Forces . TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.138

<font> King's Council . <$$font> Call Capt. <font> Nevet <$$font> of
the 3d Regiment of Foot Guards , who appearing , and being sworn , said
, He went by Order of his Royal Highness the Duke to visit and examine
the Rebel Officers in <font> Carlisle ; <$$font> and that the Prisoner
was one of them , and went by the Name of Col. <font> Townley <$$font>
, and Commandant of <font> Carlisle . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.139

<font> King's Council . <$$font> Swear Capt. <font> Vere <$$font> ,
which was done . TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.140

<font> King's Council <$$font> Sir , will you be pleased to tell my
Lords and the Gentlemen of the Jury , what you know of the Prisoner at
the Bar being in the late unnatural Rebellion ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.141

Capt. <font> Vere . <$$font> I saw the Prisoner on the 20th of <font>
November <$$font> at <font> Carlisle <$$font> , TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.142

for I was taken Prisoner a little before by the Rebel Army ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.143

he was called <font> Colonel Townley <$$font> , Colonel of the <font>
Manchester <$$font> Regiment , and Commandant of the Town .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.144

On the 25th of <font> December <$$font> he appear'd with a white Cockade
; TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.145

I went up to Colonel <font> Hamilton <$$font> 's Room , where we talked
of a Capitulation , TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.146

and Mr. <font> Hamilton <$$font> was willing to agree to it :
TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.147

We then wrote a Letter to his Royal Highness the Duke ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.148

and the Messenger who carried it was made a Prisoner ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.149

and Mr. <font> Hamilton <$$font> desired me to go to Capt. <font>
Abernethy <$$font> , and the <font> Scotch <$$font> Officers ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.150

and they all agreed to what was done , TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.151

and the next Day they hung out the white Flag . TOWNLEY-1746-1,25.152

<P_26>

Sir <font> John Strange . <$$font> Did not <font> Townley <$$font>
appear as the Commanding Officer ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.154

Capt. <font> Vere . <$$font> Yes ; I saw his Commission in the Guard
Room . TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.155

Sir <font> John Strange . <$$font> Did you see it in his own Hands ?
{TEXT:.} TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.156

Capt. <font> Vere . <$$font> I ca@ @n't say I did .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.157

Mr. Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Pray , Sir , what are you ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.158

Capt. <font> Vere . <$$font> I am an Officer , TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.159

and was sent by his Grace the Duke of <font> Newcastle <$$font> upon the
publick Service . TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.160

Mr. <font> Davidson <$$font> , a Grocer of <font> Carlisle <$$font> ,
was the next Witness ; who , being call'd and sworn , depos'd , that he
had seen the Prisoner at <font> Carlisle <$$font> , where he acted as
Colonel of the <font> Manchester <$$font> Regiment , and Commandant of
the City of <font> Carlisle ; <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.161

he was present when he ordered a House to be set on fire at <font>
Carlisle ; <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.162

and on this Deponent's asking him the Reason for it , he reply'd , that
several of the Elector of <font> Hanover <$$font> 's Men had fired from
it , and annoy'd his Men . TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.163

Here the King's Council rested it . TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.164

The Council for the Prisoner proceeded now to his Defence ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.165

and pleaded , That Mr. <font> Townley <$$font> was a Gentleman of a
good Family , and that his Education was suitable to his Birth ; but ,
by some Misfortunes in his Family , was obliged to retire to <font>
France <$$font> , which happen'd in the Year 1728 .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.166

Being a Man of Spirit he was soon taken Notice of by the <font> French
<$$font> Court , TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.167

and being recommended to his most Christian Majesty as a Person capable
of a Post in his Army , the King gave him a Commission . In Consequence
of which he serv'd at the Siege of <font> Philipsburgh <$$font> under
the Marshal Duke of <font> Berwick <$$font> , who lost his Life before
the Walls of that Place . TOWNLEY-1746-1,26.168

Our young Officer , Mr. <font> Townley <$$font> , behaved himself there
with such Courage <P_27> and Conduct , as gained him the Respect and
Esteem of all the Officers in the Army . TOWNLEY-1746-1,27.169

He executed all the Orders of his Superiors with the greatest
Intrepidity ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,27.170

and exposed himself on every Occasion in such a Manner , as if Life was
of no Signification , when Honour and the Service of his Master stood in
Competition with it . TOWNLEY-1746-1,27.171

He was likeways in several other Sieges and Engagements , where his
Behaviour was always such as became a Man of Honour ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,27.172

and as he received the Pay of his most Christian Majesty , he thought it
his Duty to serve him with all the Fidelity he was capable of .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,27.173

Thus he continued in that Service from the Year 1728 , till a few Years
since , that he came into <font> England <$$font> , where he privately
resided till about the Time of the Breaking out of the Rebellion ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,27.174

and the <font> French <$$font> King imagining he might be of Service in
promoting his Views , in the Invasion which he had meditated against
these Kingdoms , sent him a Colonel's Commission , to enable him to
raise Forces , and to assist his Ally , the Pretender , in his
Expedition to <font> Scotland . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,27.175

Thus it appears , that he has been sixteen Years in the Service of
<font> France <$$font> ; that he has had the <font> French <$$font>
King's Commission during all that Time , and consequently was as much in
the Service of <font> France <$$font> as any Officer in the <font>
French <$$font> Army ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,27.176

and therefore they were humbly of Opinion , that Col. <font> Townley
<$$font> had as just a Right to the <font> Cartel <$$font> as any <font>
French <$$font> Officer that has been taken by the <font> English
<$$font> , during the Progress of the War between the two Kingdoms .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,27.177

We must acknowledge , that the King's Council have open'd the Nature of
the Indictment with all the Candour that could be expected , and have
not exaggerated the Charge against the Prisoner beyond the Bounds of
Humanity and Good-nature ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,27.178

and we humbly hope they will be of Opinion with us , that tho' the
Prisoner at the Bar should unhappily be found <P_28> acting in this
unnatural Rebellion , yet as he acted under a Commission from the <font>
French <$$font> King , he has a Right to the <font> Cartel <$$font> for
settling the Exchange of Prisoners that may be taken on either Side , in
the War now carried on between the two Kingdoms . TOWNLEY-1746-1,28.179

The Evidence we have to produce in Behalf of the Prisoner , are only
three . TOWNLEY-1746-1,28.180

The first is Capt. <font> Carpentier <$$font> , who will prove , we
hope , to your Lordships' Satisfaction , that Col. <font> Townley
<$$font> was many Years in the <font> French <$$font> Service , under a
Commission from the <font> French <$$font> King ; and , since his being
taken at <font> Carlisle <$$font> , has been constantly supplied from
<font> France ; <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,28.181

the other two , who are <font> John Hayward <$$font> and <font> Thomas
Dickinson <$$font> , we shall bring to invalidate the Evidence of Mr.
<font> Maddox <$$font> , by shewing the Badness of his Character , and
that he is such a Man whose Testimony is not to be credited .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,28.182

And the Prisoner's Council farther observed , that the Indictment was
insufficient , for that they had not mentioned the Day in the Indictment
when the Treason was done , and that by the glorious Statute of the 7th
of King <font> William <$$font> III. which was justly esteemed the
Bulwark of <font> English <$$font> Liberty , directed , that nothing
shall be given in Evidence but what is inserted in the Indictment , and
that the Time not being mentioned in the Indictment when the Treason was
acted , is sufficient to quash it , because it might be so long past as
to intitle the Prisoner to the Benefit of the Limitation enacted in the
said King's Reign ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,28.183

and that Act says , that no Person shall be convicted , or suffer for
High or Petit Treason , unless a Prosecution is begun against the Person
who committed such Treason , in three Years after the Commission of such
Treason . TOWNLEY-1746-1,28.184

<font> Council . <$$font> Pray call M. <font> Carpentier <$$font> ,
who appeared and was sworn . TOWNLEY-1746-1,28.185

<P_29>

<font> Kings Council . <$$font> Pray what would you ask this Gentleman
to {COM:sic} ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.187

<font> Prisoner's Council . <$$font> To prove that the Prisoner had a
Commission from the <font> French <$$font> King , and that he was at the
Siege of <font> Philipsburg . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.188

<font> Court . <$$font> That will be against you ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.189

for no Man that is a liege Subject of his Majesty can justify taking up
Arms , and acting in the Service of a Prince that is actually in War
against his Majesty . TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.190

On which <font> Carpentier <$$font> was set aside , without being
examined . TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.191

Mr. Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Pray call <font> John Hayward
<$$font> ; who appeared and was sworn . TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.192

Mr. Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Pray , Sir , do you know <font>
Samuel Maddox <$$font> , TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.193

and how long have you known him ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.194

<font> John Hayward . <$$font> Yes , Sir , about two Years .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.195

Mr. Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Pray what Character doth he bear ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.196

<font> John Hayward . <$$font> He bears such a very bad Character ,
that I would not believe him upon his Oath . TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.197

<heading>

<font> Cross_Examined . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.199

<$$heading>

Sir <font> John Strange . <$$font> I hope you believe every Person that
join'd with the Rebels , are bad Men . TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.201

<font> Hayward . <$$font> Yes , Sir . TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.202

Sir <font> R. Lloyd . <$$font> What Business are you of ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.203

<font> Hayward . <$$font> I am a Glover and Leather-seller at <font>
Manchester . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.204

After being examined , he went out of Court , TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.205

but was recalled . TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.206

<font> Solicitor_Gen. <$$font> Mr. <font> Hayward <$$font> , Pray did
you see the Prisoner at the Bar in <font> Manchester ? <$$font>
TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.207

<font> Hayward . <$$font> No , I never saw the Prisoner before .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.208

<font> Couns. Clayton . <$$font> Pray call <font> Thomas Dickinson ;
<$$font> who appear'd , and was sworn . TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.209

<font> Couns. Clayton . <$$font> Sir , do you know <font> Samuel
Maddox ? <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,29.210

<P_30>

<font> T. Dickinson . <$$font> Yes , Sir ; he was bound Apprentice to
an Apothecary at <font> Manchester . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.212

<font> Couns. Clayton . <$$font> Pray what Character does he bear ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.213

<font> T. Dickinson . <$$font> A very bad one . TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.214

<font> Couns. Clayton . <$$font> Would you believe him upon his Oath ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.215

<font> T. Dickinson . <$$font> No , I would not , especially upon Life
and Death . TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.216

Sir <font> John Strange . <$$font> For what Reason do you take upon you
to swear , he is not to be believed upon his Oath ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.217

<font> Dickinson . <$$font> I do@ @n't know particularly ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.218

but I have heard he was a very bad Apprentice , and that he had wrong'd
his Master . TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.219

<font> Sir J. Strange . <$$font> Do you know his Master ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.220

<font> Dickinson . <$$font> Yes ; his Master is in <font> London
<$$font> now . TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.221

Sir <font> J. Strange . <$$font> So , for no other Reason , than
because you have heard he was not a good 'Prentice , you take upon you
to swear he is not to be believed on his Oath . TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.222

I suppose you have some more bad 'Prentices in <font> Manchester .
<$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.223

<font> Dickinson . <$$font> Yes , there are . TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.224

Mr. <font> Att._Gen. Dickinson <$$font> , Did you ever see the
Prisoner at <font> Manchester <$$font> at the Time the Rebel Army was
there ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.225

<font> Dickinson . <$$font> Yes . TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.226

<font> Mr. Att._Gen. <$$font> What was he doing there ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.227

<font> Dickinson . <$$font> He was Colonel of the <font> Manchester
<$$font> Regiment . TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.228

<font> Mr. Att._Gen. <$$font> What , in the Pretender's Service ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.229

<font> Dickinson . <$$font> Yes , in the Rebel Army .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.230

<font> The Evidence for the Prisoner being all gone through , Mr.
Solicitor_General replied to what had been objected by the Prisoner's
Council to the Indictment . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.231

Mr. <font> Solicitor_General <$$font> stood up , TOWNLEY-1746-1,30.232

and made a Reply to the Prisoner's Council , wherein he observ'd , the
<P_31> first overt {TEXT:ouvert} Act of High Treason charged against the
Prisoner , is compassing and imagining the Death of the King ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.233

the next is , adhering to the King's Enemies , and levying of War
against his Majesty's Person and Government , TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.234

and this is founded on the Statute of the 25th of <font> Edward the
Third . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.235

And levying of War by one or more Persons , is Treason :
TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.236

That this War has been levy'd , and that Acts of Hostilities have been
committed by the Prisoner , I do@ @n't doubt but that it has been
sufficiently proved to you , Gentlemen of the Jury ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.237

there is no Occasion to prove explicitly all that is laid in the
Indictment ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.238

but that War has been levyed against his Majesty , has been sufficiently
proved , and admitted by the learned Council for the Prisoner ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.239

it has been proved likeways , that the Prisoner , with a tumultuous
Number of Rebels and Traitors , did assemble in several Parts of his
Majesty's Dominions , and levied a cruel and destructive War .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.240

The Council on the other Side would insinuate , that the Crime was
committed before the Day laid in the Indictment , TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.241

therefore the Day of the Commission in the Indictment should be inserted
. TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.242

But , admitting it was so , this Indictment is good ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.243

for in the Case of Sir <font> Harry Gray <$$font> , it was the Opinion
of all the Judges , that Sir <font> Harry <$$font> was guilty ,
notwithstanding that the Fact was committed twelve Years before the
Indictment ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.244

and it is recent in the Memory of many Gentlemen of the Law , that this
was the Case of <font> Chandler , Layer <$$font> , and <font> Bradshaw ;
<$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,31.245

and so it was allowed in constructive Treason , in the Case of <font>
Dammery <$$font> and others , in the Reign of the late Queen <font> Anne
<$$font> , for pulling down of Houses , and many Cases of the like
Nature in Sir <font> Matthew Hale's <$$font> Pleas of the Crown . For
which several Reasons , and what has been mentioned before , I humbly
conceive your Lordship will over-rule this Exception , as having no
<P_32> Weight . <bracket> Upon which the said Motion was overruled by
the Court . TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.246

<$$bracket> Then my Lord_Chief_Justice <font> Lee <$$font> summ'd up the
Evidence very impartially , TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.247

and gave a most eloquent and learned Charge to the Jury . After which
the Jury consulted together in Court , TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.248

but not agreeing in their Verdict , withdrew about ten Minutes ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.249

and when they returned into Court , were called over by the Clerk of the
Arraigns , TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.250

and answered to their Names . TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.251

<font> Clerk of the Arraigns . <$$font> Gentlemen of the Jury , are you
agreed on your Verdict ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.252

<font> Jury . <$$font> Yes . TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.253

<font> Clerk of the Arraigns . <$$font> Who shall say for you ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.254

<font> Jury . <$$font> Our Foreman . TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.255

<font> Clerk of the Arraigns . Francis Townley <$$font> , hold up your
Hand , <font> <paren> which he did <$$paren> <$$font>
TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.256

How say you ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.257

Is <font> Francis Townley <$$font> guilty of the High Treason whereof he
stands indicted , or not guilty ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.258

<font> Foreman . <$$font> Guilty . TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.259

<font> Clerk of the Arraigns . <$$font> What Goods and Chattels , Lands
and Tenements , had he at the Time of the said High Treason committed ,
and at any time since , to your Knowledge ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.260

<font> Jury . <$$font> None . TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.261

<font> Clerk of the Arraigns . <$$font> Hearken to your Verdict , as
the Court has recorded it ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.262

you say that <font> Francis Townley <$$font> is guilty of the High
Treason whereof he stands indicted , TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.263

and you say he had no Goods , nor Chattels , Land or Tenements , at the
Time of the said High Treason committed , or at any time since , to your
Knowledge , TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.264

and so you say all . TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.265

<font> Jury . <$$font> Yes . TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.266

Then Mr. <font> Jones <$$font> , Keeper of the County Gaol {TEXT:Goal}
of <font> Surrey <$$font> , was order'd to take Care of the Prisoner .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,32.267

<P_33_omitted>

<P_34>

<font> Ormsby MacCormack being sworn . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.270

<font> King's Council . <$$font> Mr. <font> MacCormack <$$font> , pray
look upon the Prisoner , TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.271

and then tell the Court , and the Gentlemen of the Jury , what you know
of him ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.272

and speak out loud , that you may be heard . TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.273

<font> MacCormack . <$$font> The first Time that I saw him , was before
the Rebels march'd from <font> Manchester <$$font> to <font> Derby .
<$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.274

<font> King's Council . <$$font> What Appearance did the Prisoner make
at <font> Manchester ? <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.275

Did you look upon him to be an Officer ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.276

<font> MacCormack . <$$font> He had a white Cockade in his Hat ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.277

and marched as Captain in the <font> Manchester <$$font> Regiment .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.278

I saw the Flag that belonged to the Regiment flying ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.279

and the Motto was , <font> Liberty and Property , Church and Country .
<$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.280

<font> King's Council . <$$font> Did he march with all the Rebel Army ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.281

Were there any Pipes playing ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.282

<font> MacCormack . <$$font> There were Pipes playing before the <font>
Highland <$$font> Rebels , but none in the <font> Manchester <$$font>
Regiment . TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.283

- I saw him also at <font> Derby . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.284

<font> Prisoner's Council . <$$font> Pray , Friend , how came you to
know him so particularly ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.285

<font> MacCormack . <$$font> They call'd him Captain <font> Dawson .
<$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,34.286

<bracket> <font> Here the Council for the Prisoner interrupted the
Witness , because there is one <$$font> Dawson <font> now in Custody
<$$font> , <P_35> <font> who was an Officer in the said Regiment , and
the Prisoner's Name is <$$font> Fletcher . TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.287

<$$bracket> <font> King's Council . <$$font> Look at the Prisoner again
. TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.288

<paren> <font> Looking earnestly at him <$$font> <$$paren> <font>
MacCormack . <$$font> Though I may mistake his Name , I am sure he is
the Person that I saw at <font> Derby <$$font> , though I can@ @not
positively say he gave any Command there as an Officer .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.289

I saw him at <font> Preston <$$font> , and other Places along the Road ,
till we came to <font> Carlisle . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.290

<font> King's Council . <$$font> Was you with him at <font> Carlisle ?
<$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.291

<font> MacCormack . <$$font> I was at <font> Carlisle <$$font> ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.292

but he was there before I came , TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.293

and there I saw him act as a Captain ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.294

and when the Soldiers were drawn up in the <font> Castle-Yard <$$font> ,
I saw him there , TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.295

and saw Arms distributed to some of the Soldiers who had none .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.296

<font> Prisoner's Council <$$font> Did you see him distribute any Arms
to any of the Soldiers ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.297

<font> MacCormack . <$$font> I can@ @not say that I did .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.298

<font> Prisoner's Council . <$$font> Then who distributed those Arms ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.299

<font> MacCormack . <$$font> It was a <font> Scotch <$$font> Officer ,
whom I am informed is since killed . TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.300

- I heard so . TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.301

<font> King's Council . <$$font> Was not the Prisoner at the Bar at
<font> Carlisle <$$font> when the Duke was before the Town ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.302

<font> M'Cormack . <$$font> Yes , I am sure he was , and commanded as
an Officer ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.303

he had a white Cockade in his Hat , a <font> Highland <$$font> Sash
Plaid lin'd with white Silk , and all Military Accoutrements that
Officers have . TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.304

<font> King's Council . <$$font> Then you are certain as to his Person
. TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.305

<font> M'Cormack . <$$font> I am certain this is the Gentleman ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.306

for he mounted the very first Captain's Guard that was mounted at <font>
Carlisle . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.307

I saw him at the Surrender , TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.308

and he was carried into the Church , and made Prisoner with the rest of
the Officers . TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.309

Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Are you sure he is the very Man ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,35.310

<P_36>

<font> M'Cormack . <$$font> I am very sure of it , tho' he has been
long out of my Sight . TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.312

<font> Lord_Chief_Justice . <$$font> Consider , you are upon your Oath
, and what you say affects his Life . TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.313

<font> M'Cormack . <$$font> I am sure he@ @'s the very same .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.314

I know his Person perfectly well . TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.315

Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> How can you be so positive to him ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.316

did you ever see him before you came to <font> Manchester ? <$$font>
TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.317

<font> M'Cormack . <$$font> Not to my Knowledge .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.318

Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Where did you come from ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.319

<font> M'Cormack . <$$font> I am an <font> Irishman <$$font> ,

I came from <font> Ireland . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.322

Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> What brought you to <font> Manchester ?
<$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.323

then Business falling short , I went into <font> Warwickshire <$$font> ,

and worked as a Haymaker for my Living . TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.329

<font> Cross Examination . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.330

<font> Prisoner's Court . <$$font> It is a little extraordinary , that
you should take such particular Notice of the Prisoner ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.331

was you in the Rebel Army ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.332

Was he your Commander ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.333

<font> M'Cormack . <$$font> No , he was not ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.334

Capt. <font> Peter Moss <$$font> was my Commander .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.335

Serj. <font> Wynne . <$$font> Had you any Command in the Rebel Army ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.336

was you either a Captain , or a Lieutenant ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.337

<font> M'Cormack . <$$font> I had no Command at all .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.338

<font> Council . <$$font> How came you hither to give your Evidence ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.339

Carrington <$$font> , one of the King's Messengers at <font>
West-Chester <$$font> , TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.340

and I did not know I was to come to <font> London <$$font> to be an
Evidence . TOWNLEY-1746-1,36.341

<P_37>

<font> Council . <$$font> Have you had any Promise of a Pardon ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.343

<font> M'Cormack . <$$font> I have not , TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.344

nor never had to my Knowledge . TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.345

<font> Sir John Strange . <$$font> Pray call <font> Samuel Maddox .
<paren> Who appeared and was sworn . TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.346

<$$paren> King's Council . <$$font> Mr. <font> Maddox <$$font> , Do
you know Mr. <font> Fletcher <$$font> , the Prisoner at the Bar ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.347

<font> Maddox . <$$font> I know him very well , TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.348

and in the Month of last <font> November <$$font> , but I ca@ @n't
particularly remember the Day , I saw him at the <font> Dog-Inn <$$font>
in <font> Manchester <$$font> , where there were several Persons
assembled , TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.349

and his Name was put down as an Officer in a new-raised Regiment ,
called the <font> Manchester <$$font> Regiment ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.350

he marched as a Captain from <font> Manchester <$$font> to <font>
Winslow <$$font> , and from thence on to <font> Macclesfield <$$font> ,
where the said Regiment was drawn up in the Church-yard ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.351

and all the Soldiers who were unarmed had Arms delivered to them ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.352

the Prisoner , Mr. <font> Fletcher <$$font> , had there a Sword by his
Side , TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.353

and appeared in his Regimentals , as Captain , with a white Cockade ,
and a Plaid Sash . TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.354

The Rebels at <font> Macclesfield <$$font> were in general in Confusion
for want of Men , TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.355

and very much dreaded the King's Forces . TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.356

I was determined to return to <font> Manchester <$$font> ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.357

and communicated my Thoughts and Intentions to several of my Comrades ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.358

the Prisoner , Mr. <font> Fletcher <$$font> , heard of my Resolution at
a Place called <font> Blackersey <$$font> , TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.359

and then he came to me , TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.360

and told me it would be a scandalous thing to make such a dishonourable
Retreat ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.361

and , putting his Hand in his Pocket , pulled out a great Parcel of Gold
, TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.362

and told me , I should never want while that lasted .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.363

I marched with him to <font> Derby <$$font> , and back to <font>
Carlisle <$$font> afterwards . TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.364

<font> Cross Examination . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.365

I was with the Regiment three Days before it marched ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.368

and I was never sober all the Time . TOWNLEY-1746-1,37.369

<P_38>

<font> Pr. Coun. <$$font> What , not sober all the Time .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.371

Manchester . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.372

<font> Pr. Coun. <$$font> Where did you see the Prisoner , besides at

<font> Maddox . <$$font> I saw him at <font> Penrith <$$font> ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.374

and I saw him at <font> Carlisle <$$font> , with other Officers , and
with the Pretender's Son ; at both which Places he acted in the Capacity
of a Captain : TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.375

And when <font> Carlisle <$$font> was surrendred , he went into the
Church with other Officers . TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.376

<font> Pr. Council . <$$font> Have you had no Promise of Pardon ?
TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.377

<font> Maddox . <$$font> I have had none ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.378

I told you so , Sir , several Times before . TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.379

<font> Pr. Coun. <$$font> What , did none of your Friends advise you ,
or persuade you to do what you have done ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.380

<font> Maddox . <$$font> I can@ @not say , TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.381

but one of my Relations persuaded me to do what I could to save my own
Life . TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.382

<font> Pr. Coun. <$$font> Could not Mr. <font> Fletcher <$$font> have
escaped to save his Life , if he would ? TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.383

<font> Maddox . <$$font> I can@ @not tell but what he might ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.384

for Capt. <font> Bradshaw <$$font> got away , TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.385

but he soon joined the Army again . TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.386

<font> Pr. Coun. <$$font> Pray what Character does the Prisoner bear
at <font> Manchester ? <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.387

<font> Maddox . <$$font> I do not know much of his general Character ;

He was a Chapman , TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.390

and dealt in Linen before this Affair . TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.391

<font> King's Council . <$$font> Pray call <font> Thomas Bradbury

<font> Evid. <$$font> I lived at <font> Manchester <$$font> when the
Rebels were in that Town ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,38.395

and one Morning , when a Serjeant and Drum were beating up for
Voluntiers at <P_39> the <font> Exchange <$$font> , for the Pretender's
<font> Manchester <$$font> Regiment , I happened to be there , where I
believe there were more than 1000 People assembled ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,39.396

and , when the Serjeant had done his Speech , the Person at the Bar
pulled off his Hat TOWNLEY-1746-1,39.397

and hollowed , TOWNLEY-1746-1,39.398

and said , God bless King <font> J-s <$$font> and Prince <font> C-s .
<$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,39.399

<font> Cross Examination . <$$font> TOWNLEY-1746-1,39.400

being sworn , was asked if he had seen the Prisoner ?

<font> Preston , Penrith <$$font> , and at <font> Carlisle <$$font> ,

<font> Thomas Cragg <$$font> was then called by the King's Council ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,39.409

TOWNLEY-1746-1,39.410

<font> Evid. <$$font> I saw him march from <font> Manchester ; <$$font>
TOWNLEY-1746-1,39.411

and I saw him act on the March as Captain , TOWNLEY-1746-1,39.413

and I saw him surrender at <font> Carlisle <$$font> to his Royal

and was at <font> Carlisle <$$font> when the Rebels surrender'd the Town

When the Officers of the Garrison surrendered themselves <P_40>
Prisoners , and were in Custody , I had a particular Order from his
Royal Highness , to go to the Place of their Confinement , to take the
Names , Ranks , and Qualities of all those that were there .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.419

When I called on the Prisoner at the Bar , he told me he was a Captain ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.420

and when I had taken the Names of all the rest , and what Commissions
they had under the Pretender's Son , I went TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.421

over the Bridge at <font> Manchester <$$font> , TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.433

and he had a very good Share of Business for a young Man .
TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.434

The Rebels came the 29th of <font> November <$$font> to <font>
Manchester <$$font> , TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.435

and we had a great many of them quarter'd upon us ;
TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.436

Mr. <font> Fletcher's <$$font> Mother was very uneasy at the Sight of
them , TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.437

and went away , because she could not bear to see them eat and drink ,
and make free with every thing in the House . TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.438

They tarried at <font> Manchester <$$font> 3 Days ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.439

and upon the 8th <font> of December <$$font> they returned again to

TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.447

he always behaved well and dutiful to King <font> George <$$font> , and
all the Royal Family . TOWNLEY-1746-1,40.448

I never <P_41> saw the least Willingness in him to join with the
Pretender ; TOWNLEY-1746-1,41.449

all the Family were of the Church of <font> England <$$font> ,
TOWNLEY-1746-1,41.450

having very little Weight with the Court <P_42> and Jury , after my
Lord_Chief_Justice had summ'd up the Evidence , the Jury , without going
