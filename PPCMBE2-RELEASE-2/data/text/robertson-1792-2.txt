John Everet , marine , aged about thirty , on February the 3d , 1772 ,
when sentinel over the water on the booms , the night after anchoring in
Praya <P_146> Bay , at the island of St. Jago , was seized with a
chilliness , which was succeeded by alternate heats and rigours , that
continued eight hours ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.9

he became very hot then ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.10

he had a vehement headach ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.11

his bones , particularly his loins , pained him much ;
ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.12

and he was very thirsty . ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.13

A profuse sweat broke out on him , in about three hours after , which
eased him , he said . ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.14

chilliness , ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.15

and p._m. he complained of a violent headach ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.16

all his other complaints were much severer ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.17

and his pulse was full and quick . ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.18

Near ten ounces of blood were took from him , which made him faintish ,
ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.19

and an emetick prescribed for him in four hours after , that brought
much bile off his stomach , gave him several copious stools ,
ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.20

; ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.28

complained of much greater weakness , and giddiness in the remissions ;
ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.29

violence than ever ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,146.38

dejection . ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.231

I ordered him an emetick , which operated very well both by vomit and
stool . ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.232

At 10 p._m. a paroxysm came on with increased violence , the headach
and a pain over his eyes , which were much inflamed , and at the bottoms
of the orbits very severe ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.233

and the lumbago reached quite round the abdomen .
ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.234

with his drink . ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.235

2d . He had a very restless night from a purging ; universal uneasiness
and pains , especially in his head and loins ; an insatiable thirst ,
and a very dry hot skin , together with his other complaints .
ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.236

At 6 p._m. he fell asleep , which did not at all relieve him , being
much disturbed with frightful dreams . ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.237

notions , and a delirium . ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.239

frequently . ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.240

I gave him the bark with the saline mixture , in a state of
effervescence . ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.241

his body was open . ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.242

4th . His skin was hot and dry , ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.243

ROBERTSON-1792-2,151.244

A._m. he <P_152> complained of no pain , ROBERTSON-1792-2,152.245

sighed heavily from great oppression about the scrobiculum cordis ,
ROBERTSON-1792-2,152.246

and his pulse was very irregular . ROBERTSON-1792-2,152.247

At 8 a._m. an exacerbation returned with less violence , which
continued until 10 p._m. ROBERTSON-1792-2,152.248

In its height , I ordered the antimonial medicine every two hours , and
the pediluvium ; and at other times his bark , and a small glass of wine
after every dose , which kept it on his stomach very well .
ROBERTSON-1792-2,152.249

sediment . ROBERTSON-1792-2,152.250

5th . He had an uneasy night , ROBERTSON-1792-2,152.251

ROBERTSON-1792-2,152.254

At 8 p._m. a slight paroxysm to what the former ones were , came on ,
ROBERTSON-1792-2,152.255

6th . He rested well in the night , ROBERTSON-1792-2,152.258

All the symptoms were increased in violence , in the paroxysm ,
ROBERTSON-1792-2,157.461

<$$heading>

Henry Annas , seaman , a strong man , aged about 37 , on the evening of
the 29th of April , lat. observed 01@ @=o= 45 " S , was suddenly seized
with giddiness and faintness , which were followed with a violent
headach , an acute pain of his loins , and universal pains , and heat ,
with great thirst . ROBERTSON-1792-2,157.487

When he complained on the first of May , all his complaints were more
severe ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,157.488

he was sick at his stomach , ROBERTSON-1792-2,157.489

and his pulse was strong and quick . ROBERTSON-1792-2,157.490

I ordered him an emetick , the antimonial draughts every four hours
after , subacid drink and <P_158> the pediluvium to be used .
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.491

In the evening there was an imperfect remission , only for the first
time . ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.492

2d day . At 2 a._m. a paroxysm began with rigours , which continued
until 6 p._m. when he complained of great prostration of strength and
universal soreness ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.493

his thirst was insatiable , and his pulse soft , besides the general
complaints of dejection , burning heat in the palms of his hands , and
the soles of his feet ; a bitter taste in his mouth ,
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.494

and nothing pleased his taste . ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.495

I ordered him an ounce of sal. cath. amar. and after they were
wrought off , the same medicines as the preceding night , with plenty of
drink . ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.496

At 9 p._m. an exacerbation of the fever and symptoms commenced .
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.497

3d . He was troubled with great inquietude , ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.498

and the fever continued until 1 a._m. when he was seized with rigours
which lasted three hours , ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.499

and a most violent paroxysm followed , that continued until 4 p._m.
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.500

His former complaints were greatly exacerbated ;
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.501

and he had a dysuria ; a great pain and stricture about his eyes ; an
oppression about the scrobiculum cordis ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.502

his tongue was brown and dry , and his mouth parched ,
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.503

In the remission , his spirits and strength were quite prostrated ,
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.505

and he was very giddy . ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.506

I continued the antimonial medicine , in the Sp. Minder. with subacid
drink , and the pediluvium every two hours in the paroxysm -
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.507

His body was sufficiently open . ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.508

4th . He had a tolerable night ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.509

and early a._m. another acccesion of the fever and symptoms began ,
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.510

and continued until 4 p._m. ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.511

His medicines were repeated as before . ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.513

5th . He was easy in the night . ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.514

At 2 p._m. he was suddenly taken speechless ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.515

and some time after I was sent for to see him , ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.516

and was told he was just dying . ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.517

When I saw him , he lay on his back , ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.518

his eyes were not quite closed , ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.519

his countenance was very ghastly , and covered with a cold clammy sweat
, as was his breast ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.520

his extremities were cold , ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.521

his hands were folded over the scrobiculum cordis ;
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.522

his pulse was thready , tremulous , and vermicular at times ;
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.523

the hypochondria were tumid ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.524

he was wholly senseless and motionless , excepting convulsive twiches
about his mouth . ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.525

He continued in this lifeless state about an hour , notwithstanding he
was well rubbed with flannel clothes sprinkled with volatiles , without
altering his posture ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.526

as soon as he could swallow , some drops were given him internally ,
with a little drink ; ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.527

and when the tibiae internae were well rubbed in that manner , they were
embrocated with warm vinegar , and large blisters applied to them .
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.528

After that apoplexy , syncope , or whatever any one chooses to call it ,
a mere frenzy followed . ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.529

His countenance was exceedingly flushed , ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.530

his eyes were greatly inflamed , ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.531

the muscles of the neck were quite rigid , the abdomen tense , his skin
burning hot , ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.532

his pulse was very irregular , with a subsultus tendinum ;
ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.533

he was highly delirious and unmanageable , and his tongue quite black
and dry . ROBERTSON-1792-2,158.534

administered pulv. contrayerv. c. & camphor. ana gr. viii. twice ,
ROBERTSON-1792-2,159.536

and his antimonial medicine was repeated every hour , with plenty of
subacid drink before 9 p._m. when the sweat began .
ROBERTSON-1792-2,159.537

tinct. theb. every hour , which his stomach retained .
ROBERTSON-1792-2,159.538

6th . His medicine was given him regularly all night , though there was
no sign of a remission until midnight , ROBERTSON-1792-2,159.539

and he continued taking his bark after the same manner until 4 p._m.
when a paroxysm returned , which was as slight as the preceding
remission was moderate and distinct {TEXT:dinstinct} .
ROBERTSON-1792-2,159.540

From the time that he began to take the bark , until the return of the
paroxysm which was nineteen hours , he swallowed and kept down four
ounces and an half of bark . ROBERTSON-1792-2,159.541

He then took only a drachm for a dose . ROBERTSON-1792-2,159.542

his wine allowed him . ROBERTSON-1792-2,159.547

Before the 15th , when he would return to his duty , he had taken a

and for some time after , I gave him twice a day , an infusion of it in
wine . ROBERTSON-1792-2,159.549

He was very slightly affected with the change of weather afterwards .
ROBERTSON-1792-2,159.550

A number more of our men had the fever , from lying ashore at St.
Thomas's , ROBERTSON-1792-2,159.551

but all recovered from the same method of treatment .
