<$$heading>

March 7th , 1835 . DARWIN-1835-2,382.37

- We staid only three days at Concepcion , DARWIN-1835-2,382.38

and then sailed for Valparaiso . DARWIN-1835-2,382.39

The wind being northerly , we only reached the mouth of the harbour of
Concepcion before it was dark . DARWIN-1835-2,382.40

Being very near the land , and a fog coming on , the anchor was dropped
. DARWIN-1835-2,382.41

Presently a large American whaler appeared close alongside of us ;
DARWIN-1835-2,382.42

and we heard the Yankee swearing at his men , to make them keep quiet ,
whilst he listened where the breakers were . DARWIN-1835-2,382.43

Captain FitzRoy hailed him in a loud clear voice , to anchor where he
then was . DARWIN-1835-2,382.44

The poor man must have thought the voice came from the shore : such a
Babel of cries issued at once from the ship - every one hallooing out ,
" Let go the anchor ! DARWIN-1835-2,382.45

veer cable ! DARWIN-1835-2,382.46

shorten sail ! " DARWIN-1835-2,382.47

It was the most laughable thing I ever heard . DARWIN-1835-2,382.48

If the ship's crew had been all captains , and no men , there could not
have been a greater uproar of orders . DARWIN-1835-2,382.49

We afterwards found that the mate stuttered . DARWIN-1835-2,382.50

I suppose all hands were assisting him in giving his orders .
DARWIN-1835-2,382.51

On the 11th we anchored at Valparaiso ; DARWIN-1835-2,382.52

and two days afterwards I set out on an excursion to cross the
Cordillera . DARWIN-1835-2,382.53

I proceeded to Santiago , where Mr. Caldcleugh most kindly <P_383>
assisted me in every possible way , in making the little preparations
which were necessary . DARWIN-1835-2,383.54

In this immediate part of Chile there are two passes across the Andes to
Mendoza , and the plains on the opposite side . DARWIN-1835-2,383.55

The one most commonly used , namely , that of Aconcagua , or Uspallata ,
is situated some way to the northward of the capital :
DARWIN-1835-2,383.56

the other , called the Portillo , is to the southward , and less distant
. DARWIN-1835-2,383.57

The latter is , however , rather more lofty , and from the double chain
, more dangerous during a snow-storm . DARWIN-1835-2,383.58

For these reasons it is but little used , especially late in the season
. DARWIN-1835-2,383.59

March 18th . DARWIN-1835-2,383.60

- We set out for the Portillo pass . DARWIN-1835-2,383.61

Leaving Santiago we crossed the wide burnt-up plain on which that city
stands , DARWIN-1835-2,383.62

and in the afternoon arrived at the Maypo , one of the principal rivers
in Chile . DARWIN-1835-2,383.63

The valley , at the point where it enters the first Cordillera , is
bounded on each side by lofty barren mountains ; DARWIN-1835-2,383.64

and although not broad , it is very fertile . DARWIN-1835-2,383.65

Numerous cottages were surrounded by vines , and by orchards of apple ,
nectarine , and peach trees ; the boughs of the latter breaking with the
weight of the beautiful ripe fruit . DARWIN-1835-2,383.66

In the evening we passed the custom-house , where our luggage was
examined . DARWIN-1835-2,383.67

The frontier of Chile is better guarded by the Cordillera , than by the
waters of the sea . DARWIN-1835-2,383.68

There are very few valleys which lead to the central ranges ,
DARWIN-1835-2,383.69

and , except by these , the mountains are far too steep and lofty for
any beast of burden to pass over them . DARWIN-1835-2,383.70

The customhouse officers were very civil ; which was perhaps partly
owing to the passport which the President of the republic had given me ;
DARWIN-1835-2,383.71

but I must also express my admiration at the natural politeness of
almost every Chileno . DARWIN-1835-2,383.72

In this instance the contrast with the same class of men in most other
countries was strongly marked . DARWIN-1835-2,383.73

I may mention an anecdote with which I was much pleased at the time .
DARWIN-1835-2,383.74

We met near Mendoza a little and very fat negress , riding astride on a
mule . DARWIN-1835-2,383.75

She had a <font> goitre <$$font> so enormous , that it was scarcely
possible to avoid gazing at her for a moment ; DARWIN-1835-2,383.76

but my two companions almost instantly , by way of apology , <P_384>
made the common salute of the country , by taking off their hats .
DARWIN-1835-2,384.77

Where would one of the lower classes in Europe have shown such feeling
politeness to a poor and miserable object of a degraded race ?
DARWIN-1835-2,384.78

At night , we slept at a cottage . DARWIN-1835-2,384.79

Our manner of travelling was delightfully independent .
DARWIN-1835-2,384.80

In the inhabited parts we bought a little firewood ,
DARWIN-1835-2,384.81

hired pasture for the animals , DARWIN-1835-2,384.82

and bivouacked in the corner of the same field with them .
DARWIN-1835-2,384.83

Carrying an iron pot , we cooked and ate our supper under the cloudless
sky , DARWIN-1835-2,384.84

and knew no trouble . DARWIN-1835-2,384.85

My companions were Mariano Gonzales , who had formerly accompanied me ,
and an " arriero " with his ten mules and a " madrina . "
DARWIN-1835-2,384.86

The madrina <paren> or godmother <$$paren> is a most important personage
. DARWIN-1835-2,384.87

She is an old steady mare , with a little bell round her neck ;
DARWIN-1835-2,384.88

and where soever she goes , the mules , like good children , follow her
. DARWIN-1835-2,384.89

If several large troops are turned into one field to graze , in the
morning the muleteer has only to lead the madrinas a little apart , and
tinkle their bells ; DARWIN-1835-2,384.90

and , although there may be two or three_hundred mules together , each
immediately knows its own bell , DARWIN-1835-2,384.91

and separates itself from the rest . DARWIN-1835-2,384.92

The affection of these animals for their madrinas saves infinite trouble
. DARWIN-1835-2,384.93

It is nearly impossible to lose an old mule ; DARWIN-1835-2,384.94

for if detained for several hours by force , she will , by the power of
smell , like a dog , track out her companions , or rather the madrina ;
DARWIN-1835-2,384.95

for , according to the muleteer , she is the chief object of affection .
DARWIN-1835-2,384.96

The feeling , however , is not of an individual nature ;
DARWIN-1835-2,384.97

for I believe I am right in saying , that any animal with a bell will
serve as madrina . DARWIN-1835-2,384.98

In a troop each animal carries , on a level road , a cargo weighing 416
pounds <paren> more than twenty-nine stone <$$paren> ; but in a
mountainous country a_hundred pounds less . DARWIN-1835-2,384.99

Yet with what delicate slim limbs , without any proportional bulk of
muscle , these animals support so great a burden !
DARWIN-1835-2,384.100

The <P_385> mule always appears to me a most surprising animal .
DARWIN-1835-2,385.101

That a hybrid should possess more reason , memory , obstinacy , social
affection , and powers of muscular endurance , than either of its
parents , seems to indicate that art has here outmastered nature .
DARWIN-1835-2,385.102

Of our ten animals , six were intended for riding and four for carrying
cargoes , each taking turn about . DARWIN-1835-2,385.103

We carried a good deal of food , in case we should be snowed up , as the
season was rather late for passing the Portillo . DARWIN-1835-2,385.104

March 19th . DARWIN-1835-2,385.105

- We rode during this day to the last , and therefore most elevated
house in the valley . DARWIN-1835-2,385.106

The number of inhabitants became scanty ; DARWIN-1835-2,385.107

but wherever water could be brought on the land , it was very fertile .
DARWIN-1835-2,385.108

All the valleys in the Cordillera agree in the same kind of structure .
DARWIN-1835-2,385.109

An irregularly-@ @stratified mass of well-rounded shingle , together
with a little mud and sand , fills up the bottom to the depth of some
hundred feet . DARWIN-1835-2,385.110

This deposit follows the course of the valley , sloping upwards with a
most gradual and gentle inclination . DARWIN-1835-2,385.111

The rivers have removed a large part in the centre ; thus leaving a
terrace of equal height , but varying width , on each side .
DARWIN-1835-2,385.112

This narrow space between the cliffs bordering the bed of the river ,
and the foot of the mountains , is the only part fit for cultivation ,
DARWIN-1835-2,385.113

and on it likewise the road is carried . DARWIN-1835-2,385.114

The rivers , such as the Maypo , which flow in these valleys , should
rather be called mountain torrents . DARWIN-1835-2,385.115

Their inclination is very great , and their water the colour of mud .
DARWIN-1835-2,385.116

The roar which the Maypo made , as it rushed over the great rounded
fragments , was like that of the sea . DARWIN-1835-2,385.117

Amidst the din of rushing waters , the noise from the stones , as they
rattled one over another , was most distinctly audible even at a
distance . DARWIN-1835-2,385.118

This rattling noise , night and day , may be heard along the whole
course of the torrent . DARWIN-1835-2,385.119

The sound spoke eloquently to the geologist : DARWIN-1835-2,385.120

the thousands and thousands of stones , which , striking against each
other , make the one dull uniform sound , are all hurrying in one
direction . DARWIN-1835-2,385.121

It is like thinking of time , where the minute that <P_386> now glides
past is irrecoverable . DARWIN-1835-2,386.122

So is it with these stones ; DARWIN-1835-2,386.123

the ocean is their eternity , DARWIN-1835-2,386.124

and each note of that wild music tells of one other step towards their
destiny . DARWIN-1835-2,386.125

It is not possible for the mind to comprehend , except by a slow process
, any effect which is produced by a cause repeated so often , that the
multiplier itself ceases to convey any more definite idea , than the
savage receives when he points to the hairs of his head .
DARWIN-1835-2,386.126

As often as I have seen beds of mud , sand , and shingle , accumulated
to the thickness of many thousand feet , I have felt inclined to exclaim
that causes , such as the present rivers and the present beaches , could
never have ground down such masses . DARWIN-1835-2,386.127

But , on the other hand , when listening to the rattling noise of these
torrents , and calling to mind that whole races of animals have passed
away from the surface of the globe , during the period throughout which
, night and day , these stones have gone rattling onwards in their
course , I have thought to myself , can any mountains , any continent ,
withstand such waste ? DARWIN-1835-2,386.128

In this part of the valley , the mountains on each side are from about
three to six or eight_thousand feet high : DARWIN-1835-2,386.129

their outline is rounded , but with steep and bare flanks .
DARWIN-1835-2,386.130

The general colour of the rock is a dullish purple , and the
stratification very distinct . DARWIN-1835-2,386.131

If the scenery is not beautiful , it is remarkable and grand .
DARWIN-1835-2,386.132

We met during the day several herds of cattle , which men were driving
down from the higher valleys in the Cordillera . DARWIN-1835-2,386.133

This sign of the approaching winter hurried our steps , more than was
convenient for geological purposes . DARWIN-1835-2,386.134

The house where we slept was situated at the foot of a mountain , on the
summit of which are the mines of S. Pedro de Nolasko .
DARWIN-1835-2,386.135

Sir F. Head wonders how mines have been discovered in situations so
extraordinary , as the bleak summit of the mountain of S. Pedro de
Nolasko . DARWIN-1835-2,386.136

In the first place , metallic veins in this country are generally harder
than the surrounding strata : DARWIN-1835-2,386.137

hence , during the gradual degradation of the hills , they project above
the <P_387> surface of the ground . DARWIN-1835-2,387.138

Secondly , almost every labourer , especially in the northern parts of
Chile , understands something about the appearance of ores .
DARWIN-1835-2,387.139

In the great mining provinces of Coquimbo and Copiapo , firewood is very
scarce , DARWIN-1835-2,387.140

and men are employed in searching for it over every hill and dale ;
DARWIN-1835-2,387.141

and by this means nearly all the richest mines have there been
discovered . DARWIN-1835-2,387.142

Chanuncillo , from which silver , to the value of many hundred_thousand
pounds has been raised in the course of a few years , was thus
discovered : DARWIN-1835-2,387.143

a man having thrown a stone at his loaded donkey , afterwards thought
that it was very heavy , DARWIN-1835-2,387.144

and picking it up again , he found it was full of pure silver .
DARWIN-1835-2,387.145

The vein occurred at no great distance , standing up like a wedge of
silver . DARWIN-1835-2,387.146

The miners also , on Sundays , taking a crowbar with them , often set
out on such discoveries . DARWIN-1835-2,387.147

In the south part of Chile , the men who drive cattle into the
Cordillera , and who frequent every ravine where there is a little
pasture , are the usual agents . DARWIN-1835-2,387.148

March 20th . DARWIN-1835-2,387.149

- As we ascended the valley , the vegetation , with the exception of a
few pretty alpine flowers , became exceedingly scanty ;
DARWIN-1835-2,387.150

and of birds , animals , or insects , scarcely one could be seen .
DARWIN-1835-2,387.151

The lofty mountains , their summits marked with a few patches of snow ,
stood well separated from each other ; the valleys being filled up with
an immense thickness of stratified alluvium . DARWIN-1835-2,387.152

I may here briefly remark , without detailing the reasons on which the
opinion is grounded , that in all probability this matter was
accumulated at the bottoms of deep arms of the sea , which running from
the inland basins , penetrated to the axis of the Cordillera , - in a
similar manner to what now happens in the southern part of this same
great range . DARWIN-1835-2,387.153

This fact , in itself most curious , as preserving a record of a very
ancient state of things , possesses a high theoretical interest , when
considered in relation to the kind of elevation by which the present
great altitude of these mountains has been attained .
DARWIN-1835-2,387.154

<P_388>

The features in the scenery of the Andes which struck me most , as
contrasted with the few other mountain chains with which I am acquainted
, were , - the flat fringes sometimes expanding into narrow plains on
each side the valleys , - the bright colours , chiefly red and purple ,
of the utterly bare and precipitous hills , - the grand and continuous
wall-like dikes , - the strongly-marked strata which , when nearly
vertical , form the most picturesque and wild pinnacles , but where less
inclined , great massive mountains ; the latter occupying the outskirts
of the range , and the former the more lofty and central parts , -
lastly , the smooth conical piles of fine and brightly-@ @coloured
detritus , which slope at a high angle from the flanks of the mountains
to their bases , some of the piles having a height of more than
two_thousand feet . DARWIN-1835-2,388.156

I frequently observed both in Tierra del Fuego , and within the Andes ,
that where the rock was covered during the greater part of the year with
snow , it was shivered in a very extraordinary manner into small angular
fragments . DARWIN-1835-2,388.157

Scoresby has observed the same fact in Spitzbergen :
DARWIN-1835-2,388.158

he says , " The invariably broken state of the rocks appeared to have
been the effect of frost . DARWIN-1835-2,388.159

On calcareous rocks , some of which are not impervious to moisture , the
effect is such as might have been expected ; DARWIN-1835-2,388.160

but how frost can operate in this way on quartz is not so easily
understood , " DARWIN-1835-2,388.161

The whole phenomenon appears to me rather obscure :
DARWIN-1835-2,388.162

for that part of the mountain which is covered during many months by a
mantle of snow , must be less subject to repeated and great changes of
temperature than any other , DARWIN-1835-2,388.163

yet it is the most affected . DARWIN-1835-2,388.164

I have sometimes thought , that the earth and fragments of stone lying
on the surface , were perhaps less effectually removed by means of
slowly percolating snow-water , than by the agency of rain , and
therefore that the <P_389> appearance of a quicker decay of the solid
rock may be deceptive . DARWIN-1835-2,389.165

Whatever the cause may be , the quantity of crumbling stone on the
Cordillera is very great . DARWIN-1835-2,389.166

Occasionally in the spring , masses of such matter slide down the
mountains , DARWIN-1835-2,389.167

and cover the snow-drifts in the valleys ; thus forming natural
ice-houses . DARWIN-1835-2,389.168

We rode over one , the elevation of which was far below the limit of
perpetual congelation . DARWIN-1835-2,389.169

As the evening drew to a close , we reached the Valle del Yeso .
DARWIN-1835-2,389.170

This is a very singular basin , which must have once been a very deep
and large lake : DARWIN-1835-2,389.171

the barrier is formed by a huge mountain of alluvium , on one side of
which the river has cut a gorge . DARWIN-1835-2,389.172

The plain is covered by a little dry pasture , DARWIN-1835-2,389.173

and amidst the surrounding rocky deserts we had the pleasant sight of a
herd of cattle . DARWIN-1835-2,389.174

The valley takes its name of Yeso from a great bed , I should think at
least two_thousand feet thick , of white , and in some parts quite pure
, gypsum . DARWIN-1835-2,389.175

We slept with a party of men , who were employed in loading mules with
this substance , which is used in the manufacture of wine .
DARWIN-1835-2,389.176

March 21st . DARWIN-1835-2,389.177

- We set out early in the morning , DARWIN-1835-2,389.178

and continued to follow the course of the river , which by this time had
become small , till we arrived at the foot of the ridge that separates
the waters flowing into the Pacific and Atlantic oceans .
DARWIN-1835-2,389.179

The road , which as yet had been good , with a steady but very gradual
ascent , now changed into a steep zigzag track . DARWIN-1835-2,389.180

The Cordillera in this part consists of two principal ranges ; the
passes across which attain respectively an elevation of 13,210 and
14,365 feet . DARWIN-1835-2,389.181

The first great line <paren> consisting of course of many subordinate
ones <$$paren> is called Peuquenes . DARWIN-1835-2,389.182

It divides the waters , and therefore <P_390> likewise the republics of
Chile and Mendoza . DARWIN-1835-2,390.183

To the eastward , a mountainous and elevated region separates it from
the second range <paren> called the Portillo <$$paren> overlooking the
Pampas . DARWIN-1835-2,390.184

The streams from the intermediate tract find a passage a little way to
the southward through this second line . DARWIN-1835-2,390.185

I will here give a very brief sketch of the geological structure of
these mountains : first , of the Peuquenes , or western line ;
DARWIN-1835-2,390.186

for the constitution of the two ranges is totally different .
DARWIN-1835-2,390.187

The lowest stratified rock is a dull red or purple claystone porphyry ,
of many varieties , alternating with conglomerates , and breccia
composed of a similar substance : DARWIN-1835-2,390.188

this formation attains a thickness of more than a mile .
DARWIN-1835-2,390.189

Above it there is a grand mass of gypsum , which alternates , passes
into , and is replaced by , red sandstone , conglomerates , and black
calcareous clay-slate . DARWIN-1835-2,390.190

I hardly dare venture to guess the thickness of this second division ;
DARWIN-1835-2,390.191

but I have already said some of the beds of gypsum alone attain a
thickness of at least two_thousand feet . DARWIN-1835-2,390.192

Even at the very crest of the Peuquenes , at the height of 13,210 feet ,
and above it , the black clay-slate contained numerous marine remains ,
amongst which a gryphaea is the most abundant , likewise shells ,
resembling turritellae , terebratulae , and an ammonite .
DARWIN-1835-2,390.193

It is an old story , but not the less wonderful , to hear of shells ,
which formerly were crawling about at the bottom of the sea , being now
elevated nearly fourteen_thousand feet above its level .
DARWIN-1835-2,390.194

The formation probably is of the age of the central parts of the
secondary series of Europe . DARWIN-1835-2,390.195

These great piles of strata have been penetrated , up-heaved , and
overturned , in the most extraordinary manner , by masses of injected
rock , equalling mountains in size . DARWIN-1835-2,390.196

On the bare sides of the hills , complicated dikes , and wedges of
variously-coloured porphyries and other stones , are seen traversing the
strata in every possible form and direction ; proving also by their
intersections , successive periods of violence . DARWIN-1835-2,390.197

The rock which composes the axis of these great <P_391> lines of
dislocation , at a distance very closely resembles granite ,
DARWIN-1835-2,391.198

but on examination , it is found rarely to contain any quartz ; and
instead of ordinary feldspar {TEXT:felspar} , albite .
DARWIN-1835-2,391.199

The metamorphic action has been very great , as might have been expected
from the close proximity of such grand masses of rock , which were
injected when in a liquefied state from heat . DARWIN-1835-2,391.200

When it is known , first , that the stratified porphyries have flowed as
streams of submarine lava under an enormous pressure , and that the
mechanical beds separating them owe their origin to explosions from the
same submarine craters ; secondly , that the whole mass in the lower
part has generally been so completely fused into one solid rock by
metamorphic action , that the lines of division can only be traced with
much difficulty ; and thirdly , that masses of porphyry ,
undistinguishable {COM:sic} by their mineralogical characters from the
two first kinds , have been subsequently injected ; - the extreme
complication of the whole will readily be believed .
DARWIN-1835-2,391.201

We now come to the second range , which is of even greater altitude than
the first . DARWIN-1835-2,391.202

Its nucleus in the section seen in crossing the Portillo pass , consists
of magnificent pinnacles of coarsely-@ @crystallized red granite .
DARWIN-1835-2,391.203

On the eastern flank , a few patches of mica slate still adhere to the
unstratified mass ; DARWIN-1835-2,391.204

and at the foot a stream of basaltic lava has burst forth at some remote
period , - perhaps when the sea covered the wide surface of the Pampas .
DARWIN-1835-2,391.205

On the western side of the axis , between the two ranges , laminated
fine sandstone has been penetrated by immense granitic dikes proceeding
from the central mass , DARWIN-1835-2,391.206

and has thus been converted into granular quartz rock .
DARWIN-1835-2,391.207

The sandstone is covered by other sedimentary deposits , and these again
by a coarse conglomerate , the vast thickness of which I will not
attempt even to estimate . DARWIN-1835-2,391.208

All these coarse mechanical beds dip from the red granite directly
towards the Peuquenes range , as if they passed beneath it ; though such
is not the case . DARWIN-1835-2,391.209

On examining the pebbles composing this conglomerate <paren> which , to
my surprise , betrayed no signs of metamorphic <P_392> action <$$paren>
, I was astonished to find perfectly rounded masses of the black
calcareous clay-slate with organic remains , the same rock which I had
just crossed <font> in situ <$$font> on the Peuquenes .
DARWIN-1835-2,392.210

These phenomena compel us to arrive at the following conclusion : - that
the Peuquenes existed as dry land for a long period anterior to the
formation of the second range , and that , during this period , immense
quantities of shingle were accumulated at its submarine flank .
DARWIN-1835-2,392.211

The action of a disturbing force then commenced : DARWIN-1835-2,392.212

these more modern deposits were injected by dikes , altered by heat ,
and tilted towards the line whence , in the form of sediment and pebbles
, they had originally proceeded , - thus making the offspring at first
appear older than its parent . DARWIN-1835-2,392.213

This second , grand , and subsequent line of elevation is parallel to
the first and more ancient one . DARWIN-1835-2,392.214

I will only make one other geological observation :
DARWIN-1835-2,392.215

the Portillo chain in the neighbourhood of the pass is rather more
elevated than the Peuquenes , DARWIN-1835-2,392.216

yet the waters of the intermediate district have burst a passage through
it . DARWIN-1835-2,392.217

On the supposition of a subsequent and gradual elevation of the second
line , this can be understood ; DARWIN-1835-2,392.218

for a chain of islets would at first appear , DARWIN-1835-2,392.219

and as these were lifted up , the tides would always be working out
deeper and broader channels between them . DARWIN-1835-2,392.220

At the present day , even in the most retired sounds on the southern
coast , the currents in the transverse breaks which connect the
longitudinal channels , is so strong , that I have heard of one instance
where a small vessel under sail was whirled round and round .
DARWIN-1835-2,392.221

Mr. Pentland , when describing an hydrographical phenomenon of a nearly
similar kind , but on an infinitely grander scale , which occurs in
Bolivia , says , " This very curious fact , of rivers escaping through
such an immense mountain-mass as the Bolivian Cordillera , is perhaps
one of the most important points connected with the physical geography
of this portion of the Andes , DARWIN-1835-2,392.222

and deserves to be <P_393> noticed at greater length . "
DARWIN-1835-2,393.223

It would be extremely rash to affirm that the eastern chain in Bolivia ,
like that of central Chile , must be of subsequent origin to the western
one , or that nearer to the Pacific : DARWIN-1835-2,393.224

but excepting through the explanation above offered , the circumstance
that rivers flowing from a less elevated chain , should penetrate one
far more lofty , appears to me quite inexplicable .
DARWIN-1835-2,393.225

About noon we began the tedious ascent of the Peuquenes ,
DARWIN-1835-2,393.226

and then for the first time experienced some little difficulty in our
respiration . DARWIN-1835-2,393.227

The mules would halt every fifty yards , DARWIN-1835-2,393.228

and then the poor willing animals after a few seconds started of their
own accord again . DARWIN-1835-2,393.229

The short breathing from the rarefied atmosphere is called by the
Chilenos " puna ; " DARWIN-1835-2,393.230

and they have most ridiculous notions concerning its origin .
DARWIN-1835-2,393.231

Some say , " all the waters here have puna ; " others that " where there
is snow there is puna ; " DARWIN-1835-2,393.232

- and this no doubt is true . DARWIN-1835-2,393.233

It is considered a kind of disease , DARWIN-1835-2,393.234

and I was shown the crosses over the graves of some who had died "
punado . " DARWIN-1835-2,393.235

Excepting perhaps in the case of a person suffering from some organic
disease of the heart or chest , I should think this must be an erroneous
conclusion . DARWIN-1835-2,393.236

A person near death , would probably at this elevation experience a more
unusual difficulty in breathing than others ; DARWIN-1835-2,393.237

and hence the effect might be assumed as the cause .
DARWIN-1835-2,393.238

The only sensation I felt was a slight tightness over the head and chest
; a feeling which may be experienced by leaving a warm room and running
violently on a frosty day . DARWIN-1835-2,393.239

There was much fancy even in this ; DARWIN-1835-2,393.240

for upon finding fossil shells on the highest ridge , I entirely forgot
the puna in my delight . DARWIN-1835-2,393.241

Certainly the exertion of walking was extreme , DARWIN-1835-2,393.242

and the respiration became deep and laborious . DARWIN-1835-2,393.243

It is incomprehensible to me , how Humboldt and others were able to
ascend to the elevation of 19,000 feet . DARWIN-1835-2,393.244

No doubt a residence of some months in the lofty region of Quito would
prepare the constitution for such an exertion ; DARWIN-1835-2,393.245

yet I am told that in Potosi <paren> about 13,000 feet <$$paren> ,
strangers do not become quite accustomed to the atmosphere for an entire
year . DARWIN-1835-2,393.246

The inhabitants all recommend onions <P_394> for the puna ;
DARWIN-1835-2,394.247

as this vegetable has sometimes been given in Europe for pectoral
complaints , it may possibly be of real service : DARWIN-1835-2,394.248

- for my part , I found nothing so good as the fossil shells !
DARWIN-1835-2,394.249

When about halfway up we met a large party with seventy loaded mules .
DARWIN-1835-2,394.250

It was interesting to hear the wild cries of the muleteers , and to
watch the long string descending ; DARWIN-1835-2,394.251

they appeared so diminutive , there being nothing but the bleak
mountains with which they could be compared . DARWIN-1835-2,394.252

When near the summit , the wind , as generally happens there , was
impetuous and extremely cold . DARWIN-1835-2,394.253

On each side of the ridge we had to pass over broad bands of snow ,
which perpetually lie there , and were now soon to be covered by a fresh
layer . DARWIN-1835-2,394.254

When we reached the crest and looked backwards , a glorious view was
presented . DARWIN-1835-2,394.255

The atmosphere resplendently clear ; the sky an intense blue ; the
profound valleys ; the wild broken forms ; the heaps of ruins , piled up
during the lapse of ages ; the bright-@ @coloured rocks , contrasted
with the quiet mountains of snow ; all these together produced a scene I
never could have figured to my imagination . DARWIN-1835-2,394.256

Neither plant nor bird , excepting a few condors wheeling around the
higher pinnacles , distracted the attention from the inanimate mass .
DARWIN-1835-2,394.257

I felt glad I was alone : DARWIN-1835-2,394.258

it was like watching a thunderstorm , or hearing a chorus of the Messiah
in full orchestra . DARWIN-1835-2,394.259

On several of the patches of perpetual snow , I found the <font>
Protococcus nivalis , <$$font> or red snow , so well known from the
accounts of Arctic navigators . DARWIN-1835-2,394.260

My attention was called to the circumstance by observing the footsteps
{TEXT:footseps} of the mules stained a pale red , as if their hoofs had
been slightly bloody . DARWIN-1835-2,394.261

I at first thought it was owing to dust blown from the surrounding
mountains of red porphyry ; DARWIN-1835-2,394.262

for from the magnifying power of the crystals of snow , the groups of
these atom-like plants appeared like coarse particles .
DARWIN-1835-2,394.263

The snow was coloured only where it had thawed very rapidly , or had
been accidentally crushed . DARWIN-1835-2,394.264

A small portion of it rubbed on paper communicated a faint rose tinge ,
mingled with a little brick red . DARWIN-1835-2,394.265

I placed some of the snow between the leaves of <P_395> my pocket-book ,
DARWIN-1835-2,395.266

and a month afterwards examined with care the pale discoloured patches
on the paper . DARWIN-1835-2,395.267

The specimens , when scraped off , were of a spherical form , with a
diameter of the thousandth of an inch . DARWIN-1835-2,395.268

The central part consists of a blood-red substance , surrounded by a
colourless bark . DARWIN-1835-2,395.269

When living on the snow they are collected in groups , many lying close
together ; DARWIN-1835-2,395.270

I overlooked , however , the thin couch of gelatinous matter on which
they are said to rest . DARWIN-1835-2,395.271

The dried specimens placed in any fluid , as water , spirits of wine ,
or diluted {TEXT:dilated} sulphuric acid , were acted on in two
different ways : DARWIN-1835-2,395.272

sometimes an expansion was caused , at others a contraction .
DARWIN-1835-2,395.273

The central part after immersion invariably appeared as a drop of red
oily fluid , containing a few most minute granules ;
DARWIN-1835-2,395.274

and these probably are the germs of new individuals .
DARWIN-1835-2,395.275

As I before remarked , the wind on the crest of the Peuquenes is
generally impetuous and very cold . DARWIN-1835-2,395.276

It is said to blow steadily from the westward or Pacific side : a
circumstance which is likewise mentioned by Dr. Gillies .
DARWIN-1835-2,395.277

As these observations apply chiefly to the summer season <paren> when
the passes are frequented <$$paren> , we must consider this wind , as an
upper and return current . DARWIN-1835-2,395.278

The Peak of Teneriffe , with a less elevation , and situated in lat.
28@ @=o= , in like manner falls within the return stream .
DARWIN-1835-2,395.279

At first it appears rather surprising , that the trade-wind along the
northern parts of Chile , and on the coast of Peru , should blow in so
very southerly a direction as it does ; DARWIN-1835-2,395.280

but when we reflect , that the Cordillera , running in a north and south
line , intercepts ; like a great wall , the entire depth of the lower
atmospheric current , we can easily see , that the trade-wind must be
drawn northward , following the line of mountains , towards the
equatorial regions , and thus lose part of that easterly movement which
it otherwise would have gained from the rotation of the world .
DARWIN-1835-2,395.281

At Mendoza , on the eastern foot of the Andes , the climate is said to
be subject to long calms , and to frequent <P_396> though false
appearances of gathering rain-storms : DARWIN-1835-2,396.282

we may imagine that the wind , which coming from the eastward is thus
banked up by the line of mountains , would become stagnant and irregular
in its movements . DARWIN-1835-2,396.283

Having crossed the Peuquenes , we descended into the mountainous country
, intermediate between the two ranges , DARWIN-1835-2,396.284

and then took up our quarters for the night . DARWIN-1835-2,396.285

The elevation was probably not much under 11,000 feet , and the
vegetation in consequence exceedingly scanty . DARWIN-1835-2,396.286

The root of a small scrubby plant served as fuel , DARWIN-1835-2,396.287

but it made a miserable fire , DARWIN-1835-2,396.288

and the wind was piercingly cold . DARWIN-1835-2,396.289

Being quite tired with my day's work , I made up my bed as quickly as I
could , DARWIN-1835-2,396.290

and went to sleep . DARWIN-1835-2,396.291

About midnight I observed the sky became suddenly clouded :
DARWIN-1835-2,396.292

I awakened the arriero to know if there was any danger of bad weather ;
DARWIN-1835-2,396.293

but he said that without thunder and lightning there was no risk of a
heavy snowstorm . DARWIN-1835-2,396.294

The peril is imminent , and the difficulty of subsequent escape great ,
to any one overtaken by bad weather between the two Cordillera .
DARWIN-1835-2,396.295

A certain cave offers the only place of refuge : DARWIN-1835-2,396.296

Mr. Caldeleugh , who crossed on this same day of the month , was
detained there for some time by a heavy fall of snow , as is related in
his travels . DARWIN-1835-2,396.297

Casuchas , or houses of refuge , have not been built in this pass as in
that of Uspallata , DARWIN-1835-2,396.298

and therefore , during the autumn , the Portillo is little frequented .
DARWIN-1835-2,396.299

I may here remark , that within the main Cordillera rain never falls ,
DARWIN-1835-2,396.300

for during the summer , the sky is cloudless , DARWIN-1835-2,396.301

and in winter snow-storms alone occur . DARWIN-1835-2,396.302

At the place where we slept , water necessarily boiled , from the
diminished pressure of the atmosphere , at a much lower temperature than
it does in a less elevated country ; the case being the converse of that
of a Papin's digester . DARWIN-1835-2,396.303

In consequence of this , the potatoes , after remaining for some hours
in the boiling water , were nearly as hard as ever .
DARWIN-1835-2,396.304

The pot was left on the fire all night , DARWIN-1835-2,396.305

and next morning it was boiled again , DARWIN-1835-2,396.306

but yet the potatoes were not cooked . DARWIN-1835-2,396.307

I found out this , by overhearing my two companions discussing the cause
; DARWIN-1835-2,396.308

they had come to the simple conclusion , " that the <P_397> cursed pot
<paren> which was a new one <$$paren> did not choose to boil potatoes .
" DARWIN-1835-2,397.309

March 22d . DARWIN-1835-2,397.310

- After eating our potato-less breakfast , we travelled across the
intermediate tract , to the foot of the Portillo range .
DARWIN-1835-2,397.311

In the middle of summer cattle are brought up here to graze ;
DARWIN-1835-2,397.312

but they had now all been removed ; DARWIN-1835-2,397.313

even the greater number of the guanacoes had decamped , knowing well ,
that , if overtaken by a snow-storm , they would be caught in a trap .
DARWIN-1835-2,397.314

We had a fine view of a mass of mountains called Tupungato , the whole
clothed with unbroken snow . DARWIN-1835-2,397.315

From one peak my arriero said he had once seen smoke proceeding ;
DARWIN-1835-2,397.316

and I thought I could distinguish the form of a large crater .
DARWIN-1835-2,397.317

In the maps Tupungato figures as a single mountain ;
DARWIN-1835-2,397.318

this Chileno method of giving one name to a tract of mountains is a
fruitful source of error . DARWIN-1835-2,397.319

In the region of snow there was a blue patch , which no doubt was a
glacier ; - a phenomenon that has been said not to occur in these
mountains . DARWIN-1835-2,397.320

Now commenced a heavy and long climb , similar to that up the Peuquenes
. DARWIN-1835-2,397.321

Bold conical hills of red granite rose on each hand ;
DARWIN-1835-2,397.322

and in the valley there were several broad fields of perpetual snow .
DARWIN-1835-2,397.323

These frozen masses , during the process of thawing , had in some parts
assumed the form of pinnacles or columns , which , as they were high and
close together , caused some difficulty on account of the cargo mules .
DARWIN-1835-2,397.324

This structure in frozen snow was long since observed by Scoresby in the
icebergs near Spitzbergen , and lately , with more care , by Colonel
Jackson on the Neva . DARWIN-1835-2,397.325

On one of these columns of ice a frozen horse was exposed , sticking as
on a pedestal , but with its hind legs straight up in the air .
DARWIN-1835-2,397.326

To account for its strange position , we must <P_398> suppose that the
animal fell with its head downward into a hole , when the stratum was
continuous , and that afterwards the surrounding parts were removed by
the thaw . DARWIN-1835-2,398.327

When nearly on the crest of the Portillo , we were enveloped in a cloud
which was falling , under the form of minute frozen spicula .
DARWIN-1835-2,398.328

This was very unfortunate , as it continued the whole day ,
DARWIN-1835-2,398.329

and quite intercepted our view . DARWIN-1835-2,398.330

The pass takes its name of Portillo from a narrow cleft or doorway on
the highest ridge , through which the road passes .
DARWIN-1835-2,398.331

From this point , on a clear day , those vast plains which extend from
the base of the mountains towards the Atlantic can be seen .
DARWIN-1835-2,398.332

We descended to the upper limit of vegetation , DARWIN-1835-2,398.333

and found good quarters for the night under the shelter of some large
fragments of rock . DARWIN-1835-2,398.334

We here met some passengers , who made anxious inquiries about the state
of the road . DARWIN-1835-2,398.335

Shortly after it was dark , the clouds suddenly cleared away ;
DARWIN-1835-2,398.336

and the effect was quite magical . DARWIN-1835-2,398.337

The great mountains , bright with the full moon , seemed impending over
us on all sides , as if we had been buried at the bottom of some deep
crevice . DARWIN-1835-2,398.338

One morning also , very early , I witnessed the same striking effect .
DARWIN-1835-2,398.339

As soon as the clouds were dispersed , it froze severely ;
DARWIN-1835-2,398.340

but as there was no wind , we slept very comfortably .
DARWIN-1835-2,398.341

The increased brilliancy of the moon and stars at this elevation , owing
to the perfect transparency of the atmosphere , was very remarkable .
DARWIN-1835-2,398.342

Travellers having observed the difficulty of judging heights and
distances amidst lofty mountains , have generally attributed it to the
absence of objects of comparison . DARWIN-1835-2,398.343

It appears to me that it is fully as much owing to this transparency ,
confounding different distances , and partly , likewise , to the novelty
of an unusual degree of fatigue arising from a little exertion , habit
being thus opposed to the evidence of the senses .
DARWIN-1835-2,398.344

I am sure that this extreme clearness of the air gives a peculiar
character to the landscape ; all objects appearing to be brought nearly
into one plane , as in a drawing or panorama . DARWIN-1835-2,398.345

The transparency is , I presume , owing to the equable and nearly
perfect <P_399> state of atmospheric dryness . DARWIN-1835-2,399.346

The latter quality was shown by the manner in which woodwork shrunk
<paren> as I soon found by the trouble my geological hammer gave me
<$$paren> ; by articles of food , such as bread and sugar , becoming
extremely hard ; and by the preservation of the skin and parts of the
flesh of the beasts , which perish on the road . DARWIN-1835-2,399.347

To the same cause we must attribute the singular facility with which
electricity is excited . DARWIN-1835-2,399.348

My flannel-waistcoat , when rubbed in the dark , appeared as if it had
been washed with phosphorus ; DARWIN-1835-2,399.349

- every hair on a dog's back crackled ; DARWIN-1835-2,399.350

- even the linen sheets , and leathern straps of the saddle , when
handled , emitted sparks . DARWIN-1835-2,399.351

March 23d . DARWIN-1835-2,399.352

- The descent on the eastern side of the Cordillera is much shorter or
steeper than on the Pacific side ; DARWIN-1835-2,399.353

in other words , the mountains rise more abruptly from the plains , than
from the alpine country of Chile . DARWIN-1835-2,399.354

A level and brilliantly white sea of clouds was extended beneath our
feet , DARWIN-1835-2,399.355

and thus shut out the view of the equally level Pampas .
DARWIN-1835-2,399.356

We soon entered the band of clouds , DARWIN-1835-2,399.357

and did not again emerge from it that day . DARWIN-1835-2,399.358

About noon , finding pasture for the animals and bushes for firewood ,
in a part of the valley called Los Arenales , we stopped for the night .
DARWIN-1835-2,399.359

This was near the uppermost limit of bushes , DARWIN-1835-2,399.360

and the elevation , I suppose , was between seven and eight_thousand
feet . DARWIN-1835-2,399.361

I was very much struck with the marked difference between the vegetation
of these eastern valleys and that of the opposite side :
DARWIN-1835-2,399.362

yet the climate , as well as the kind of soil , is nearly identical ,
and the difference of longitude very trifling . DARWIN-1835-2,399.363

The same remark holds good with the quadrupeds , and in a lesser degree
with the birds and insects . DARWIN-1835-2,399.364

We must except certain species which habitually or occasionally frequent
elevated mountains ; and in the case of the birds , certain kinds ,
which have a range as far south as the Strait of Magellan .
DARWIN-1835-2,399.365

This fact is in perfect accordance with the geological history of the
Andes ; DARWIN-1835-2,399.366

for these mountains have existed as a great barrier , since a period so
remote that whole races of animals must subsequently have perished from
the face of the earth . DARWIN-1835-2,399.367

Therefore , unless we suppose the same species to have been <P_400>
created in two different countries , we ought not to expect any closer
similarity between the organic beings on opposite sides of the Andes ,
than on shores separated by a broad strait of the sea .
DARWIN-1835-2,400.368

In both cases we must leave out of the question those kinds which have
been able to cross the barrier , whether of salt water or solid rock .
DARWIN-1835-2,400.369

A great number of the plants and animals were absolutely the same , or
most closely allied with those of Patagonia . DARWIN-1835-2,400.370

We here have the agouti , bizcacha , three species of armadillo , the
ostrich , certain kinds of partridges , and other birds , none of which
are ever seen in Chile , but are the characteristic animals of the
desert plains of Patagonia . DARWIN-1835-2,400.371

We have likewise many of the same <paren> to the eyes of a person who is
not a botanist <$$paren> thorny stunted bushes , withered grass , and
dwarf plants . DARWIN-1835-2,400.372

Even the black slowly-@ @crawling beetles are closely similar , and some
, I believe , on rigorous examination , absolutely identical .
DARWIN-1835-2,400.373

It had always been a subject of regret to me , that we were unavoidably
compelled to give up the ascent of the St. Cruz river before reaching
the mountains , DARWIN-1835-2,400.374

I always had a latent hope of meeting with some great change in the
features of the country ; DARWIN-1835-2,400.375

but I now feel sure , that it would only have been following the plains
of Patagonia up an ascent DARWIN-1835-2,400.376

March 24th . DARWIN-1835-2,400.377

- Early in the morning I climbed up a mountain on one side of the valley
, DARWIN-1835-2,400.378

and enjoyed a far-extended view over the Pampas . DARWIN-1835-2,400.379

This was a spectacle to which I had always looked forward with interest
, DARWIN-1835-2,400.380

but I was disappointed . DARWIN-1835-2,400.381

At the first glance there was a strong resemblance to a distant view of
the ocean , DARWIN-1835-2,400.382

but in the northern parts many irregularities in the surface were soon
distinguishable . DARWIN-1835-2,400.383

The most striking feature in the scene consisted of the rivers , <P_401>
which , facing the rising sun , glittered like silver threads , till
lost in the immensity of the distance . DARWIN-1835-2,401.384

In the middle of the day , we descended the valley ,
DARWIN-1835-2,401.385

and reached a hovel , where an officer and three soldiers were posted to
examine passports . DARWIN-1835-2,401.386

One of these men was a thorough-bred Pampas Indian .
DARWIN-1835-2,401.387

He was kept much for the same purpose as a bloodhound , to track out any
person who might pass by secretly , either on foot or horseback .
DARWIN-1835-2,401.388

Some years ago , a passenger had endeavoured to escape detection , by
making a long circuit over a neighbouring mountain ;
DARWIN-1835-2,401.389

but this Indian , having by chance crossed his track , followed it for
the whole day , over dry and very stony parts , till at last he came on
his prey hidden in a gully . DARWIN-1835-2,401.390

We here heard that the silvery clouds , which we had admired from the
bright region above , had poured down torrents of rain .
DARWIN-1835-2,401.391

The valley from this point gradually opened , DARWIN-1835-2,401.392

and the hills became mere water-worn hillocks compared to the giants
behind . DARWIN-1835-2,401.393

It then expanded into a gently-@ @sloping plain of shingle , covered
with low trees and bushes . DARWIN-1835-2,401.394

This talus , although it looked of little breadth , must be nearly ten
miles wide , before it blends into the apparently dead level Pampas .
DARWIN-1835-2,401.395

We had already passed the only house in this neighbourhood
{TEXT:neigbourhood} , the Estancia of Chaquaio ; DARWIN-1835-2,401.396

and at sunset we pulled up in the first snug corner ,
DARWIN-1835-2,401.397

and there bivouacked . DARWIN-1835-2,401.398

March 25th . DARWIN-1835-2,401.399

- I was reminded of the Pampas of Buenos Ayres , by seeing the disk of
the rising sun , intersected by an horizon , level as that of the ocean
. DARWIN-1835-2,401.400

During the night a heavy dew had fallen , a fact we did not experience
within the Cordillera . DARWIN-1835-2,401.401

The road proceeded for some distance due east across a low swamp ;
DARWIN-1835-2,401.402

then , meeting the dry plain , it turned to the north towards Mendoza .
DARWIN-1835-2,401.403

The distance is two very long days' journey . DARWIN-1835-2,401.404

Our first day's journey was called fourteen leagues to Estacado , and
the second seventeen to Luxan , near Mendoza . DARWIN-1835-2,401.405

The whole distance is over a level desert plain , with not more than two
or three houses . DARWIN-1835-2,401.406

The sun was exceedingly powerful , and the ride devoid of all interest .
DARWIN-1835-2,401.407

There is very little water in this " traversia , " DARWIN-1835-2,401.408

and in our <P_402> second day's journey , we found only one little pool
. DARWIN-1835-2,402.409

The water flowing from the mountains is small in quantity
DARWIN-1835-2,402.410

and soon becomes absorbed by the dry and porous soil ; so that ,
although we travelled at the distance of only ten or fifteen miles from
the outer range , we did not cross a single stream .
DARWIN-1835-2,402.411

In many parts the ground was incrusted with a saline efflorescence ;
DARWIN-1835-2,402.412

hence we had the same salt-loving plants , common near Bahia Blanca .
DARWIN-1835-2,402.413

The landscape has one character from the Strait of Magellan along the
whole eastern coast of Patagonia to the Rio Colorado ;
DARWIN-1835-2,402.414

and it appears that the same kind of country extends northerly in a
sweeping line as far as San Luis , and perhaps even further .
DARWIN-1835-2,402.415

To the eastward of this line , lies the basin of the comparatively damp
and green plains of Buenos Ayres . DARWIN-1835-2,402.416

The former country , including the sterile traversia of Mendoza and
Patagonia , consists of a bed of shingle , worn smooth , and accumulated
by the waves of a former sea ; while the formation of the Pampas <paren>
plains covered by thistles , clover , and grass <$$paren> is due to the
estuary mud of the Plata , deposited under a different condition of
circumstances . DARWIN-1835-2,402.417

After our two days' tedious journey , it was refreshing to see in the
distance the rows of poplars and willows growing around the village and
river of Luxan . DARWIN-1835-2,402.418

Shortly before we arrived at this place , we observed to the southward a
ragged cloud of a dark reddish-brown colour . DARWIN-1835-2,402.419

For some time , we had no doubt but that it was thick smoke proceeding
from some great fire on the plains . DARWIN-1835-2,402.420

Soon afterwards we found it was a pest of locusts .
DARWIN-1835-2,402.421

The insects overtook us , as they were travelling northward , by the aid
of a light breeze , at the rate , I should suppose , of ten or fifteen
miles an hour . DARWIN-1835-2,402.422

The main body filled the air from a height of twenty feet , to that , as
it appeared , of two or three_thousand above the ground .
DARWIN-1835-2,402.423

The noise of their approach was that of a strong breeze passing <P_403>
through the rigging of a ship . DARWIN-1835-2,403.424

The sky seen through the advanced guard appeared like a mezzotinto
engraving , DARWIN-1835-2,403.425

but the main body was impervious to sight ; DARWIN-1835-2,403.426

they were not , however , so thick , but that they could escape from a
stick moved backward and forward . DARWIN-1835-2,403.427

When they alighted they were more numerous than the leaves in a field ,
DARWIN-1835-2,403.428

and changed the green into a reddish colour : DARWIN-1835-2,403.429

the swarm having once alighted , the individuals flew from side to side
in any direction . DARWIN-1835-2,403.430

The locusts are not an uncommon pest in this country :
DARWIN-1835-2,403.431

already during the season , several smaller swarms had come up from the
sterile plains of the south ; DARWIN-1835-2,403.432

and many trees had been entirely stripped of their leaves .
DARWIN-1835-2,403.433

Of course this swarm can@ @not even be compared to those of the eastern
world , DARWIN-1835-2,403.434

yet it was sufficient to make the well-known descriptions of their
ravages more intelligible . DARWIN-1835-2,403.435

I have omitted , perhaps , the most striking part of the scene the vain
attempts of the poor cottagers to turn the stream aside .
DARWIN-1835-2,403.436

Many lighted fires DARWIN-1835-2,403.437

and with the smoke , with shouts and waving of branches , they
endeavoured to avert the attack . DARWIN-1835-2,403.438

We crossed the Luxan , which is a river of considerable size , though
its course towards the sea-coast is very imperfectly known .
DARWIN-1835-2,403.439

It is even doubtful whether , in passing over the plains , it is
evaporated , or whether it forms a tributary of the Sauce or Colorado .
DARWIN-1835-2,403.440

We slept in the village , which is a small place surrounded by gardens ,
and forms the most southern part , that is cultivated , of the province
of Mendoza ; DARWIN-1835-2,403.441

it is five leagues south of the capital . DARWIN-1835-2,403.442

At night I experienced an attack <paren> for it deserves no less a name
<$$paren> of the <font> Benchuca <$$font> <paren> a species of Reduvius
<$$paren> the great black bug of the Pampas . DARWIN-1835-2,403.443

It is most disgusting to feel soft wingless insects , about an inch long
, crawling over one's body . DARWIN-1835-2,403.444

Before sucking they are quite thin , DARWIN-1835-2,403.445

but afterwards become round and bloated with blood ,
DARWIN-1835-2,403.446

and in this state they are easily crushed . DARWIN-1835-2,403.447

<P_404>

They are also found in the northern parts of Chile and in Peru .
DARWIN-1835-2,404.449

One which I caught at Iquique was very empty . DARWIN-1835-2,404.450

When placed on the table , and though surrounded by people , if a finger
was presented , the bold insect would immediately draw its sucker , make
a charge , and if allowed , draw blood . DARWIN-1835-2,404.451

No pain was caused by the wound . DARWIN-1835-2,404.452

It was curious to watch its body during the act of sucking , as it
changed in less than ten minutes , from being as flat as a wafer to a
globular form . DARWIN-1835-2,404.453

This one feast , for which the benchuca was indebted to one of the
officers , kept it fat during four whole months ; DARWIN-1835-2,404.454

but , after the first fortnight , the insect was quite ready to have
another suck . DARWIN-1835-2,404.455

March 27th . DARWIN-1835-2,404.456

- We rode on to Mendoza . DARWIN-1835-2,404.457

The country was beautifully cultivated , DARWIN-1835-2,404.458

and resembled Chile . DARWIN-1835-2,404.459

This neighbourhood is celebrated for its fruit ; DARWIN-1835-2,404.460

and certainly nothing could appear more flourishing than the vineyards
and the orchards of figs , peaches , and olives . DARWIN-1835-2,404.461

We bought watermelons nearly twice as large as a man's head , most
deliciously cool and well-flavoured , for a halfpenny apiece ; and for
the value of threepence , half a wheelbarrowful of peaches .
DARWIN-1835-2,404.462

The cultivated and enclosed part of this province is very small ;
DARWIN-1835-2,404.463

there is little more than that which we passed through between Luxan and
the capital . DARWIN-1835-2,404.464

The land , as in Chile , entirely owes its fertility to artificial
irrigation ; DARWIN-1835-2,404.465

and it is really wonderful to observe how abundantly productive a barren
traversia is rendered by this simple process . DARWIN-1835-2,404.466

We staid the ensuing day in Mendoza . DARWIN-1835-2,404.467

The prosperity of the place has much declined of late years .
DARWIN-1835-2,404.468

The inhabitants say " it is good to live in , but very bad to grow rich
in . " DARWIN-1835-2,404.469

The lower orders have the lounging , reckless manners of the Gauchos of
the Pampas ; DARWIN-1835-2,404.470

and their dress , riding-gear , and habits of life , are nearly the same
. DARWIN-1835-2,404.471

To my mind the town had a stupid forlorn aspect . DARWIN-1835-2,404.472

Neither the boasted alameda , nor the scenery , is at all comparable to
that of Santiago ; DARWIN-1835-2,404.473

but to those who have just crossed the unvaried savannahs of grass , on
their road from Buenos Ayres , the gardens and orchards must appear
delightful . DARWIN-1835-2,404.474

Captain Head , speaking of <P_405> the inhabitants , says , " They eat
their dinners , DARWIN-1835-2,405.475

and it is so very hot , they go to sleep - DARWIN-1835-2,405.476

and could they do better ? " DARWIN-1835-2,405.477

I quite agree with Captain Head : DARWIN-1835-2,405.478

the happy doom of the Mendozinos is to eat , sleep , and be idle .
DARWIN-1835-2,405.479

March 29th . DARWIN-1835-2,405.480

- We set out on our return to Chile by the Uspallata pass to the
northward of Mendoza . DARWIN-1835-2,405.481

We had to cross a long and most sterile traversia of fifteen leagues .
DARWIN-1835-2,405.482

The soil in parts was absolutely bare , in others covered by numberless
dwarf cacti , armed with formidable spines , and called by the
inhabitants " little lions . " DARWIN-1835-2,405.483

There were also a few low bushes . DARWIN-1835-2,405.484

Although the plain is elevated about three_thousand feet above the sea ,
the sun was very powerful ; DARWIN-1835-2,405.485

this , and the clouds of impalpable dust , rendered the travelling
extremely irksome . DARWIN-1835-2,405.486

Our course during the day lay nearly parallel to the mountains , but
gradually approaching them . DARWIN-1835-2,405.487

Before sunset we entered one of the wide valleys , or rather bays ,
which open on the plain : DARWIN-1835-2,405.488

this soon narrowed into a ravine , DARWIN-1835-2,405.489

and a little higher up the house of the Villa Vicencio was situated .
DARWIN-1835-2,405.490

As we had ridden all day without a drop of water , both ourselves and
our animals were very thirsty , DARWIN-1835-2,405.491

and we looked out anxiously for the stream which flows down this valley
. DARWIN-1835-2,405.492

It was curious to observe how gradually the water made its appearance :
DARWIN-1835-2,405.493

on the plain the course was quite dry ; DARWIN-1835-2,405.494

by degrees it became a little damper ; DARWIN-1835-2,405.495

then puddles of water were formed ; DARWIN-1835-2,405.496

these soon became connected , DARWIN-1835-2,405.497

and at Villa Vicencio there was a nice little rivulet .
DARWIN-1835-2,405.498

30th . DARWIN-1835-2,405.499

- The solitary hovel which bears the imposing name of Villa Vicencio ,
has been mentioned by every traveller who has crossed the Andes .
DARWIN-1835-2,405.500

I staid here , and at some neighbouring mines , during the two
succeeding days . DARWIN-1835-2,405.501

The geology of the surrounding country is very curious .
DARWIN-1835-2,405.502

The Uspallata range is separated from the true Cordillera by a long
narrow plain or basin , like those so often mentioned in Chile , but
with an altitude of about six_thousand feet . DARWIN-1835-2,405.503

The range consists of various kinds of submarine lava , alternating with
volcanic sandstones and other remarkable sedimentary deposits ; the
whole having a very close resemblance to some of <P_406> the newer
horizontal beds on the shores of the Pacific . DARWIN-1835-2,406.504

From this resemblance I expected to find silicified wood , which is
generally characteristic of those formations . DARWIN-1835-2,406.505

I was gratified in a very extraordinary manner . DARWIN-1835-2,406.506

In the central part of the range , at an elevation probably of
seven_thousand feet , on a bare slope , I observed some snow-white
projecting columns . DARWIN-1835-2,406.507

These were petrified trees , eleven being silicified , and from thirty
to forty converted into coarsely-@ @crystallized white calcareous spar .
DARWIN-1835-2,406.508

They were abruptly broken off ; the upright stumps projecting a few feet
above the ground . DARWIN-1835-2,406.509

The trunks measured from three to five feet each in circumference .
DARWIN-1835-2,406.510

They stood a little way apart from each other , DARWIN-1835-2,406.511

but the whole formed one distinct group . DARWIN-1835-2,406.512

Mr. Robert Brown has been kind enough to examine the wood :
DARWIN-1835-2,406.513

he says it is coniferous , and that it partakes of the character of the
Araucarian tribe <paren> to which the common South_Chilian pine belongs
<$$paren> , but with some curious points of affinity with the yew .
DARWIN-1835-2,406.514

The volcanic sandstone in which they were embedded , and from the lower
part of which they must have sprung , had accumulated in successive thin
layers around their trunks ; DARWIN-1835-2,406.515

and the stone yet retained the impression of the bark .
DARWIN-1835-2,406.516

It required little geological practice to interpret the marvellous story
, which this scene at once unfolded ; though I confess I was at first so
much astonished that I could scarcely believe the plainest evidence of
it . DARWIN-1835-2,406.517

I saw the spot where a cluster of fine trees had once waved their
branches on the shores of the Atlantic , when that ocean <paren> now
driven back 700 miles <$$paren> approached the base of the Andes .
DARWIN-1835-2,406.518

I saw that they had sprung from a volcanic soil which had been raised
above the level of the sea , and that this dry land , with its upright
trees , had subsequently been let down to the depths of the ocean .
DARWIN-1835-2,406.519

There it was covered by sedimentary matter , and this again by enormous
streams of submarine lava - one such mass alone attaining the thickness
of a_thousand feet ; DARWIN-1835-2,406.520

and " these deluges of melted stone and aqueous deposits had been five
times spread out alternately . DARWIN-1835-2,406.521

The ocean which received such masses must have been deep ;
DARWIN-1835-2,406.522

but again the subterranean <P_407> forces exerted their power ,
DARWIN-1835-2,407.523

and I now beheld the bed of that sea forming a chain of mountains more
than seven_thousand feet in altitude . DARWIN-1835-2,407.524

Nor had those antagonist forces been dormant , which are always at work
to wear down the surface of the land to one level :
DARWIN-1835-2,407.525

the great piles of strata had been intersected by many wide valleys ;
DARWIN-1835-2,407.526

and the trees now changed into silex were exposed projecting from the
volcanic soil now changed into rock , whence formerly in a green and
budding state they had raised their lofty heads . DARWIN-1835-2,407.527

Now , all is utterly irreclaimable and desert ; DARWIN-1835-2,407.528

even the lichen can@ @not adhere to the stony casts of former trees .
DARWIN-1835-2,407.529

Vast , and scarcely comprehensible as such changes must ever appear ,
yet they have all occurred within a period recent when compared with the
history of the Cordillera ; DARWIN-1835-2,407.530

and that Cordillera itself is modern as compared with some other of the
fossiliferous strata of South America . DARWIN-1835-2,407.531

April 1st . DARWIN-1835-2,407.532

- We crossed the Uspallata range ; DARWIN-1835-2,407.533

and at night slept at the custom-house the only inhabited spot on the
plain . DARWIN-1835-2,407.534

Shortly before leaving the mountains , there was a very extraordinary
view : DARWIN-1835-2,407.535

red , purple , green , and quite white sedimentary rocks , alternating
with black lavas , were broken up and thrown into all kinds of disorder
, by masses of porphyry , of every shade , from dark brown to the
brightest lilac . DARWIN-1835-2,407.536

It was the first view I ever saw , which really resembled those pretty
sections which geologists make of the inside of the earth .
DARWIN-1835-2,407.537

The next day we crossed the plain , DARWIN-1835-2,407.538

and followed the course of the same great mountain stream which flows by
Luxan . DARWIN-1835-2,407.539

Here it was a furious torrent , quite impassable , and appearing larger
than in the low country ; as was the case with the rivulet of Villa
Vincencio . DARWIN-1835-2,407.540

On the evening of the succeeding day we reached the Rio de las Vacas ,
which is considered the worst stream in the Cordillera to cross .
DARWIN-1835-2,407.541

As all these rivers have a rapid and short course , and are due to the
snow melted by the sun's heat , the hour of the day makes a considerable
difference in their volume . DARWIN-1835-2,407.542

In the evening the stream is muddy and full , DARWIN-1835-2,407.543

but about daybreak it becomes both clearer and much less impetuous .
DARWIN-1835-2,407.544

<P_408>

This we found to be the case with the Rio Vacas , DARWIN-1835-2,408.546

and in the morning we crossed it with little difficulty .
DARWIN-1835-2,408.547

The scenery thus far was very uninteresting , compared with that of the
Portillo pass . DARWIN-1835-2,408.548

Little can be seen beyond the bare walls of the one grand ,
flat-bottomed valley , which the road follows up to the highest crest .
DARWIN-1835-2,408.549

The valley and the huge rocky mountains were extremely barren :
DARWIN-1835-2,408.550

during the two previous nights the poor mules had absolutely nothing to
eat ; DARWIN-1835-2,408.551

for excepting a few low resinous bushes , scarcely a plant could be seen
. DARWIN-1835-2,408.552

We went over in the course of this day some of the worst passes in the
Cordillera . DARWIN-1835-2,408.553

The degree of exaggeration concerning their danger and difficulty is
very great . DARWIN-1835-2,408.554

In Chile I was even told , that if I attempted to pass on foot my head
would turn giddy , that there was no room to dismount , &c ,
DARWIN-1835-2,408.555

but I did not see a place where any one might not have walked over
backwards , or got off his mule on either side . DARWIN-1835-2,408.556

One of the bad passes called <font> las Animas <$$font> <paren> the
Souls <$$paren> , I had crossed , DARWIN-1835-2,408.557

and did not find out till a day afterwards that it was one of the awful
dangers . DARWIN-1835-2,408.558

No doubt there are many parts in which , if the mule should stumble ,
the rider would be hurled down a great precipice ; DARWIN-1835-2,408.559

but of such a catastrophe there is much less chance than with a man on
foot . DARWIN-1835-2,408.560

I dare say , in the spring , the " laderas , " or roads , which each
year are formed anew across the piles of fallen detritus , are very bad
; DARWIN-1835-2,408.561

but from what I have seen , I suspect the real danger is nothing , and
the apparent very little . DARWIN-1835-2,408.562

With cargo mules the case is rather different ; DARWIN-1835-2,408.563

for the loads project so far , that the animals occasionally running
against each other , or against a point of rock , lose their balance and
are thrown down the precipice . DARWIN-1835-2,408.564

With regard to crossing the rivers , I can well believe that the
difficulty amounts to every degree , till they are impracticable .
DARWIN-1835-2,408.565

At this season there was little trouble , DARWIN-1835-2,408.566

but in the summer they must be very bad . DARWIN-1835-2,408.567

I can quite imagine , as Captain Head describes , the different
expressions of those who <font> have <$$font> passed the gulf , and
those who <font> are <$$font> passing . DARWIN-1835-2,408.568

I never heard of any man being drowned , DARWIN-1835-2,408.569

but with loaded mules this is of frequent <P_409> occurrence .
DARWIN-1835-2,409.570

The <font> arriero <$$font> tells you to show your mule the best line ,
and then allow her to cross as she chooses ; DARWIN-1835-2,409.571

the cargo mule takes a bad line , DARWIN-1835-2,409.572

and is often lost . DARWIN-1835-2,409.573

April 4th . DARWIN-1835-2,409.574

- From the Rio de las Vacas to the Puente del Inca , half a day's
journey . DARWIN-1835-2,409.575

As there was pasture for the mules , and geology for me , we bivouacked
for the night . DARWIN-1835-2,409.576

When one hears of a natural bridge , one pictures to oneself some deep
and narrow ravine , across which a bold mass of rock has fallen ; or a
great arch hollowed out like the vault of a cavern .
DARWIN-1835-2,409.577

Instead of this , the Inca's bridge consists of a crust of stratified
shingle , cemented together by the deposits of the neighbouring hot
springs . DARWIN-1835-2,409.578

It appears as if the stream had scooped out a channel on one side ,
leaving an overhanging ledge , which was at last met by the earth and
stones falling down from the opposite cliff . DARWIN-1835-2,409.579

Certainly an oblique junction , as would happen in such case , was very
distinct on one side . DARWIN-1835-2,409.580

The bridge of the Incas is by no means worthy of the great monarchs
whose name it bears . DARWIN-1835-2,409.581

Close by , there were some ruins of Indian buildings .
DARWIN-1835-2,409.582

These occur in several other places ; the most perfect , which I saw ,
being the Ruinas de Tambillos . DARWIN-1835-2,409.583

Small square rooms were there huddled together , but placed in distinct
groups . DARWIN-1835-2,409.584

Some of the doorways were yet standing : DARWIN-1835-2,409.585

they were formed by a cross slab of stone , but only raised about three
feet high . DARWIN-1835-2,409.586

Ulloa , in his " Noticias Americanas , " remarks on the lowness of the
doors in the ancient Peruvian dwellings . DARWIN-1835-2,409.587

These houses , when perfect , must have been capable of containing a
considerable number of persons . DARWIN-1835-2,409.588

Tradition says , they were used as halting-places for the Incas , when
they crossed these mountains . DARWIN-1835-2,409.589

Traces of Indian habitations have been discovered in many parts of the
Cordillera , where it does not appear probable , that they were
constructed as mere resting-places ; but yet where the land is as
utterly unfit for any kind of cultivation as it is near the Tambillos or
Puente del Inca . DARWIN-1835-2,409.590

In the Portillo pass I saw one group of such ruins .
DARWIN-1835-2,409.591

In the ravine of Jajuel , near Aconcagua , where there is no pass , I
heard of numerous remains situated <P_410> at a great elevation , where
it is both cold and extremely sterile . DARWIN-1835-2,410.592

At first I imagined , that these houses were places of refuge built by
the Indians on the first arrival of the Spaniards ;
DARWIN-1835-2,410.593

but subsequently I have been almost inclined to speculate on the
possibility of a small change of climate . DARWIN-1835-2,410.594

In the northern parts of Chile , within the Cordillera of Copiapo , old
Indian houses are found in very many parts : DARWIN-1835-2,410.595

by digging amongst the ruins , bits of woollen articles , instruments of
precious metals , and heads of Indian corn , are not unfrequently
discovered . DARWIN-1835-2,410.596

I had likewise in my possession the head of an arrow , made of agate ,
of precisely the same figure as those now used in Tierra del Fuego .

I am aware that the Peruvian Indians frequently inhabit most lofty and
bleak situations ; DARWIN-1835-2,410.598

but in these cases , I was assured by men , who had spent their lives in
travelling the Andes , that very many <font> <paren> muchisimas
<$$paren> <$$font> houses were found at elevations so great as almost to
border on the perpetual snow , and in parts where there exist no passes
, and where the land produces absolutely nothing , and what is still
more extraordinary , where there is no water . DARWIN-1835-2,410.599

Nevertheless it is the opinion of the people of the country <paren>
although they are much puzzled by the circumstance <$$paren> , that ,
from the appearance of the houses , the Indians must have used them as
places of residence . DARWIN-1835-2,410.600

In the Despoblado <paren> uninhabited valley <$$paren> , near Copiapó ,
at a spot called Punta Gorda , I saw the remains of seven or eight
square little rooms , which were of a similar form with those at the
Tambillos , but built chiefly of mud <paren> which the present
inhabitants can@ @not by any means imitate in durability <$$paren>
instead of with stone . DARWIN-1835-2,410.601
