Chap. IV . WYLD-1725-2,83.4

<font> Shewing how to Survey and make a perfect Draught of several
pieces of Land lying together as a Mannor <$$font> , &c. <$$font> Also
how to compare the Bearing and Angles one with another , at each Station
, as observ'd by the Theodolite , in order to correct any Error that may
arise in measuring the Angles in the Field as well as protracting them
on Paper . <$$font> WYLD-1725-2,83.5

Sect. I . WYLD-1725-2,83.6

<$$heading>

Having in the former Chapters laid down the best and most practical
Methods for measuring any Piece of land by the most proper Instruments ,
I here subjoin the manner of Surveying several Parcels lying together ;
an Example of which may be taken from the small Tenement or Farm ,
<font> Fig. <$$font> 22 . WYLD-1725-2,83.8

<P_84>

First I take a View of the Land , considering at which Part thereof it
will be most convenient to begin , and proceed with the Work ;
WYLD-1725-2,84.10

and because 't@ @is best working in a Lane as often as an Opportunity
presents ; therefore I set up the Theodolite at {COM:symbol_for_station}
1 in <font> Charlton <$$font> Field . WYLD-1725-2,84.11

Then I enter in the Field-Book the Title of the Survey , and in the
middle Column {COM:symbol_for_station} 1 , WYLD-1725-2,84.12

and then send a Station Staff forwards in the Lane , as far as I can see
distinctly , <paren> the farther the better <$$paren> as to
{COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , WYLD-1725-2,84.13

<paren> and when the Station Lines are within the Fields , I send the
Staff to the next eminent Bend in the Hedge , or even to the farther end
thereof , if the Line from the Instrument to the Staff be not at too
great a Distance from the Hedge , so as to cause Offsets greater than a
Chain or a Chain and half , or thereabouts , WYLD-1725-2,84.14

for Offsets taken too long are not so easily laid off at right Angles
from the Station Line <$$paren> WYLD-1725-2,84.15

and to that Staff at {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , I direct the Telescope
, WYLD-1725-2,84.16

and note the Degrees in the Box cut by the north End of the Needle ,
<font> viz. <$$font> 356 Degrees 10 Minutes , which I enter in the
Field-Book for the Bearing of this first Station Line .
WYLD-1725-2,84.17

Then I set up a Staff in the Hole over which the Center of the
Instrument was plac'd , to which Staff I direct one of my Assistants to
apply the Ring at one End of the Chain , whilst the other Assistant
stretches it out in a right Line towards {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 ,
letting it lye on the Ground in that Direction ; till the Occurrences in
this Chain's Length are entred in the Field-Book , WYLD-1725-2,84.18

<font> viz. <$$font> I measure the Distances of the Chain from the
Bounders of each Field , which I enter in the Columns of Offsets , that
on the right Hand of the Chain in the right-Hand Column , and that on
the left in the left-Hand Column ; WYLD-1725-2,84.19

and if the Land is Part of that which I am about to survey , I write in
one <P_85> of the outside Columns by what Name it is call'd ,
WYLD-1725-2,85.20

but if it belongs to a Stranger , I write the name of the Owner thereof
, WYLD-1725-2,85.21

and in all Cases express to which Land the Hedge belongs .
WYLD-1725-2,85.22

So at the Length of 20 Links from {COM:symbol_for_station} 1 , I lay the
Offset Staff at right Angles with the Chain , WYLD-1725-2,85.23

and measure the Distance from thence to the corner of Turfy Leas , which
I find to be 15 Links ; WYLD-1725-2,85.24

therefore in the middle Column representing the Station Line I write 20
, WYLD-1725-2,85.25

and against it in the right Hand Column of Offsets I enter 15 ;
WYLD-1725-2,85.26

likewise when I come to 40 Links in the Chain-Line I am against the
Corner of Cow-pasture ; WYLD-1725-2,85.27

therefore , I lay the Offset Staff to the Chain , WYLD-1725-2,85.28

and measure the Distance from thence to the Corner of Cow-pasture 80
Links , which I enter in the left-Hand Column of Offsets against 20 in
the middle Column , denoting that at the Length of 40 Links from
{COM:symbol_for_station} 1 the Offset , 80 Links reached the Corner of
Cow-pasture on the left Side of the Station-Line . WYLD-1725-2,85.29

The Hedges on each side the Lane , running on very nearly strait from
these Corners , I take no more Offsets in this first Chain's Length nor
at the second ; WYLD-1725-2,85.30

but when I have laid the Chain a third time , and come against 80 Links
, I there take an Offset on the left Hand of the Chain Line , because
the Hedge varies its Direction , making a considerable Bend ;
WYLD-1725-2,85.31

for though the Distance from the Chain to the Hedge continually varies
from the Corner to this Place ; yet I only take Offsets at each End ,
omitting the intermediate Parts ; since when the extreams of a right
Line are given , that right Line is also given , WYLD-1725-2,85.32

but when the Hedge runs on with a continued but irregular Curvature
{TEXT:Curviture} , then I take Offsets at every Chain or half Chain@ @'s
Length , or oftner as the Thing requires . WYLD-1725-2,85.33

<P_86>

In this manner I proceed with the Chain till I come to the Staff at
{COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , observing as I go along the Bends in the
Fences on each side of the Lane , to every one of which I take an Offset
, writing the Length of each on the right or left side of the middle
Column in the Field-Book representing the Station Line , according as
they were laid off in the Field . WYLD-1725-2,86.35

<font> Note <$$font> , the Mark {COM:symbol_for_station} in the
Field-Book denotes a Station ; <font> B <$$font> a Bearing ,
{COM:symbol_for_angle} an Angle , <font> cu. <$$font> the cutting of an
Hedge by the Chain , <font> a g <$$font> , some remarkable Object on the
farther side of the Hedge , as another Fence shooting up thereto ;
<font> ret. <$$font> return to a former Station , <font> &c. <$$font>
WYLD-1725-2,86.36

Being come to {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , I there plant the Instrument
, WYLD-1725-2,86.37

and send the Station Staff forwards in the Lane as far as I can see it ,
as to {COM:symbol_for_station} 3 , WYLD-1725-2,86.38

and then bring the Index to 360 on the Limb , WYLD-1725-2,86.39

and turning the whole Instrument about I direct the Telescope to the
Staff left at {COM:symbol_for_station} 1 , WYLD-1725-2,86.40

and there fix the Instrument ; WYLD-1725-2,86.41

and then turn about the Index on the Limb , till through the Telescope I
see the Staff at {COM:symbol_for_station} 3 , WYLD-1725-2,86.42

and then find that the north End of the Needle points at 338 Degrees ,
and the Index cuts on the Limb 161 Degrees 50 Minutes ;
WYLD-1725-2,86.43

therefore under {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , in the middle Column of the
Field-Book , I enter 338 Degrees , and under that 161 Degrees 50 Minutes
, denoting that at the second Station the Bearing of the second Length
is 338 Degrees , and the Angle which the Index cuts on the Limb is 161
Degrees 50 Minutes . WYLD-1725-2,86.44

The Rule I observe in measuring each Angle is this ; WYLD-1725-2,86.45

first I bring the Index to 360 , WYLD-1725-2,86.46

and with that part of the Limb towards me , I direct the Telescope to a
Mark at the last Station , WYLD-1725-2,86.47

and there fix the Instrument ; WYLD-1725-2,86.48

then I turn about the <P_87> Index on the Limb , till I see the Hair in
the Telescope {TEXT:Tellescope} cut a Mark at the next Station before me
, WYLD-1725-2,87.49

so shall the Needle shew the Bearing of the next Line ,
WYLD-1725-2,87.50

and the Index on the Limb shews the Quantity of the Angle at the present
Station . WYLD-1725-2,87.51

The Angles and Bearings of the Lines are taken at once setting the Index
, as easily and expeditiously as the Angle it self only ;
WYLD-1725-2,87.52

therefore insert the Bearing of each Line in the Field-Book , as you see
in the Form thereof ; WYLD-1725-2,87.53

for then you may prove the Truth of your Work in the Field at each
Station , before you leave it , by one of the following Rules .
WYLD-1725-2,87.54

If to the present Bearing , be added 180 Degrees , and from the Sum you
subtract the last Bearing , then the Remainder will be the present Angle
. WYLD-1725-2,87.55

Or if to the present Angle , you add the last Bearing , and from the Sum
subtract 180 , then will the Remainder be the present Bearing .
WYLD-1725-2,87.56

But if the Degrees to be subtracted are more than those from which they
are to be subtracted , the latter must be encreased by 360 ,
WYLD-1725-2,87.57

and then subtract . WYLD-1725-2,87.58

And if the Remainder be more than 360 , then abate 360 ,
WYLD-1725-2,87.59

and the Result gives the Degrees required . WYLD-1725-2,87.60

So at {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , if to the present Bearing 338 00 ' ,
you add 180@ @=o= , the Sum is 518@ @=o= , 00 ' from which Sum , if you
subtract the last Bearing at 1 , 356@ @=o= 10 ' , the Remainder is 161@
@=o= 50 equal to the present Angle . WYLD-1725-2,87.61

Likewise , if to the Bearing at {COM:symbol_for_station} 3 1@ @=o= 30 '
, you add 180 Degrees , the Sum is 181@ @=o= 30 ' , which is less than
33800 ' , the Bearing of the last Station , WYLD-1725-2,87.62

therefore 181@ @=o= 30 ' must be encreased by 360 , WYLD-1725-2,87.63

and then the Sum is 541@ @=o= 30 ' , from which if you subtract 338 ,
the Bearing of the last Station , the Remainder will be 203@ @=o= 30 ' ,
equal to the present Angle . WYLD-1725-2,87.64

In like Manner may any other Angles be examined , WYLD-1725-2,87.65

and if found erroneous , the Error may <P_88> be corrected , before 't@
@is communicated to the following Part of the Work . WYLD-1725-2,88.66

Therefore when you have noted the Bearing of the present Station , write
it in one of the outside Columns of the Field-Book , WYLD-1725-2,88.67

and adding 180 thereto , subtract the Bearing at the last Station
there-from ; WYLD-1725-2,88.68

and then , if the Angle thus calculated from the Bearings , doth agree
with that which the Index cuts on the Limb , you may conclude the Angle
is rightly observed , and therefore may be entred in the Field-Book .
WYLD-1725-2,88.69

But observe , tho' the Numbers thus compared will be very nearly alike ,
yet sometimes they may differ some few Minutes , because the Divisions
in the Box being so much smaller than those on the Limb , the Degrees
and Minutes ca@ @n't be estimated alike in both ; WYLD-1725-2,88.70

but yet you will be sure always to correct and avoid any gross Error
before you proceed with the following Work ; WYLD-1725-2,88.71

and to this End the before-mentioned Rules are of excellent Use .
WYLD-1725-2,88.72

These Directions I shall not repeat , tho' I make Use of them throughout
the whole Work , unless any thing new occurs in measuring of the other
Lines and Angles , referring the Reader rather to the Field-Book and
Plan of the Work , than tiring him with Repetitions . WYLD-1725-2,88.73

From {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 : I proceed with the Chain towards
{COM:symbol_for_station} 3 : WYLD-1725-2,88.74

but at twenty Links in the first Length from {COM:symbol_for_station} 2
, I am against the Hedge that parts Home-close from Turfy-Leas ;
WYLD-1725-2,88.75

therefore I take an Offset thereto perpendicular from the Chain Line ,
WYLD-1725-2,88.76

and enter in the Field-Book <font> a g <$$font> 17 Links ,
WYLD-1725-2,88.77

and this will hereafter be of Use in closing the Plott .
WYLD-1725-2,88.78

Being come to {COM:symbol_for_station} 3 , I there observe and prove the
bearing and Angle at that Station , WYLD-1725-2,88.79

and then proceed with the Chain towards {COM:symbol_for_station} 4 ;
WYLD-1725-2,88.80

but first at <P_89> {COM:symbol_for_station} or the present Station , I
measure an Offset to the right 10 Links , and to the left 20 Links ; at
41 in the Chain Line ; WYLD-1725-2,89.81

I am against the Orchard Hedge at 204 , the Orchard Pales at 261 ,
WYLD-1725-2,89.82

I am against the Gate that leads into the Yard , and also against
another that goes into Cow-Pasture ; WYLD-1725-2,89.83

therefore to each of these Remarks I measure an Offset from the Chain
Line , WYLD-1725-2,89.84

and enter them in the Field-Book . WYLD-1725-2,89.85

In going from {COM:symbol_for_station} 4 to {COM:symbol_for_station} 5 ,
the Chain touches the Brow of the Ditch at 2 Chain 20 Links from the
last Station ; WYLD-1725-2,89.86

therefore against 220 in the Field-Book I write <font> <$$font> ,
denoting that there was <font> <$$font> or no Distance from the Chain to
the Ditch , WYLD-1725-2,89.87

and by the Brow of the Ditch is meant the determined Distance of 5 Links
from the Stem of the Hedge . WYLD-1725-2,89.88

Being come to {COM:symbol_for_station} 6 , I send a Staff to the farther
Side of the Field called the Stockin , WYLD-1725-2,89.89

and if I can@ @not see the Mark through the Hedge , I cause the Bows to
be removed or held back till I can plainly see the Mark ,
WYLD-1725-2,89.90

and if that ca@ @n't be done I make my Station a little on this Side ,
or else beyond such a thick Place till I can plainly see the Mark ,
WYLD-1725-2,89.91

and draw the Chain through the Hedge in a strait Line ,
WYLD-1725-2,89.92

and where it cuts the Hedge I write <font> cut <$$font> , as here it
does at 10 Links ; WYLD-1725-2,89.93

but if the Fence is a Wall I allow for the Thickness thereof ,
WYLD-1725-2,89.94

and always measure the nearest Distance between Station and Station that
can possibly be . WYLD-1725-2,89.95

Being come to {COM:symbol_for_station} 9 in the Stockin , I cause a
Staff to be set up in the very Corner of the Field next the Lane where
the Bounders meet , to which I measure from {COM:symbol_for_station} 9 ;
WYLD-1725-2,89.96

so shall the End of this Line coincide with the Offset which I took to
this corner from the Station Line in the Lane , which
{COM:copies_of_pages_86_to_89_omitted} <P_90> will be a Proof that the
Work is truly laid down when I come to protract it . WYLD-1725-2,90.97

If upon a Piece of Paper with the Pen only you make an Eye-Draught of
the Lane , and that Field which you have finished , setting your Station
Lines with their Numbers , as you made them in the Field , you will
plainly see your Work as you go along , and be able to distinguish which
Bounders of the present Field are already observed in the Precedent , as
well as be directed , with a great deal of Ease , how to proceed with
your Work , when you come to protract it . WYLD-1725-2,90.98

Having made all the necessary Observations round the <font> Stockin
<$$font> , I return to {COM:symbol_for_station} 9 , WYLD-1725-2,90.99

and with 360 on the Limb towards me I direct the Telescope
{TEXT:Tellescope} to a Mark , at the last Station before I came to this
, <font> viz. <$$font> {COM:symbol_for_station} 8 , WYLD-1725-2,90.100

and fixing the Instrument there , I next direct the Telescope
{TEXT:Tellescope} to 10 , WYLD-1725-2,90.101

and note the Angle and Bearing at that Station ; WYLD-1725-2,90.102

then I lay the Chain through the Hedge from {COM:symbol_for_station} 9
towards {COM:symbol_for_station} 10 , WYLD-1725-2,90.103

and take an Offset to the Fence where each Partition Line joins it on
the other Side , by the Help of which , together with the other Offsets
on the further Side in the Lane , most of the inward Fences of the
Orchard , Garden <font> &c. <$$font> may be drawn . WYLD-1725-2,90.104

From {COM:symbol_for_station} 10 I can@ @not see into the very Corner
next the Lane , WYLD-1725-2,90.105

therefore I take an Offset thereto 20 Links from the Station Line ,
WYLD-1725-2,90.106

and so are the out_Lines of the Garden , Yard , <font> &c. <$$font>
finished . WYLD-1725-2,90.107

Then I return to {COM:symbol_for_station} 8 in the <font> Stockin
<$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,90.108

and here it may be observed , that when I design to return to any
Station , before I leave it I cut up a Turf with a little Paddle , which
I fix in one End of the Offset-Staff , or make some such Remark that I
may be sure readily to find the Place in which the Station Staff before
stood ; and in the Field-Book to this Mark {COM:symbol_for_station} I
write return ; WYLD-1725-2,90.109

then planting the Instrument at {COM:symbol_for_station} 8 , I direct
the Telescope {TEXT:Tellescope} <P_91> to the Mark left at
{COM:symbol_for_station} 7 , WYLD-1725-2,91.110

and here also I observe as a general Law , to observe the Angle with
that Line which was measured immediately before I came to the Station
where I took the Angle the first time : WYLD-1725-2,91.111

So here I observe the Angle made with {COM:symbol_for_station} 7 ,
{COM:symbol_for_station} 8 , and not with any other , as
{COM:symbol_for_station} 8 , {COM:symbol_for_station} 9 ;
WYLD-1725-2,91.112

therefore according to this constant Law I direct the Telescope
{TEXT:Tellescope} back to {COM:symbol_for_station} 7 in the <font>
Stockin <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,91.113

and fixing the Instrument there , I next direct the Telescope
{TEXT:Tellescope} to {COM:symbol_for_station} 11 , in <font> Home-Close
<$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,91.114

and <font> Note <$$font> the Angle , <font> &c. <$$font> as in the
Field-Book . WYLD-1725-2,91.115

After I have measured the Angle <font> &c. <$$font> at
{COM:symbol_for_station} 11 , and am going forwards towards
{COM:symbol_for_station} 12 , at 76 Links of the Chain I perceive my
self over against the Fence that parts <font> Out-Wood <$$font> from
<font> Crab-tree-Close <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,91.116

I therefore ask the Follower of the Chain , how many Arrows he hath in
his Hand , WYLD-1725-2,91.117

he answers 4 , WYLD-1725-2,91.118

therefore I enter in the middle Column of the Field-Book 476 ,
WYLD-1725-2,91.119

and against that on the left I write 61 , the Length of the Offset ,
denoting , that at the Length of 4 Chains 76 links from
{COM:symbol_for_station} 11 , I laid off an Offset to the left , 61
Links , WYLD-1725-2,91.120

and proceed to observe and enter in the Field-Book the rest of the
Occurrences round <font> Home-Close <$$font> , closing it at the End of
the Line from {COM:symbol_for_station} 12 next the Lane .
WYLD-1725-2,91.121

Then I return to {COM:symbol_for_station} 12 , WYLD-1725-2,91.122

and proceed to {COM:symbol_for_station} 13 , closing <font> Turfey-Leas
<$$font> at the Corner ; to which I took the first Offset {TEXT:Offsett}
from {COM:symbol_for_station} 1 , in Charlton-Field .
WYLD-1725-2,91.123

In the same Manner I proceed round <font> Crabtree-Close <$$font> ,
entring the several Occurrences as you find them in the Field-Book .
WYLD-1725-2,91.124

At {COM:symbol_for_station} 17 , I cause a Staff to be set up close to
the Fence where the Hedges join one another ; to which Staff I measure
strait from {COM:symbol_for_station} 17 , closing <font> Outwood
<$$font> at the Extremity of the Station-Line , which coincides with the
Offset {TEXT:Offset} laid off from {COM:symbol_for_station} 7 , in the
<font> Stockin . <$$font> WYLD-1725-2,91.125

<P_92>

Having finished all the Fields on this Side the Lane , I return to
{COM:symbol_for_station} 6 , observing this general Rule , never to make
a Tour greater than Necessity requires , but always to close each Field
as soon as possible : WYLD-1725-2,92.127

So instead of going up the <font> Lane <$$font> from
{COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , if I had turned off into <font> Turfy-Leas
<$$font> , and closed first <font> Turfy-Leas <$$font> , and then <font>
Crabtree-Close , &c. <$$font> the Work had been done as well .
WYLD-1725-2,92.128

Being at {COM:symbol_for_station} 6 , I cause a Staff to be set up in a
convenient Place , on the farther Side of <font> Garrot-Field <$$font> ,
as at {COM:symbol_for_station} 18 , laying the Chain through the Hedge ,
from {COM:symbol_for_station} 6 , towards {COM:symbol_for_station} 18 ;
WYLD-1725-2,92.129

and because the Hedge belongs to the next Field , I write Hedge to
<font> Will. Green <$$font> , the Owner of the adjacent Land .
WYLD-1725-2,92.130

After I have observed the Angle at {COM:symbol_for_station} 18 , I
direct the Telescope {TEXT:Tellescope} to a Staff set up by the River
Side , WYLD-1725-2,92.131

and note the Degrees which the Index cuts on the Limb , <font> viz.
<$$font> 131@ @=o= 10 ' ; WYLD-1725-2,92.132

and then measure from {COM:symbol_for_station} 18 , to that Staff , 300
Links , taking Offsets on each Side the Line to the Brink of the River ,
as you see in the Figure thereof ; WYLD-1725-2,92.133

and this will be found very useful in all Manner of Practice , where the
Bounders are very irregular , that as much Work may be performed at once
setting down the Instrument as possible . WYLD-1725-2,92.134

From {COM:symbol_for_station} 18 , I proceed with the Chain to
{COM:symbol_for_station} 19 , WYLD-1725-2,92.135

and from thence I measure along the Hedge-side that reaches from the
<font> River <$$font> to the <font> Lane <$$font> ; WYLD-1725-2,92.136

and when I come against the Hedge that parts <font> Magg-meadow <$$font>
from <font> Cow-pasture <$$font> , I write , <font> a g. <$$font> 50
Links , being so far distant from the Chain-Line ; WYLD-1725-2,92.137

and because the Hedge from this Place belonged to <font> Garrott-Field
<$$font> , I entred it so in the Field-Book , WYLD-1725-2,92.138

but now it belongs to <font> Cow-pasture <$$font> ; WYLD-1725-2,92.139

therefore I write <font> Hedge <$$font> to <font> Cow-pasture .
<$$font> WYLD-1725-2,92.140

Then returning to {COM:symbol_for_station} 19 , I direct the Telescope
first to {COM:symbol_for_station} 18 , and then to
{COM:symbol_for_station} 20 , WYLD-1725-2,92.141

and find <P_93> {COM:symbol_for_station} 19 to be in a strait Line with
{COM:symbol_for_station} 18 and {COM:symbol_for_station} 20 ;
WYLD-1725-2,93.142

therefore I enter in the Field-Book 180 , or Station-Line continued ,
proceeding to observe and enter down the several Occurrences at
{COM:symbol_for_station} 20 , {COM:symbol_for_station} 21 , and
{COM:symbol_for_station} 22 , round <font> Magg-meadow <$$font> ,
WYLD-1725-2,93.143

and then return to {COM:symbol_for_station} 21 . WYLD-1725-2,93.144

From {COM:symbol_for_station} 21 , I go to {COM:symbol_for_station} 23
in <font> Cow-pasture <$$font> , closing it on the Corner , near
{COM:symbol_for_station} 1 in <font> Charlton-Field <$$font>
{COM:font_change_around_"Charlton"} ; WYLD-1725-2,93.145

and so is the whole finished , as far as relates to the Field-work .
WYLD-1725-2,93.146

If there be several Pieces of Land belonging to the same Manor , <font>
&c. <$$font> you are now surveying , that lie dispersed in several
Furlongs in Common Fields adjacent to the same Manor ; you may from one
of your Stations on the Outside of the Plot take the Bearings to each
Piece , by causing a Mark to be set up thereon , and measuring the
Distance from that Station to each Mark : WYLD-1725-2,93.147

So may each Piece be plotted in its true Form , and laid in the same
Situation in the Plot as on the Land it self : WYLD-1725-2,93.148

And in your Table of References or Terrier , you may insert the Name of
the Furlong where each Piece lies , with the Name of other Persons Land
that lies round it , as a Direction to the Steward or other Person , to
find each Piece . WYLD-1725-2,93.149

Sect. II . WYLD-1725-2,104.153

<$$heading>

<font> The manner of Protracting the Observations contained in the
preceding Field-Book . <$$font> WYLD-1725-2,104.155

The Protractor for this Purpose is best made a whole Circle , and marked
on the Limb where the Numbers begin with <font> N. <$$font> or a <font>
Flower-de-luce <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,104.156

for then may that Part of the Protractor be kept always one Way as the
Instrument in the Field , WYLD-1725-2,104.157

and therefore you will be less liable to mistake , than if you use a
Semicircle , which must be laid upwards or downwards , as the Degrees of
the Bearing are more or less than 180 ; WYLD-1725-2,104.158

and the Diameter of this Protractor is laid Parallel to the Meridians ,
by the Help of equal Divisions graved on the Protractor .
WYLD-1725-2,104.159

Being provided with a Sheet of strong Cartridge-Paper , or <paren> if
that is not large enough <$$paren> a Skin of Parchment ; or which I
reckon better <paren> especially for the fair Plott <$$paren> if one
Sheet of Paper be not big enough , to have several Sheets pasted on
Cloth or Canvas well stretched and dried in a Frame before you use it ;
WYLD-1725-2,104.160

and this you may have of any Size , as the Largeness of the Work to be
laid down requires . WYLD-1725-2,104.161

Or a Practiser may have Sheets of large Paper printed from a
Copper-plate , with fine Meridian-Lines drawn thereon at exact Distances
, WYLD-1725-2,104.162

and these will be very neat and true , WYLD-1725-2,104.163

and will save much Trouble in drawing Meridian-Lines by a Parallel Ruler
, or otherwise . WYLD-1725-2,104.164

If you have not a Parallel Ruler , you may draw Lines parallel to one
another , by setting one Foot of a Pair of Compasses at or near the End
of your given right Line , and with the other describe the Arch of a
Circle ; WYLD-1725-2,104.165

do the same at <P_105> the other End of the Line , WYLD-1725-2,105.166

and through the utmost Convex of these Two Arches you may draw a Line
Parallel to the first . WYLD-1725-2,105.167

Having drawn Parallel Right Lines at convenient Distances throughout the
Paper marked with N. S. representing Meridian , or North and South
Lines , I pick out some Place in one of these Lines , to represent the
first Station , as at {COM:symbol_for_station} 1 , Fig. 22 ,
WYLD-1725-2,105.168

and lay the Center of the Protractor on the Point
{COM:symbol_for_station} 1 , the Diameter being Parallel to the Meridian
Line , and the Beginning of the Degrees of the Protractor towards N. or
upwards ; WYLD-1725-2,105.169

and because the Bearing of the first Station Line is 356@ @=o= , 10 , I
make a Mark with my Protracting Pin against that Number , close to the
Limb of the Protractor , to which Mark I draw an obscure Line from
{COM:symbol_for_station} 1 , representing the Chain Line from
{COM:symbol_for_station} 1 , to {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 .
WYLD-1725-2,105.170

Then the Field-Book being open before me , I lay the Edge of my
Plotting-Scale to this obscure Line {COM:symbol_for_station} 1 and
{COM:symbol_for_station} 2 ; WYLD-1725-2,105.171

and because I find in the Field-book that the Offsets from this Line
were laid off at 20 , 40 , 280 , 300 , and 563 ; therefore making the
Beginning of the Numbers on the Plotting-Scale to coincide with
{COM:symbol_for_station} 1 , I make a Prick against each of these
Numbers , close to the Edge of the Plotting-Scale ; WYLD-1725-2,105.172

and then turning the Scale perpendicular to the Line , I apply it
successively to those several Points , WYLD-1725-2,105.173

and there prick off the Length of the several Offsets on the respective
Sides of the obscure Line ; WYLD-1725-2,105.174

so against the first Mark in the obscure Line , I prick off 15 Links to
the Right , which gives the Corner of <font> Turfy-Leas <$$font> :
WYLD-1725-2,105.175

Also against the second Prick in the obscure Line , I prick off 80 Links
to the Left , which give the Corner of <font> Cow-pasture <$$font> ;
WYLD-1725-2,105.176

at 280 , or the Third Mark in the obscure Line , I prick off 10 to the
Left ; at 300 , 20 to the Right ; WYLD-1725-2,105.177

<P_106>

and at the End of the Line 563 I prick off 18 Links to the Left :
WYLD-1725-2,106.179

Lastly , I draw Lines with Ink from Point to Point on the Outsides of
this obscure Line , thereby constituting the Bounders of the <font> Lane
<$$font> so far . WYLD-1725-2,106.180

At the first and second Distances , I was against the Corners of <font>
Turfey-Leas <$$font> and <font> Cow-pasture <$$font> ;
WYLD-1725-2,106.181

therefore , with a Black-lead Pencil I draw Two short Lines , cutting
the <font> Lane <$$font> , to denote that the <font> South <$$font>
Fences come up to the <font> Lane <$$font> at those Corners , and will
hereafter be of Use in closing these Plots . WYLD-1725-2,106.182

Having thus finished my first Length , I produce the obscure Line , if
Occasion requires , both Ways , till it is as long each Way as the
Radius of the Protractor ; WYLD-1725-2,106.183

then I place the Center of the Protractor on the Point
{COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , WYLD-1725-2,106.184

and turn it about thereon , keeping the Beginning of the Degrees towards
{COM:symbol_for_station} 1 ; the last Station ; till the Diameter
coincides with the Station-Line {COM:symbol_for_station} 1 ,
{COM:symbol_for_station} 2 ; WYLD-1725-2,106.185

then close to the Edge of the Protractor , right against 161@ @=o= 50 '
, the Degrees of the present Angle , I make a Mark with my
Protracting-Pin ; WYLD-1725-2,106.186

and to that Mark from {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , draw an obscure Line
, representing the Station-Line , from {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , to
{COM:symbol_for_station} 3 . WYLD-1725-2,106.187

And that I may be sure the Line {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 ,
{COM:symbol_for_station} 3 , is drawn in its true Position , I turn
about the Protractor , the Center still coinciding with
{COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , till the Diameter be Parallel with the
Meridians ; the Beginning of the Numbers of the Protractor being towards
N. on the Meridian WYLD-1725-2,106.188

and then will the Line {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 ,
{COM:symbol_for_station} 3 , before drawn , meet the Limb of the
Protractor against 338@ @=o= , 00 ' , the Bearing of the Line
{COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , {COM:symbol_for_station} 3 , which proves
the Line {COM:symbol_for_station} 2 , {COM:symbol_for_station} 3 , to be
truly laid down . WYLD-1725-2,106.189

And thus may the Plott be laid down by the Angles , and examined by the
Bearings . WYLD-1725-2,106.190

<P_107>

The constant Rule I observe in drawing the Angles is this : To lay the
Diameter of the Protractor on that Line which brought me to the present
Station , where the Angle about to be laid down , was taken ; and to
keep the Beginning of the Numbers on the Protractor towards the last
Station . WYLD-1725-2,107.192

And in Order to prove that each Angle is truly laid down , I turn about
the Center of the Protractor on the Point ; representing the present
Station , till the Diameter be parallel to the Meridians , with the
Beginning of the Numbers towards N. on the Meridian-Line ;
WYLD-1725-2,107.193

then will the Line last drawn , cut the Number , expressing its Bearing
on the Limb of the Protractor , if that Line be drawn in its true
Position . WYLD-1725-2,107.194

In like Manner , I lay down and prove the Angles taken at the 3d , 4th ,
5th , 6th , 7th , 8th and 9th Stations ; and also the corresponding
Lengths and Occurrences , continuing the Bounders to the several Offsets
as I go along , drawing a short Line across them with a Black-lead
Pencil , where the Remarks <font> a <$$font> , <font> g <$$font> ,
<font> &c. <$$font> are noted in the Field-book , breaking off the
Fences where there are Gates : So at the last Length , from
{COM:symbol_for_station} 9 , when I have drawn that Line in its true
Position , and made it of its just Length , as noted in the Field-book ,
I find its Extremity to coincide with that Point in the Fence , to which
I laid off an Offset from 388 in the Station-Line
{COM:symbol_for_station} 3 , {COM:symbol_for_station} 4 , in the <font>
Lane <$$font> , which proves that the Angles and Lengths enclosing the
<font> Stockin <$$font> , are truly laid down . WYLD-1725-2,107.195

But if the Extremity of the last Line does not coincide with the
Extremity of the last Offset laid off from the Station-Line
{COM:symbol_for_station} 3 , {COM:symbol_for_station} 4 , both denoting
the North-west Corner of the <font> Stockin <$$font> , the Lines and
Angles designed to enclose the same <P_108> <font> Stockin <$$font> ,
are not truly laid down , WYLD-1725-2,108.196

and therefore must be corrected before I proceed . WYLD-1725-2,108.197

Next I lay the Protractor on {COM:symbol_for_station} 9 , the Diameter
coincident with the Line {COM:symbol_for_station} 8 ,
{COM:symbol_for_station} 9 , being the same Line which brought me to
that Station ; WYLD-1725-2,108.198

and having laid down the Angle , {COM:symbol_for_station} 8 ,
{COM:symbol_for_station} 9 , {COM:symbol_for_station} 10 , I prick off
the several Offsets , marking them as the Field-book directs , where the
Lines of Partition within come up to the Hedge . WYLD-1725-2,108.199

Having drawn the Chain-Line from {COM:symbol_for_station} 10 , and set
off the last Offset therefrom 20 Links , I find the Extremity of that
Offset to coincide with the Mark I drew cross the Fence at the 2d Offset
from {COM:symbol_for_station} 3 , which proves the Work to be truly laid
down . WYLD-1725-2,108.200

The Out-Lines round the Orchard , Garden , Yard , <font> &c. <$$font>
being drawn , the Angles within , about the Buildings , may be measured
with a Bevel ; or else with the Chain only , <paren> as directed in the
Use of the Chain <$$paren> which , together with the Remarks on the
Outsides , will be an easy Direction for drawing the several Bounders
within those Lines . WYLD-1725-2,108.201

Having finished the Ground-plot about the Buildings , I find the next
Station in my Field-book , marked {COM:symbol_for_station} 8 . <font>
ret. <$$font> WYLD-1725-2,108.202

therefore I return to {COM:symbol_for_station} 8 , in my Draught ,
WYLD-1725-2,108.203

and lay down that Angle by the Line immediately preceding that Station ,
<font> viz. <$$font> {COM:symbol_for_station} 7 ,
{COM:symbol_for_station} 8 , WYLD-1725-2,108.204

and proceed to {COM:symbol_for_station} 11 , laying down the several
Occurrences as noted in the Field-book . WYLD-1725-2,108.205

The Rules I observe in these Cases , are , to number with Black-lead all
the Stations I have already laid down in my Draught , and to express
those Numbers successively one after another , in a Piece of a waste
Paper . WYLD-1725-2,108.206

If the Number of the present Station doth not immediately succeed that
of the last , but is greater by an Unit than any of the Numbers in the
<P_109> waste Paper , then I lay down the Angle of the present Station
with the Line I measured immediately before I came to it ,
WYLD-1725-2,109.207

and number it as in the Field-Book . WYLD-1725-2,109.208

But if the Number of the present Station is greater than any in the
waste Paper by more than an Unit , there hath been some Omission in the
waste Paper , which must be rectified . WYLD-1725-2,109.209

If I come to a Station whose Number is already entred in the waste Paper
, then I return to that Station in my Draught , WYLD-1725-2,109.210

and there lay down that Angle with the Line measured , immediately
before I came to this Station the first Time . WYLD-1725-2,109.211

Thus observing these Directions , may the Plot be laid down without any
Burthen at all to the Memory ; WYLD-1725-2,109.212

and if it was surveyed by one Man , it may be plotted by another ,
provided the Person who surveyed it did observe these Rules ;
WYLD-1725-2,109.213

and any Method of keeping a Field-book , that lays a Burthen on the
Memory , is imperfect , and not fit for Practice . WYLD-1725-2,109.214

The remaining Part of the Work is reserved for the Exercise of the
Reader : WYLD-1725-2,109.215

The Plan thereof was here laid down by a Scale of 1$$4 of an Inch :
WYLD-1725-2,109.216

I sometimes lay down the Plot of each Field by a Scale of half an Inch
or larger , if the Plot will lie on one Sheet of Paper ,
WYLD-1725-2,109.217

and cast up the Content of each separately by that Scale ;
WYLD-1725-2,109.218

and for this Purpose , the Sheets with Meridians ready printed thereon ,
are very serviceable , though I afterwards lay down the whole Plan
together by a Scale of a Quarter of an Inch or less , entring the
Content of each Field , as cast up by the large Scale in the Middle
thereof . WYLD-1725-2,109.219

<P_110>

<heading>

Sect. III . WYLD-1725-2,110.222

<font> Of Reducing Plots . <$$font> WYLD-1725-2,110.223

<$$heading>

The Plot of a Manor or Lordship consisting of several Hundred Acres
lying together , being laid down by a Scale of a Quarter of an Inch or
less , may yet be larger than is desired , WYLD-1725-2,110.225

and therefore must be reduced into a lesser Compass .
WYLD-1725-2,110.226

Now for the Performance of this Work there are several Instruments , as
, a long Scale made with a Center-hole at One Third Part thereof ; so
that Two Third Parts may be numbred one Way with equal Parts , from the
Center-hole to the End , and the other Third Part numbred the other Way
with the same Number of equal Parts , though less according to what
Proportion you please ; WYLD-1725-2,110.227

but to pass by this , and several others , I shall only give an Instance
of the Parallelogram , which for Generality , Exactness and Dispatch
surpasseth all others , and is commonly made of Six Wooden Rulers joined
together , and supported by Brass Feet , with Holes in the Rulers for
setting the Instrument to certain Proportions . WYLD-1725-2,110.228

But I have lately seen one of these Instruments made of Brass in a
different Form from the other , and much better , because it may be set
to any given Proportion whatever , by the Help of Sliding Centers , that
are moved along certain Lines calculated for that Purpose , and divided
on the Sides of the Parallelogram ; so that a Plott may be reduced with
the utmost Exactness to any given Ratio , in Respect of the former ,
either in Proportion , as the Length of the Sides of the foul Plott
shall be to the fair one , or else as the Area of the one to the Area of
the other ; WYLD-1725-2,110.229

and another Thing may be said of this Instrument <P_111> that Curves are
as well reduced thereby as Right-Lines ; which by any other Instrument
is exceeding difficult , if not impossible to be done .
WYLD-1725-2,111.230

The Parallellogram being fixed upon a very smooth and even Table , and
the foul Plott , and fair Paper fastened thereon , one over-against the
other , set the Parallellogram to what Proportion you would have your
reduced Plott be of , in Respect of the former ; WYLD-1725-2,111.231

then bring the Point of the Tracer to one of the outmost Angles of the
foul Plott , WYLD-1725-2,111.232

and put in the Point which is to draw , in its Place , letting it rest
on the fair Paper ; WYLD-1725-2,111.233

then move the Tracer with a gentle , equal Motion , over all the Lines
of the foul Plott ; WYLD-1725-2,111.234

so shall the Motion thereof occasion the Drawing-Point to draw upon the
clean Paper or Parchment , the true and exact Figure of the former Plott
, tho' of another Bigness , according to what Proportion you set your
Instrument ; which will better appear by seeing the Instrument once used
, than Words can possibly explain . WYLD-1725-2,111.235

When you have gone round the Lines that enclose one Field , you may take
out the Drawing-Point , and bring the Tracer to any other Point on the
foul Plott ; WYLD-1725-2,111.236

then put the Drawing-Point in its Place again , WYLD-1725-2,111.237

and proceed on with your Work . WYLD-1725-2,111.238

<font> Note <$$font> , This Instrument is useful , not only for this
Purpose , but also for Copying any small Print , <font> &c. <$$font> in
Miniature . WYLD-1725-2,111.239

But for Reducing great Plotts of Land , it should be made of a larger
Size than is commonly used for other Purposes . WYLD-1725-2,111.240

Sect. IV . WYLD-1725-2,112.243

<font> Directions for Beautifying and Adorning of Plotts . <$$font>
WYLD-1725-2,112.244

<$$heading>

Having reduced the Plan of the Lordship , Manor , <font> &c. <$$font>
to the intended Bigness ; 't@ @is necessary to draw imaginary Lines both
vertical and horizontal , denoted by Letters at the Top and Bottom , and
also on the Sides , to be referred to by the Table of References , for
the ready finding of any Field or Parcel of Land therein contained ,
such as you will find in the new Maps of <font> London , &c. <$$font>
WYLD-1725-2,112.246

The <font> North <$$font> Part of the Plott is always supposed to be
placed upwards , and the <font> East <$$font> to be on the Right Hand ,
WYLD-1725-2,112.247

The Representation of Hedges ought to be laid down on the same Side of
the Fences that they are in the Land , and to be broke off where there
are to be Representations of Gates . WYLD-1725-2,112.248

The Out-Borders of the Plott , at least such as border next to the
Demesnes , ought to be fill'd with the adjacent Hedges , and the Tenants
or Owners Names of the Grounds . WYLD-1725-2,112.249

If you describe all Rivers , Highways , Windmills , great 'lone Trees ,
Gates , Stiles , <font> &c. <$$font> that fall within your Plott , it
will add to the Beauty thereof . WYLD-1725-2,112.250

The Ground-Plott of Buildings , ought in all Cases to be expressed by
the same Scale that the rest of the Plott was laid down by , and to be
taken Notice of in the Table of References ; WYLD-1725-2,112.251

but never go about to draw the Representation of an House or Barn in the
Midst of the Plott , so big as will cover an Acre or two of Land .
WYLD-1725-2,112.252

<P_113>

But if you would express a Gentleman's Seat , or Manor-house , 't@ @is
best done in some Corner of the Draught , or in a Plan by itself ,
annext to that of the Estate to which it belongs . WYLD-1725-2,113.254

And the House must be drawn in Perspective , <paren> as you will be
shewed hereafter <$$paren> WYLD-1725-2,113.255

and if the Gardens , Walks and Avenues to the House are expressed , it
must be in the same Manner ; WYLD-1725-2,113.256

and where there are Trees , they must be shadowed on the light Side .
WYLD-1725-2,113.257

If you will take the Pains , you may , in one of the upper Corners of
the Plan , draw the Mansion-House , <font> &c. <$$font> in the other
the Lord's Coat of Arms , with Mantle , Helm , Crest and Supporters , or
in a Compartiment , blazoning the Coat in its true Colours :
WYLD-1725-2,113.258

In one of the Corners at the Bottom , you may describe a Circle , with
the 32 Points of the Mariners Compass , according to the Situation of
the Ground , with a <font> Flower-de-luce <$$font> at the <font> North
<$$font> Part thereof , ever allowing the Variation of the Needle : And
in the other Corner , make a Scale equal to that by which the Plott was
laid down , adorning it with Compasses , Squares , Ovals , <font> &c.
<$$font> WYLD-1725-2,113.259

Having wrote {COM:sic} the Name and Content of each Close about the
Middle thereof , you may , about the Bounds of each Field or Enclosure ,
with a small Pencil and some transparent Colour , neatly go over the
black Lines ; WYLD-1725-2,113.260

so shall you have a transparent Stroke or Margin on either Side of your
black Lines , which being shadowed , will add a great Lustre and Beauty
to the Plott . WYLD-1725-2,113.261

If you would have your Fields all coloured , it will not be amiss to
pounce over the Paper or Parchment with some Stanish-Grain and burnt
Allom , and a double Quantity of Rosin , finely searced and lightly
pumiced , to preserve the Paper from being pierced through with the
Colours ; <P_114> or wet it over with Allom-Water , which will add to
the Lustre of the Colours . WYLD-1725-2,114.262

Then lay on the Colours in Manner following , being first ground , and
bound with Gum-Water very thin and bodiless : WYLD-1725-2,114.263

Arable for Corn , you may wash with pale Straw-Colour , made of yellow
Oker and White-lead ; WYLD-1725-2,114.264

for Meadows , take Pink and Verdigrease in a light green ; Pasture in a
deep green of Pink , Azure and Smalts ; Fenns , a deep green ; as also
Heaths of yellow and Indico ; Trees , a sadder green , of White-lead and
Verdigreese ; WYLD-1725-2,114.265

for Mudd-Walls and Ways , mix White-lead and Rust of Iron ,
WYLD-1725-2,114.266

or with Okers brown of <font> Spain <$$font> for white Stone , take
Umber and White , WYLD-1725-2,114.267

Water or Glass may be shewn with Indico and Azure or Black-lead ;
WYLD-1725-2,114.268

for Seas , a greenish Sky-Colour , of Indico , Azure , Smalts ,
White-lead and Verdigreese . WYLD-1725-2,114.269

Having washed your Pencil very clean , take a small Quantity of the
Colour , WYLD-1725-2,114.270

and on the Inside of the bounding Line draw the Colour along , of an
equal Breadth , as near as you can , broader or narrower as the Field is
in Bigness ; WYLD-1725-2,114.271

and having gone round the Field in this Manner , swill the Pencil in
fair Water , WYLD-1725-2,114.272

and strike along the Inside of the coloured Line , bringing it more down
towards the Middle of the Field ; WYLD-1725-2,114.273

and this will soften your Colour , and make it shew as if it lost itself
by Degrees to the very Colour of the Paper : WYLD-1725-2,114.274

Lastly , with a Pen take some of that Colour which shadoweth the Colour
you laid on the Field , WYLD-1725-2,114.275

and go over the Black-lead Line only ; WYLD-1725-2,114.276

so shall your Field be finished . WYLD-1725-2,114.277

In this Manner , you may make 100 Fields in one Plott , of divers
Colours , observing , as near as you can , not to colour Two Fields
adjoining to one another of the same Colour ; WYLD-1725-2,114.278

and therefore it will be convenient to understand what Colours <P_115>
best set off one another ; and as near as you can , lay the Enclosures
adjoining to one another , of Two such Colours , that one Shadow may
serve both . WYLD-1725-2,115.279

This Colouring and Adorning of Plotts , is rather the Painter's Work
than the Surveyor's : WYLD-1725-2,115.280

Yet if he has Time to spare , and Patience to finish the Work , it may
prove a pretty Diversion : WYLD-1725-2,115.281

But for general Practice , I would recommend the Use of <font>
Indian-ink <$$font> {TEXT:font_change_around_"Indian"} , which ground
very fine upon a smooth Tile , and the Hedges or Bounders of each Field
shadowed therewith , will look very neat , and make the Plott resemble
one done from a Copper-Plate , if rightly managed . WYLD-1725-2,115.282

The Water-Colours before-@ @mention'd , you may have in Shells ready
prepared <paren> being much readier than to trouble yourself with
Grinding , <font> &c. <$$font> <$$paren> as also the <font> Indian
<$$font> - Ink , Pencils , <font> &c. <$$font> at Mr. <font> Keyton

<font> Shewing how to measure any Piece of Land , by the Chain only .
<$$font> WYLD-1725-2,116.287

The Content of any Piece of Land may be found , or a Plott thereof made
, by the Chain only : So that if a Person is not furnished with
Instruments more artificial , he may work with the Chain only in the
following Manner , though it be somewhat laborious and tedious .
WYLD-1725-2,116.288

Sect. I . WYLD-1725-2,116.289

<font> Let {TEXT:Let.} Fig. 23 . be the Representation of a Field ,
whose Content in Acres is desired , without any Plott thereof .
<$$font> WYLD-1725-2,116.290

<$$heading>

First , I walk about it , WYLD-1725-2,116.292

and set up Marks at the several Angles , <font> a <$$font> , <font> b
<$$font> , <font> d <$$font> , <font> e <$$font> , <font> g <$$font> ,
<font> h <$$font> , <font> k <$$font> , <font> l <$$font> , <font> n
<$$font> , viewing <paren> as I go along <$$paren> from which Angle to
which Angle it will be most convenient to run a Diagonal or Base Line ,
as the Line <font> a <$$font> , <font> g <$$font> ; so that a
Perpendicular from the opposite Angles , as <font> b <$$font> and <font>
n <$$font> , may fall upon this Diagonal or Base , in a convenient
Manner at Right Angles : WYLD-1725-2,116.293

and <font> note <$$font> , we commonly chuse the longest Line between
any Two opposite Angles that form the Trapezia or Triangle , to be the
Base Line . WYLD-1725-2,116.294

<P_117>

Having a Sheet of Paper in Readiness , on which to draw an Eye-Draught
of the whole Work , I make some Remark near the Angle , at <font> a
<$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,117.296

and lay the Chain thereto , stretching it in a strait Line towards the
opposite Angle <font> g <$$font> ; WYLD-1725-2,117.297

then I draw a strait Line on the Paper , to represent the Line <font> a
<$$font> , <font> g <$$font> , which I am about to measure ;
WYLD-1725-2,117.298

and proceed with the Chain towards the Angle <font> g <$$font> .
WYLD-1725-2,117.299

When I have measured 4 Chain on the Line <font> a <$$font> , <font> g
<$$font> , I perceive my self almost over-against the Angle <font> b
<$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,117.300

therefore having laid the Chain a Fifth Time , I set down an Arrow at
the End of the Chain next <font> g <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,117.301

and let it lie on the Ground in the Direction of <font> a <$$font> ,
<font> g <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,117.302

and then endeavour to find a Point in the Base <font> a <$$font> ,
<font> g <$$font> ; from which , a Right Line measured in the Angle
<font> b <$$font> , may stand at Right Angles upon the Base <font> a
<$$font> , <font> g <$$font> . WYLD-1725-2,117.303

For this Purpose I provide a small Brass Cross , with four plain Sights
thereon , having a Socket on the Backside , which I put on the Head of a
short Staff , WYLD-1725-2,117.304

and set the Staff in the Ground close to the Chain ; WYLD-1725-2,117.305

then I set two of the Sights in the Direction of <font> a <$$font> ,
<font> g <$$font> , by looking backwards and forwards through those
Sights till I can see the Mark in each Angle <font> a <$$font> and
<font> g <$$font> ; WYLD-1725-2,117.306

so shall the Mark in the Angle <font> b <$$font> , be seen through the
other Two Sights , if the Staff be set in a Perpendicular from <font> b
<$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,117.307

but if not , I move the Staff backwards and forwards by the Side of the
Chain , in the Line <font> a <$$font> , <font> g <$$font> , till through
Two of the Sights I see <font> a <$$font> and <font> g <$$font> , and
through the other Two the Mark at <font> b <$$font> ;
WYLD-1725-2,117.308

then will the Staff be set in the Point <font> c <$$font> ;
WYLD-1725-2,117.309

and this is the exactest Way . WYLD-1725-2,117.310

But if you have not such a Cross , get a Bit of Board made exactly
square , in Form of a square Trencher , WYLD-1725-2,117.311

and from Corner to Corner draw strait Lines thereon ;
WYLD-1725-2,117.312

and stick a Pin fast and upright in the Line near every Corner ,
WYLD-1725-2,117.313

and make an Hole <P_118> in the Middle of the Board , so that you may
turn it on the Head of a Staff ; WYLD-1725-2,118.314

this , for once , may supply the Want of the Cross .
WYLD-1725-2,118.315

Having found the Point <font> c <$$font> , in the Line <font> a <$$font>
, <font> g <$$font> , there set down a Staff , WYLD-1725-2,118.316

and take Notice how many Chains and Links it is distant from <font> a
<$$font> , <font> viz. <$$font> 418 , WYLD-1725-2,118.317

therefore I apply a Scale to the Right Line on my Eye-Draught ,
WYLD-1725-2,118.318

and near 418 make a Mark at <font> c <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,118.319

but do@ @n't regard whether it be exact or no {COM:sic} ,
WYLD-1725-2,118.320

so it be within 20 or 30 Links , because the true Lengths of each Line
are measured on the Ground . WYLD-1725-2,118.321

Then I measure on the Ground , in a strait Line , the nearest Distance
between <font> c <$$font> and <font> b <$$font> 600 Links ,
WYLD-1725-2,118.322

and erect a Perpendicular on the Point <font> c <$$font> on the Paper ,
as near as I can guess , by applying the End of the Scale to the Line
<font> c <$$font> , <font> a <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,118.323

and by the Edge thereof draw the Line <font> c <$$font> , <font> b
<$$font> , setting close thereto 600 Links , the Length of the
Perpendicular ; WYLD-1725-2,118.324

but do@ @n't regard whether the Line <font> c <$$font> , <font> b
<$$font> , on the Paper , be made of its just Length or not {COM:sic} ,
but only that the Form of the Eye-Draught may be something like that of
the Field , a Resemblance thereof being all that is requisite in this
Case . WYLD-1725-2,118.325

Next I return to the Arrow , WYLD-1725-2,118.326

and measure forwards on the Line <font> a <$$font> , <font> g <$$font> ,
till I am near against the Angle <font> a <$$font> , at the Distance of
616 Links from <font> a <$$font> ; WYLD-1725-2,118.327

and then measure the Perpendicular <font> a <$$font> , <font> n <$$font>
, setting the true Length thereof 168 , close to its Representative on
the Eye-Draught . WYLD-1725-2,118.328

Now I look towards the Fences <font> a <$$font> , <font> b <$$font> and
<font> a <$$font> , <font> n <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,118.329

and because they are strait Lines , I draw <font> b <$$font> , <font> a
<$$font> , <font> a <$$font> , <font> n <$$font> , on the Eye-Draught ,
WYLD-1725-2,118.330

so is that Side of the Field finished . WYLD-1725-2,118.331

From <font> a <$$font> , I proceed with the Chain in a strait Line to
<font> g <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,118.332

and find the whole Length from <font> a <$$font> to <P_119> <font> g
<$$font> , 1375 Links ; which I set close to the Right Line on my
Eye-Draught . WYLD-1725-2,119.333

Then I make that Right Line on the Paper nearly the Length of 1375 ,
WYLD-1725-2,119.334

and draw the Right Lines <font> g <$$font> , <font> b <$$font> , and
<font> g <$$font> , <font> n <$$font> , cutting the Ends of the
Perpendiculars <font> c <$$font> , <font> b <$$font> , and <font> a
<$$font> , <font> n <$$font> ; WYLD-1725-2,119.335

so shall the greatest Part of the Field be expressed on the Paper , by
the Trapezia , <font> a <$$font> , <font> b <$$font> , <font> g <$$font>
, <font> n <$$font> . WYLD-1725-2,119.336

From <font> g <$$font> , I measure in a strait Line towards <font> d
<$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,119.337

and when I come to <font> f <$$font> , I measure the Perpendicular
<font> f <$$font> , <font> e <$$font> , 60 Links , WYLD-1725-2,119.338

and then measure out the Line <font> g <$$font> , <font> d <$$font> , to
<font> d <$$font> 800 Links , WYLD-1725-2,119.339

and draw the Lines <font> g {COM:missing_comma} e <$$font> , <font> e
<$$font> , <font> d <$$font> , on the Eye-Draught , to the Extremity of
the Perpendicular <font> f <$$font> , <font> e <$$font> .
WYLD-1725-2,119.340

Now I number the Angles round the Field , if I can see the Marks at each
, WYLD-1725-2,119.341

and compare 'em with those on the Eye-Draught , WYLD-1725-2,119.342

and thereby discover what Part of the Field I have already measured ,
and what remains to be done . WYLD-1725-2,119.343

In the same Manner as I measured the Triangle <font> g <$$font> , <font>
d <$$font> , <font> e <$$font> , I measure the Triangle <font> g
<$$font> , <font> h <$$font> , <font> k <$$font> , and <font> k <$$font>
, <font> l <$$font> , <font> n <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,119.344

and then if there be so many Angles expressed on the Eye-Draught , as
there are Marks at each Angle round the Field , and if the true Length
of each Base and Perpendicular , as measured in the Field , be expressed
on the Representation of the Eye-Draught , you may proceed to cast up
the Work . WYLD-1725-2,119.345

The same Lines in the Field , <font> Fig. <$$font> 23 , are measured on
the Land with the Chain , as we should have done on the Paper , with the
Scale , if the true Plott of the same Field had been first made by the
plain Table or other standing Instrument ; WYLD-1725-2,119.346

and therefore must be cast up in the same Manner ; WYLD-1725-2,119.347

for you have the true Length of each Base and Perpendicular given on the
Eye-Draught ; WYLD-1725-2,119.348

so the Sum of the Two Perpendiculars <font> c <$$font> , <font> b
<$$font> , and <font> N <$$font> , <font> o <$$font> , multiplied by the
Base <font> a <$$font> , <font> g <$$font> ; also the Bases and <P_120>
Perpendiculars of the other three Triangles multiplied together , and
added into one Sum , the half of that gives the Content of the Field ,
<font> Fig. <$$font> 23 , in square Links , which reduce in Acres ,
<font> &c. <$$font> as directed in Chap. I . WYLD-1725-2,120.349

This is the best Way I can prescribe , for finding the Content of a
Field by the Chain only , without making a Plott thereof ,
WYLD-1725-2,120.350

and is only proper for plain , level Ground , and small Enclosures :
WYLD-1725-2,120.351

But even then , if the Fences are very irregular , 't@ @is better to go
round and measure the Angles by the Chain , taking Offsets from the
Station-Lines to the Fences . WYLD-1725-2,120.352

Indeed if the Fences be tolerably regular <paren> but there are many
Fields , whose Sides are not so strait as <font> Fig. <$$font> 23 .
<$$paren> you may make a true Plott thereof well enough , by observing
at how many Chains and Links the Perpendiculars meet the Base of the
Triangles or Trapezias , by erecting Lines on those Points Perpendicular
to the Base , which made of their true Lengths , as measured on the
Ground , the Sides of the Field may be drawn from the Extremities of the
Base , to the End of each Perpendicular . WYLD-1725-2,120.353

Also observe , if any of these Bases be longer than 10 Chains , leave a
Staff at the tenth , and take the Direction of the Line by that Staff ,
because the Station will be at too great a Distance ;
WYLD-1725-2,120.354

and if the Length be 20 , set up another Staff , and so on .

Sect. II . WYLD-1725-2,121.358

<font> How to measure Angles by the Chain . <$$font>
WYLD-1725-2,121.359

<$$heading>

To this End provide Three round Station-Staves , four or five Foot long
a-piece ; WYLD-1725-2,121.361

and also take Care that the Ring in the Middle of the Chain , and also
those at each Tenth Link be at their due Distance from the Chain's End .
WYLD-1725-2,121.362

1. In order to measure the Angle <font> d <$$font> , <font> o <$$font>
, <font> e <$$font> , <font> Fig. <$$font> 24 , set one of your
Station-Staves as upright as you can at <font> o <$$font> ;
WYLD-1725-2,121.363

and putting the Ring at one End of the Chain over it , let one of your
Assistants take the other End in his Hand , and stretch out the Chain
towards <font> d <$$font> , whilst you standing at <font> o <$$font> ,
direct him to move side-ways till the Station-Staff which he has in his
Hand , be brought into one Right Line with <font> o <$$font> , <font> d
<$$font> , as at <font> a <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,121.364

and there let him leave the Staff . WYLD-1725-2,121.365

Then let him , with the End of the Chain in his Hand , move towards
<font> e <$$font> ; WYLD-1725-2,121.366

and as before , direct him to plant the Third Staff upright in the Line
<font> o <$$font> , <font> e <$$font> , at <font> b <$$font> .
WYLD-1725-2,121.367

Measure the Distance <font> a <$$font> , <font> b <$$font> , in Links
and Tenth Parts , if less than one Chain , WYLD-1725-2,121.368

and enter 'em in the Field-Book 88_1$$2 . WYLD-1725-2,121.369

When you plot {TEXT:plott} this Angle , take with a Pair of Compasses
from a large Scale , the Distance of one Chain ; WYLD-1725-2,121.370

and having drawn a Right-Line <font> d <$$font> , <font> o <$$font> ,
set one Foot of the Compasses in <font> a <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,121.371

and with the other describe an Arch <font> a <$$font> , <font> c
<$$font> ; WYLD-1725-2,121.372

then from the same Scale take 88_1$$2 Links ; WYLD-1725-2,121.373

and setting one Foot of the Compasses at <font> a <$$font> , let the
other fall in the Arch <font> a <$$font> , <font> c <$$font> ,
WYLD-1725-2,121.374

and make a Mark at <font> b : <$$font> WYLD-1725-2,121.375

Lastly , through this Mark , from <font> a <$$font> , draw the Line
<font> o <$$font> , <font> e <$$font> , constituting the Angle <font> d
<$$font> , <font> o <$$font> , <font> e <$$font> . WYLD-1725-2,121.376

<P_122>

Observe to plot {TEXT:plott} your Angles by a large Scale , as an Inch ,
or two Inches , and the Length of the Sides by a smaller , as a Quarter
or Half an Inch : WYLD-1725-2,122.378

Also observe , that when the Length of the Chord <font> a <$$font> ,
<font> b <$$font> , is longer than one Chain , then 't@ @is best to lay
out a Sextant , or two Sextants , in the following Manner .
WYLD-1725-2,122.379

2. The Manner of measuring Angles with the Chain , by laying of
Sextants , is deduced from this known Property of the Circle ,
WYLD-1725-2,122.380

<font> The Radius of every Circle is equal to the Chord of One Sixth
Part <$$font> <paren> or a Sextant <$$paren> <font> of its Periphery .
<$$font> WYLD-1725-2,122.381

Let it be required to measure the Angle <font> b <$$font> , <font> a
<$$font> , <font> c <$$font> , <font> Fig. <$$font> 25 :
WYLD-1725-2,122.382

First , set up a Staff at <font> a <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,122.383

and let the Chain strait in the Direction of <font> a <$$font> , <font>
b <$$font> , to <font> i <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,122.384

and at 50 Links set down an Arrow at <font> o <$$font> ;
WYLD-1725-2,122.385

then let your Assistants hold the Ends of the Chain at <font> o <$$font>
, and <font> a <$$font> , whilst you with the Middle in your Hand ,
laying both Halves strait , set down an Arrow at <font> e <$$font> ,
constituting the equilateral Triangle <font> o <$$font> , <font> a
<$$font> , <font> e <$$font> ; WYLD-1725-2,122.386

so have you laid out the Angle <font> o <$$font> , <font> a <$$font> ,
<font> e <$$font> , a Sextant . WYLD-1725-2,122.387

But if you have two Chains , you may <paren> which is better <$$paren>
lay out the Sextants , so that each Side of the equilateral Triangle be
one Chain {COM:missing_period} WYLD-1725-2,122.388

Now the Chain's End still held at <font> a <$$font> , stretch it through
the Point <font> e <$$font> to <font> d <$$fon> , where also set down an
Arrow : WYLD-1725-2,122.389

Lastly , measure the Distance from the Arrow at <font> d <$$font> , to a
Staff set up one Chain's Length from <font> a <$$font> at <font> u
<$$font> ; WYLD-1725-2,122.390

so shall the Distance <font> d <$$font> , <font> u <$$font> , be 76
Links , and Four Tenths of a Link ; WYLD-1725-2,122.391

Therefore enter in the Field-Book 1@ @=s= , 764@ @=p= , implying 1
Sextant and 764 Parts . WYLD-1725-2,122.392

In order to plot {TEXT:plott} this Angle , <font> b <$$font> , <font> a
<$$font> , <font> c <$$font> , thus measured , chuse some Line divided
into 1000 Parts , WYLD-1725-2,122.393

and making this Line Radius , set one Foot of the Compasses in <font> a
<$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,122.394

and with the other describe the Arch , <font> i <$$font> , <font> z
<$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,122.395

and the Companies continuing at <P_123> the same Extent , set one Foot
in <font> i <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,123.396

and with the other , cross the Arch at <font> d <$$font> ,
WYLD-1725-2,123.397

and there make a Mark . WYLD-1725-2,123.398

Then take 764 Parts from the same Line , divided into 1000 Parts , which
you made Radius ; WYLD-1725-2,123.399

and set one Foot of the Compasses in the Mark at <font> d <$$font> ,
WYLD-1725-2,123.400

and let the other cross the Arch at <font> u <$$font> ,
WYLD-1725-2,123.401

and there make a Mark : WYLD-1725-2,123.402

Lastly , from <font> a <$$font> , draw a Line through the Mark at <font>
u <$$font> , and you will construct the Angle required .
WYLD-1725-2,123.403

If you have not a Line <paren> which is best <$$paren> actually divided
into 1000 Parts , use the largest Diagonal Scale you have ;
WYLD-1725-2,123.404

so you may take off 76 Parts exactly ; WYLD-1725-2,123.405

and the four Tenths you must guess at by moving the Compasses near half
way in the Diagonal towards 77 ; WYLD-1725-2,123.406

also observe , the 10th of a Link is measured on the Land by the
Offset-Staff , having a Link or two thereon , divided into Ten Parts .
WYLD-1725-2,123.407

3. If the Angle be more than Two Sextants , as in <font> Fig. <$$font>
26 ; then having , as before , laid off the Sextant <font> e <$$font> ,
<font> o <$$font> , <font> a <$$font> , let your Assistants hold the
Ends of the Chain at <font> a <$$font> and <font> e <$$font> , while you
with the Middle in your Hand , set down an Arrow at <font> x <$$font> ,
constitutinng another Sextant <font> e <$$font> , <font> a <$$font> ,
<font> x <$$font> . WYLD-1725-2,123.408

Then the Chain being held at <font> a <$$font> , lay it thro' <font> x
<$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,123.409

and at the other End <font> d <$$font> , set down an Arrow :
WYLD-1725-2,123.410

Lastly , measure <font> d <$$font> , <font> u <$$font> , which suppose
to be 42 Links and 5 Tenths ; WYLD-1725-2,123.411

therefore enter in the Field-Book 2 =s= , 425 =p= , signifying 2
Sextants and 425 Parts . WYLD-1725-2,123.412

And if you would protract the Angle of <font> Fig. <$$font> 26 , then
with the Length of the Line divided into 1000 Parts , describe the Arch
<font> i <$$font> , <font> y <$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,123.413

and thereon lay <font> i <$$font> , <font> u <$$font> , and <font> u
<$$font> , <font> d <$$font> , each equal to the Radius or divided Line
; WYLD-1725-2,123.414

and afterwards lay 425 equal Parts from <font> d <$$font> , to <font> u
<$$font> , WYLD-1725-2,123.415

and draw <font> a <$$font> , <font> u <$$font> ; which gives the Angle ,
as required . WYLD-1725-2,123.416
