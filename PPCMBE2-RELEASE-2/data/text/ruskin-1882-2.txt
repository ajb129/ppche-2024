Well , the world has not come to an end yet - quite -
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.4

but if there were to be no more summer than we have had this year , it
would be nearly the same thing . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.5

Up in good time , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.6

reading life of Emperor Gratian at coffee , and seeing my way into much
, which I must now try also to make my way into , with my new pen , and
old heart . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.7

Joanie and all friends fairly well , D. G. , and I also ,

Bad cold on me , since Monday ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.12

very sleepless last night , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.13

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} a quite successful day , though with bad cold ;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.18

did lovely work on Crystals . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.19

To-day , a quite fearful storm of our worst sort , disturbing me from
work , with my head full of material , but yet weak from nightmare all
night . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.20

Sunday . <$$font> RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.24

The mornings <font> always <$$font> as black as Newcastle and the wind
malignant all day long . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.25

My mind driven away from nature wholly into books <paren> except for
geology <$$paren> with more harm to it than I can at all measure .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.26

The difference between a sweet sunrise over the Norwood hills , as I
used to see it in youth , and this drifting blast of furnace smoke ,
tearing the leafage to and fro , and taking every hue of life out of
grass , water , and hills ! RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.27

I write this in good health after a good night , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.28

RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.37

and I sleep well , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.44

and enjoy minerals ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.45

but all the life taken out of nature by the diabolic weather .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.46

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} a red , lurid , languid hundredth part of a sunset ,
all the sun we had in the day . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.47

<font> January 13th . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.48

Fog all day unbroken , and scum on lake . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.51

Fog like Manchester all yesterday ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.58

never got out . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.59

To-day the same , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.60

and I terribly languid . But better so than in that dangerous
excitement which came on me in October , I hope for the last time ,
since I shall never encourage it again . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.61

The fifth day of entirely unbroken fog , filthy as Erebus .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.65

Up on the moor , yesterday {TEXT:y} , above the farm , it felt stifling
and cold at the same time . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.66

Candles and fire the only comforts . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.67

The flowers coming out - polyanthus , primrose and at the harbour
snowdrop - in miserable , languid , autumnal wretchedness .

Wednesday . <$$font> RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.70

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} a little better ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.71

to-day , calm and seemingly meaning to clear , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.72

but the morning sky beginning to be fouled , as I write , by the
plague-cloud ! RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.73

<P_3,1014>

Recumbent wreaths on the Old man , beginning to be touched with warm
light , very beautiful , and reflections in misty lake .

Thursday . <$$font> RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.77

I do@ @n't know when - or if I ever - have felt so utterly listless and
powerless as all yesterday afternoon {TEXT:y_aftn} , in rowing through
mist across lake , and walking sadly by the stream under the rocks which
I saw to be lovely , without a ray of pleasure .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.78

The perpetual absence of sunshine has a quite deadly effect on me ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.79

but I never felt so empty of resolution or care -
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.80

the last word I mean in the mixed sense of affection and attention .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.81

Too much luxury , in little things , sorrow in great , all through life

Recovered heart yesterday {TEXT:y} , though the clouds were black as the
inferno on my return walk from the Thwaite ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.85

and I@ @'ve got the next Chapter of <font> Amiens , <$$font> two <font>
Proserpinas <$$font> and one <font> Deucalion <$$font> all well forward
by this 20th of the first month , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.86

and am myself well hitherto , D. G. RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.87

Calais . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.91

Left Herne Hill station at 10.10 : after walking down there first to
settle Mr. R. Weldene's business . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.92

By Chatham and Dover line through Kent , looking entirely lovely with
perpetual corn and copse . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.93

Crossed in breezy light scud of shower and sunshine ;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.94

but the day was wretched in its beginning and ending , with utterly cold
wind and black sky . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.95

I never saw Calais so dismal ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.96

but , also , its life has been utterly sucked out of it by the railway ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.97

and every shop seems failing , every house becoming ruinous .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.98

The war also has first torn down half the suburbs to build barracks ,
and then left the barracks tenantless ! having taxed the town half of
what it was worth to build them . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.99

We got on board steamer soon after 12 , and into mouth of Calais harbour
at 2.10 , just four hours from Herne Hill . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.100

Collingwood and I walked to Hôtel Dessein RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.101

and afterwards explored town and church , finding little enough ,
chiefly because of dark cold day . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.102

Dined at 1$$2 past seven . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.103

The dinner , by the old chef of old Dessein , really was worth stopping
the day for . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.104

Sketched tracery of Hôtel de Ville - <font> once <$$font> more , as
opposite , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.105

and have only this moment found the law of it , Fig. 2 , describing the
large circles first , and the smaller through their intersection .

Laon . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.109

Yesterday {TEXT:Yesty} , very sad in the morning at Calais , feeling
able for nothing , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.110

and the place too miserable <P_3,1015> to be seen without bitterest pity
. RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.111

To-day , all beautiful round me , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.112

and I feeling as able for my work as ever ! except for sight focus .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.113

The boat train , which should have started from the pier at 2.15 , did
not finally leave the main station till 3.25 , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.114

and we were an hour late everywhere RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.115

and only got here in the dark . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.116

Out at 1$$2 past seven RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.117

and walked till 1$$2 past 10 ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.118

breakfast at 11 . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.119

Got to work on cathedral front at 1.15 RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.120

and worked well for two hours . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.121

Laon . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.124

The entire day was lovely , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.125

and after drawing as long as I could and drinking a glass of Côte Rôtie
, I walked again round the southern valley hollow , to the west end of
the ridge , where hay fields and pear orchards descend to the most
beautiful and richly wooded part of the surrounding plain .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.126

Dined at 1$$2 past seven RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.127

and to bed early . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.128

Starlight evening , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.129

but the morning grim with mist and thunder , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.130

and to-day has been dull , ending in rain now .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.131

At cathedral service among mixed society - RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.132

music and , I thought , marriage couples , two ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.133

but Collingwood {TEXT:Coll} says only the last couples married of the

Fête de l'Assomption . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.138

Yesterday here from Laon , after finishing sketch fairly well .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.139

Here , nothing but disgusts and disappointments , even to 13th century
{TEXT:centy} windows of cathedral , which are entirely grotesque and
frightful in design , though glorious in colour .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.140

And the shafts and vaultings are the worst I ever saw of the time ; the
arches of nave meagre and springless ; the apse only three_sided instead
of five ; and its double buttresses instead of single arch a mass of
weakness and confusion . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.141

The towers more and more are like confectioners' Gothic to me ;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.142

nor have I ever seen so large a building look so small at the ends of
streets . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.143

Reims . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.146

I can@ @not find ugly words enough to describe the building now set on
the north side of the west end of cathedral {TEXT:cath} , a narrow
street between . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.147

It is a sort of pale_faced Newgate or penitentiary with square windows
iron-grilled in a vile thin way in second storey , and as fig. 5 on the
ground one . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.148

The barren , bleak , Roman-cemented stupidity of soul and sense that it
speaks for , set against the old work , kill the old also ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.149

and show all its contrasted follies . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.150

What over-richness and vain labour are in it shown more violently by the
blankness and brutal inertia of the neighbour building .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.151

I ca@ @n't do the iron gratings ugly enough . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.152

It <font> is <$$font> the prison ! RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.153

<P_3,1016>

Prison side by side with Cathedral : RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.155

so our Penitentiary opposite Lambeth . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.156

The shops full of blasphemy , supplying the prison with its daily
congregation . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.157

The Preachers ! lifting up their voice in the synagogues and at the
corners of the streets . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.158

The church of Notredame at Châlons is one of the most perfect examples
of pure early vaulting I have ever seen . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.162

It has a 12th century {TEXT:cent} Door of fine quality , towers with new
, but good , spires . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.163

The Cathedral is nothing : RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.164

at least I have already forgotten it in the extreme interest of St.
Urbain here . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.165

Note also the church of the Madeleine for a quite defaced Norman door of
grandest school , approaching Italian , but with the English dog tooth
on its inner order moulding ; and the basic colonnade of the north porch
of the Cathedral here , fearfully defaced but exquisite in earliest and
delicatest naturalism of geranium and vine . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.166

Here yesterday at two , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.170

and had lovely climb of chalk hills , among sweet marjoram and the vines
. RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.171

No use recording the difficulties of getting across railway , nor any of
the melancholy thoughts in the corridors of the Hôtel de l'Écu .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.172

The balcony of the old large room is seen through my window on the left
, now open in a warm , heavily grey morning . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.173

The Seine divinely beautiful here . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.174

I have never enough thought out that Turner's work was the ' Rivers ' of
France , not the ' towns ' of it . How he was the first painting living
creature who saw the beauty of a ' coteau ' . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.175

The glorious lines of the ascending vineyards to be sketched this
morning , if possible , and the statues of porch deciphered .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.176

They are the finest I hitherto know , north of Alps .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.177

Only the sketch of chalk caves was done and nothing deciphered .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.178

The day , thundrous and oppressive , ended in swift sheet lightning as
we ran into Avallon , with the swiftest chatterer of a woman that
<P_3,1017> I@ @'ve often heard sitting with her back to me , talking to
the gentlemen of her party . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.179

I slept well after a cup of bad tea with sour milk ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.180

and got out directly after coffee this morning to see Avallon .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.181

But I am ceasing to take comfort in what I can do , the declining power
in step - heart - memory , all too evident . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.182

I got no entry made this morning , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.186

but am now sitting at the open window in a sweet French evening .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.187

The most marvellous light of sunset has just faded off the opposite
houses , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.188

and I had a precious walk down the valley of the Cousin , which is
altogether lovely and like Dovedale and the Meuse , and the glens of
Fribourg , in all that each has of best ; and like Chamouni in granite
cleavage ; and like - itself in sweet French looks and ways .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.189

And I am wonderfully sad and listless after it all !
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.190

and I am here in the midst of every element of good work , if I can but
keep good myself . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.196

I woke at 3 , after a long dream of vast building going on , on which we
could not get the scaffoldings level . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.197

Much of confused , more or less grand , always vexing , immemorable
existence in the night hours . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.198

What does it mean , for any of us ? RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.199

Woke RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.200

and thought vainly over <font> Sesame and Lilies . <$$font>

Perhaps now an effort may bring my thoughts to form : though I am more

Laid in the capital in church . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.208

Then Collie discovered original egg and arrow on stairs ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.209

and I traced on the ornament to my Laon moulding from it - a wonderful
day's work ! RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.210

Afterwards , walked in the miraculous fairy valley
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.211

and saw granite cleavages . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.212

This morning , I have great pleasure in reading <font> Deucalion

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} to Vézelay . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.220

More disappointed than ever with anything ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.221

but the interior is still typical Romanesque in the nave , and extremely
pure and melodious early English , or French , in apse .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.222

Note generally that the early churches have only three lights round apse
; and that no interior can be perfect with less than five .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.223

I do not know if there are good examples of seven .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.224

The mimicked ' last judgment ' over central door - M. Viollet le Duc@
@'s {TEXT:V_le_D's} - is very carefully vile , and the whole west front
the ugliest and most chaotically barren I ever saw in an old building .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.225

Found junction of granite and Jura coming back ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.226

and was happy . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.227

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} entirely bleak , dark and wet till sunset , when an
hour's respite came , with stormy and ominous lights and flying low
cirri . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.231

Walked , having nothing better to do , to Sauvigny-le-Blanc
{COM:blank_in_text,_but_see_fn._2} RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.232

and found after long search in rain , the little oratory of St. John
des Bons Hommes . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.233

I ought to vignette it for a title to my books !
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.234

The two last nights were terribly disturbed by miserable piano and
singing in café . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.235

I slept well , last night , D. G. RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.236

, but had a long sad dream of all L.'s furniture and pictures to be sold
at Sotheby's <paren> Christie's <$$paren> and I the only creature to buy
the family pictures , with some extraordinarily beautiful native silvers
and other mineral , large and very clearly seen in the dream .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.237

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} an entirely lovely walk , up the river and home by
dingle , like the ascent to Mr. Marshall's tarns ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.242

and felt extremely well ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.243

but took chocolate after dinner , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.244

and now after a long heavy sleep am headachy , with relaxation in throat
, perhaps beginning of cold , perhaps stomachic only .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.245

I must note the feeling carefully , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.246

it is of a kind that always makes me nervous . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.247

I felt a little tired after the walk , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.248

and the horrible wind met me , after the shelter of the ravine , in
returning , for the last 1$$4 of an hour . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.249

My white queen of salvias in profusion all up the sides of the glen .

Quite frightful weather all yesterday {TEXT:y} , ending in rain and wind
. RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.254

Walked by short cut down to <P_3,1019> valley RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.255

and rested , very languid and ill , in lovely field , watching - Baxter
with breathless interest - a group of ladies fishing .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.256

Walked back by myself through wood walk , finding lovely flowers ;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.257

but joyless all day RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.258

and grievous long two hours' waking - 12 to 2 - at night , followed by
dismal dreams and slight relaxation of throat .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.259

All stomach , I believe . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.260

To-day brighter RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.261

I have been grumbling over a ' lost ' week here :
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.266

but when has a week been better spent , as to gaining of knowledge ?
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.267

I have had three <font> quite <$$font> delightful walks ; the first
morning of discovery , the one in the fairy valley first discovered ,
and the one up the valley and round - without counting that down the
river ! RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.268

And the drive to Vézelay was delightful . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.269

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} the wind worse than ever , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.270

but I was better driving to Mont-Réal and seeing the most marvellous
village {COM:sic} ever was , than if I had been all day at home in
London . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.271

And I forget the good of all these things , as if I were a butterfly in
a shower , when things go cross . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.272

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} especially well in the afternoon , after fighting
with rain and sun at cathedral door , and sketching among blackberries
in lower glen ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.277

peculiarly well in evening and going to bed . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.278

But woke at 3 with stomach disturbance , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.279

and sleeping again towards 5 , dreamed of my special Valley of Chamouni
with the steeper sides , and of being with my mother at Geneva in a new
garden of St. George's company , where the gardener had done his best ,
and there was a great deal of company , and I was making much of my
mother and myself . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.280

Too much reality in these dreams ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.281

they do@ @n't mean real sleep , but only dozing .

Rain again , and all black above . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.287

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} fighting with rain , small and large , in the porch .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.288

Could get hardly anything done . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.289

Walked afterwards down valley , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.290

caught in thunderstorm ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.291

then saw the perfect scene at the bend of river , climbing the bank of
ling . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.292

Very hot walking home RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.293

but enjoyed dinner , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.294

and am very well this morning , but entirely appalled and crushed by the
evil days : beyond all former wretched experience .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.295

It never relaxes from the black wind , but for gushes of rain and
flushes of thunder heat . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.296

<P_3,1020>

Found my favourite Vestal , No. 11 , p. 16 , in luxuriance just beyond
the great slope of ling . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.298

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} after the most frightful fight I ever had with wind
and sun - for I never before would draw in such weather , nor did such
ever before exist to draw in ! - we had a really happy rest and walk in
the lower valley , exploring it to the bridge , and ascertaining it to
be one of the sweetest ever made by heaven . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.303

The Cyclopean walls , of blocks seven and eight feet long , and three
feet thick , the largest , all averaging two and a half cube , at a
guess , laid with their smooth cleavages to the outside , fitted like
mosaic ; the chinks filled with smaller stones , altogether peculiar to
this district of <font> cleaving , <$$font> and little twisting ,
granite . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.304

<font> Is <$$font> it sixteen years since ? The walk among the hills
and the nightingales ! RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.308

And have I not been here all those years ? RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.309

I ca@ @n't think my last sketch of Notredame so far away :
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.310

yet when can it have been ? RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.311

And I@ @'ve lost Notredame now for ever ! RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.312

Never was such a total destruction since San Michele of Lucca .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.313

This tour to be the Memorial of both . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.314

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} a tormented broken day , stopping at Semur , where
the horribly vulgar Gothic of church - Swiss brutality of late 13th
century - disgusted me for the day . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.315

I had bad , fidgetty , feverish tiredness on me as we came down on the
valley of nightingales , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.316

and now am discomfited after restless , silent night , since two - full
of sorrowful thought . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.317

It is clearing now after rain all night , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.318

and I hope for Citeaux . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.319

Note at Semur that the jambs of the western porches are wrought with
rich though flat panelling of the time of north door of Rouen , very
good , and the arch traceries at the sides have been full of grand
sculpture of the same kind , all deliberately chiselled away , not
merely broken , at Revolution : yet the chiselling so careless and
incomplete as to leave the subjects still traceable in outline , often
beautiful . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.320

Better than Protestant History of Catholicism any how .

Champagnole . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.325

I never thought to date from this dear place more ;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.326

and I am here in - for my age - very perfect health , so far as I feel
or know ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.327

and was very thankful on my mother's birthday to kneel down once more on
the rocks of Jura . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.328

We got to their foot - where , sixteen years ago , we had to leave poor
Lady Trevelyan - about five o'clock in a perfect afternoon ;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.329

and saw the glorious views on ascent towards Montarlier as never before
. RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.330

I had only made the ascent in morning light . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.331

The evening sunshine on the vines and crags and then on the vast plain
and villages , unspeakable . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.332

Then at the station , a little walk on the mountain ground among the
Euphrasy ; a cup of coffee with Swiss milk ; and a star lesson from
Collie as Arcturus shone out to the north and Vega at the zenith .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.333

But yesterday {TEXT:y} was chiefly notable for the morning visit to St.
Bernard's birthplace . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.334

All remnant {COM:sic} of château now destroyed ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.335

but the little level garden on the exact summit of the hill must have
been always grass or garden , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.336

and the childhood have had always that panorama under its eyes .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.337

Now all that is near is vineyard , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.338

but , before Cîtaux {COM:sic} and Clairvaux , what was it ?
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.339

The panorama entirely unbroken : RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.340

Mont Blanc to the hills of Eastern Burgundy and the plain , limitless
north and south . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.341

The little hill a limestone outlier , about a_hundred_and_fifty feet
above plain . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.342

St. Cergues . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.346

Here , with the sweet pines and beech and lawns , seen from my window ;
the Alps , when the clouds lift , within two minutes' walk , under
command from Moleson to the Chartreuse . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.347

It seemed to me , during a somewhat restless and sad interval of the
night , as if my life , with its work and failing , were all looped and
gathered in between St. Cergues farewell to Mont Blanc in 1845 and St.
Cergues return in 1882 . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.348

Thirty-seven years . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.349

Thirty-seven : RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.351

afternoon in which I got the ajuga , no. 24 , and saw the Lake of
Geneva , once more ! RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.357

Little Nyon at its foot seems unspoiled ; at its edge , I mean ; still ,
as seen from here , a pretty , sober group of tower and roof .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.358

<P_3,1022>

Got useful letter written to Swan , and the Ajuga drawn ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.360

and have had sound sleep ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.361

yet my eyes are dim this morning , the blue lines not as clear as they
should be . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.362

Relieved of anxiety about Joan , yesterday morning , by telegram as I
was reading 104th Psalm to Collie . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.363

A starlight night , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.368

and troublous thoughts kept me awake from twelve to about two .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.369

Then I was waked by sunshine on opposite glade ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.370

and got out by 1$$4 to six , only to see all the Alps covered and the
lake wholly concealed by what seemed a mass of London smoke , silvered
at the top only . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.371

Plague wind below the turn of the valley , sharp from the south , and
cold . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.372

Walked back with many wondering thoughts , feeling also my head heavy ,
and definitely the sense of what is always indefinitely
{COM:initial_"in"} on me at other times - a feebleness of sight ,
without dimness of it ; quite inexplicable . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.373

The motes even less than usual , yet the sight oppressed .

In old corner room of the Hôtel des Bergues . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.379

The sky and air exactly like Sheffield , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.380

but wind quiet for the last hour after blowing like wildcats and witches
all day yesterday {TEXT:y} . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.381

Bitter cold , with hot sun as we climbed the Dôle , only to see from it
the entire chain of Alps smothered entirely down and snuffed out by one
mass of foul , brown gray , natural - or supernatural - smoke of the
Devil's best patent make , reaching nearly across the lake so that we
could not see Geneva , much less the Salève . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.382

But the sky above us all clear , and fairly healthy in colour , and the
view over lower Jura towards France very grand in misty sun ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.383

but wind so bitter that I could not examine anything right or left of
Jura , where I most wanted . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.384

The south_western chain to the fort l'Écluse entirely puzzled and upset
my notions of it , I never having allowed for the vast longitudinal
valley , which the road to the Col de la Faucille is terraced above -
the valley of the Valserine . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.385

We came down from the Dôle a little below , eastward of the little col
which separates this valley from that of Les Rousses .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.386

We walked up the carriage road to it , I asking an old woman staggering
slowly up under a sack whether the Café of ' Tabajo ' , our rendezvous ,
was near . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.387

The Café was just on the little col , at the south end of it , see fig.

Rose light over Jura very wonderful ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1023.396

Better than mere black haze or even thundrous sunshine .

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} from Geneva here in mere phantasmagoria of
smoke-cloud ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1023.409

and a sleepless night leaves me to-day despondent and fit for nothing .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1023.410

But , at last , 9 o'clock , the dingy clouds seem breaking from the
Aiguilles du Gouté and de Bionnassay , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1023.411

quite , but dome under mist ; the Mont Blanc {TEXT:B} de St. Gervais
entirely , and the aiguilles Plan and Midi all dark against light pure
cirri above sunrise . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1024.423

In a quarter of an hour , the plague cloud formed , from the west ,
coming from Mont Joli , brown , and in heavy flakes , covering all as
low as the base of the aiguille {TEXT:aig} de Bionassay .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1024.424

By 1$$2 past six one could only see a black point or two of aiguilles ;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1024.425

the valley was half filled with cloud , thin and streaky but dirty , and
all in a state of flux , flight , change and diseased motion and make .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1024.426

Now , seven , all the sky is covered , the sun which shone for about ten
minutes as it rose , totally extinguished over the whole valley from St.
Gervais to Cluse ! RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1024.427

glen which , to distinguish from the great one that has the château in

There is a lovely boulder in the bed of a rivulet , to be found by the
path leading through a group of cottages to the left , at a little

<paren> I saw a tablet used for front of a water trough among the

Note that hitherto , since the thunder at Mornex , the lower air has

only five or six miles away ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1025.445

Fresh snow on the Varens , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1025.457

and was not the least tired ! RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1O26.513

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} received in the grey morning the news of the death of
John Bunney , on that Saturday the 23 on which I saw the bright Alps
from his Italy . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1029.619

A heavy warning to me , were warning needed ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1029.620

but I fear death too constantly , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1029.621

and feel it too fatally , as it is . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1029.622

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} up the marble hills again , where eight years ago I
lay down so happy under the rocks beyond the monastery , to read

RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1030.630

drew in peace at duomo front in quiet air , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1030.631

and climbed to the ridge of marble mountains in afternoon , past the
convent with its great ilex and the perfect cottage with its well under
the chestnuts , and so up to the terraced fields .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1030.632

Saw the glittering sea and Gorgona RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1030.633

and sat {TEXT:sate} long watching the soft sunlighted terraces of grass
, and tenderly classic hills , plumed and downy with wood , the burning
russet of fallen chestnuts for foreground ; thinking how lovely the

and drove to foot of hills across Serchio , where we rested among olive
woods , with low cypress avenues mingled . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1030.641

Grass terraces under the olive trees quite rich in grass , and the

After that exulting entry yesterday {TEXT:y} , everything went wrong .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.830

Rain came on just as I had got to work RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.831

and poured all day , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.832

and quite unexpected company in the evening put me out .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.833

But I@ @'ve slept fairly well , waked near 5 by crashing rain ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.834

and all is now cloudy and dismal , plague blackness driving from the
west . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.835

Tuesday . <$$font> RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.837

Lucca . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.838

Up in good heart , after a little stomach attack which kept me waking ,
but left me clear-headed enough to get plans into shape , of which the
principal is the settlement opposite of days for address .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.839

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} worked hard against wind and rain ,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.840

but had lovely walk under and opposite the monastery , among nice
chestnut gatherers in Greek draperies , and arbutus bushes like fruits
of Paradise , myrtle berries for blaeberries , and acorned ilex .

Lucca . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.844

Up well , after a rather restless night , however , with stomach ;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.845

but the morning dismal , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.846

and for the first time , seven o'clock too early for light .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.847

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} worked very hard on pillar RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.848

and had nice little chat with two <font> contadine <$$font> , explaining
my drawing and the cathedral front to them . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.849

One , presently <paren> middle_aged unfortunately , or more than middle
<$$paren> had her arm round my neck in her eagerness to know if I was
going to draw the entire front . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.850

And the day before yesterday a pretty <font> young <$$font> housewife
gave me a graceful good day in passing up the steps before me .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.851

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} in afternoon , up the convent glen with Mr. and Mrs.

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} hard work on duomo RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.856

but got on , only not so delicately by half as I expected , and never
able to finish . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.857

<P_3,1036>

In afternoon , up to the chief dingle with quarry , past the campanile ,
with Mr. and Mrs. Robson : RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.859

and all enjoyed it . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.860

Newman left by 6.20 train for Florence RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.861

and we were very sorry to lose him . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.862

Friday come {COM:sic} - RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.869

and it was so far away on Tuesday ! RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.870

But yesterday {TEXT:y} was a good day . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.871

I did two revises , or 1_3$$4 , before breakfast ;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.872

saw picture in Pinacothek ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.873

finished , virtually , duomo drawing rightly , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.874

and went for afternoon {TEXT:aftn} walk up the Monte Pisano again to the
very top , round by the ridge during glorious sunset ;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.875

saw Pisa and Lucca on right hand and left ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.876

came down full pace as in old times ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.877

ended with celestial walk in moonlight on the winding marble road .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.878

Three hours' hard walking , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.879

and not an atom tired . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.880

Slept well , or fairly well , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.881

and am very thankfully up , fresh , to morning work .

Nearly pitch_dark at eight o'clock , after coffee ;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.888

frantic black clouds and roaring Arno after thunder all night ,
beginning at 1$$2 past 5 between Prato and here , and glaring ,
flickering and crashing , till seven this morning , waking me at one
with a peal like a great gun going off at one's ear .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.889

I , of course , languid enough RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.890

and do@ @n't know what to do with myself . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.891

Very weary to-day and spiritless after much over_excitement yesterday ,
with the loving and generous Alexanders and the gush and gratitude of
Alessandro . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.897

I ought to have new life in me - which <paren> under the depression
<$$paren> I have - in knowing there are such good people in the world ;
nor exceptionally , but in multitudes , if one looks for them , as
Couttet used to say of the chamois , ' où il {COM:sic} sont . '

Still out of spirit , though I had a lovely , and loveliest , drive
yesterday {TEXT:y} in afternoon to Fésole , and round to Settignano ,
where festa in twilight with band playing and remains of sunset in
clouds . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.902

But the turning one's back on it all <P_3,1037> till spring is sad -
though Mr. Newman tells me the anemones are just on the spring , <font>
now <$$font> ! And that there@ @'s <font> no <$$font> winter in
Florence . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.903

And all has gone well with me , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.904

and I ought to be more than angry with myself for not being hard at work
this morning in the best of spirits . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.905

A quite heavenly morning on Monte Pisano : RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.909

somehow it reminds me of old Scotland and hill of Moncrieff .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.910

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} , after coming from Florence , the grandest sunset on
the quaint western side of city , and quietest , intense Robson twilight
on ramparts - hills seen from them , I mean - that I have had yet .

The sun full on the hills , rosy , and not like a November morning .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.915

Three months left to me of my sixty_fourth year !
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.916

I have done much in this last one , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.917

and must try to keep myself as carefully industrious .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.918

I date ' Lucca ' for the last time this year . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.919

Yesterday {TEXT:Y} the grandest sunset , not only of Italy this time ,
but one of the twenty or thirty I have seen in my life . Blood_crimson
and gold , with green bars between : the steady glow of it filling all
the heaven and all the earth for half an hour .

RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.924

This the first morning in which I can scarcely see to do so .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.925

Wet , after the loveliest day we@ @'ve had in Italy , yesterday {TEXT:y}
, from dawn to sunset ; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.926

sun in entering Pisa , on the Carraras , never before seen half so well
or so beautifully . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.927

Left Collie sketching , RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.928

and I walked round by Baptistery , crowded through all its field by
festive All Saints . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.929

But the crowd spoiled both it and the duomo . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.930

Feeling of cold this morning , also for the first time .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.931

I hope stomach only , after fatiguing though delightful dinner with Mr.

Bad cold upon me at last , and for no cause that I can trace whatever .
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.936

But , strangely , I had very pleasant dreams , one quite lovely of fresh
snow on Monte Altissimo , and others , pleasant , of finding new veins
of rock and new specimens of chalcedony . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1037.937

Ah , if I could recollect the Aiguille Bionassay of the <P_3,1038> 13th
September {TEXT:Sept} of which I have said no word yet but the allusion
in p. 40 . RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1038.938
