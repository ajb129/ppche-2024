The British Housewife : or , The <font> Cook , Housekeeper's , and
Gardiner's <$$font> Companion . BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.5

SECT. I . BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.6

<font> of the Nature of fresh Provisions , Pickles , and Preserves .
<$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.7

CHAP. I . BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.8

<font> Of fresh Provisions in general . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.9

<$$heading>

We are to conduct the Cook and House-Keeper throughout the Year ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.11

and we begin with the first Month . BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.12

<font> January <$$font> is a dead Season : BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.13

In the Course of this Month there is less Variety than in any other ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.14

the Cook therefore is with her utmost Care to make the best of what
Nature affords : BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.15

and we shall instruct her to do that to the greatest Advantage .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.16

We shall here by way of Introduction to the rest , lay before her a
general List or Catalogue of fresh Provisions , that she may in one View
see her Store ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.17

and we shall , in their proper Places , enter more particularly on their
Qualities and Choice . BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.18

This is to be considered as a Chapter of Rembrance rather than
Instruction . BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.19

It contains what every one knows , but none is ever to forget .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.20

<P_4>

These Provisions are supply'd from four principal Sources , the <font>
Field , <$$font> the <font> Yard , <$$font> the <font> Pond , <$$font>
and the <font> Garden . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.22

From the Field we have the substantial Part , <font> Meat <$$font> of
all Kinds ; from the Yard <font> Poultry <$$font> ; from the Pond <font>
Fish <$$font> ; and from the Garden <font> Greens , Roots <$$font> and
<font> Fruits . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.23

We shall here give a general Catalogue of them together , and hereafter
, in the Bill of Fare for this and the succeeding Months , shew which of
them are most , and which least in Season ; which in their Prime , and
which entirely out . BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.24

We have Meat principally from three Sources , the Ox , the Sheep , and
the Hog ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.25

and from each of these there are several Kinds of Provision , according
to their Age and Management . BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.26

From the <font> Ox <$$font> Kind we have <font> Beef <$$font> and <font>
Veal <$$font> ; from <font> Sheep , Mutton <$$font> and <font> Lamb
<$$font> ; and from the <font> Hog , Bacon , Pork <$$font> , and <font>
Pig . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.27

To these we are to add <font> Venison , <$$font> the Flesh of the <font>
Deer ; <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.28

and if we subjoin the Flesh of the <font> Kid , Hares <$$font> and
<font> Rabbets , <$$font> we have in our View all that is furnished by
the four-footed Kind . BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.29

The <font> Poultry <$$font> of our Yard are a small Part of the Store we
receive from the winged Kind ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.30

for those which live wild are more numerous and more valuable .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.31

Among the tame we are to reckon the common <font> Fowl , <$$font> the
<font> Turkey , <$$font> the <font> Goose , <$$font> and <font> Ducks ;
<$$font> to which we may occasionally add the <font> Swan <$$font> and
<font> Peacock . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.32

To the Cock and Hen kind we may also add the <font> Pheasant <$$font>
since it approaches very much to their Nature , and is in a manner kept
tame in many Places . BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.33

Among the common Fowls , the Chicken , the Green Goose and the Duckling
differ from the full-grown of their Kinds , in the same manner as Lamb
from Mutton , Veal from Beef , and the like . BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.34

Among the wild Fowl are to be reckoned the Wild Duck and its Kind , the
Teal and Widgeon ; the Woodcock , Snipe , and Partridge ; the Pigeon ,
Lark and other small Birds . BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.35

The other lesser Particulars will be enumerated in their proper <P_5>
Months , with the Ways of dressing : BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.36

This is a general Table . BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.37

Fish are extremely numerous , BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.38

and they fall under two distinct Heads , as they are had from the <font>
Sea <$$font> or <font> fresh Waters . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.39

From the Sea we have <font> Turbot , Cod , Soal , Haddock , Doree ,
<$$font> and a Multitude of others ; down to the Whiting and Herring ,
and that small but elegant Fish , the Smelt . BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.40

The fresh Waters afford the <font> Pike <$$font> and <font> Pearch ,
<$$font> the <font> Carp <$$font> and <font> Tench , Salmon , Trout
<$$font> , and <font> Eels , <$$font> with others down to the <font>
Gudgeon <$$font> . BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.41

And to these we are to add the <font> Shell-Fish <$$font> of the Sea ;
the <font> Oyster , Escalop , Cockle , <$$font> and the like ; and those
Kinds which are called <font> Crustaceous Fish , <$$font> such as the
<font> Lobster <$$font> and <font> Crab , <$$font> as well as others ,
down to the <font> Shrimp , <$$font> from the Sea , and the <font>
Cray-Fish <$$font> from the fresh Waters . BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.42

We come last to the fresh Provisions from the Garden ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.43

these come in a lower Class than the others , because they are rather
Additions to Dishes than such themselves , BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.44

but they are of great Value . BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.45

Among the principal Greens may be reckoned the <font> Cabbage , Brocoli
, Cauliflower <$$font> and <font> Spinage , <$$font> to which we may add
, <font> Celeri , Lettuce , Radish <$$font> and <font> Salleting ;
Asparagus , Beans , Pease , <$$font> and <font> French Beans . <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.46

Among Roots we have the <font> Carrot , Parsnip , Turnip <$$font> and
<font> Potatoe . <$$font> And among Fruits the <font> Apple , Pear ,
Plumb , Wallnut , Chestnut <$$font> and <font> Filberd <$$font> ; with
the <font> Melon , <$$font> and <font> Cucumber <$$font> ; Fruits of the
Kitchen Garden . BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.47

This is in one View a general Table of these Provisions ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.48

and may be called <font> A Bill of Fare for the Year . <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.49

It is the first Thing the House-Keeper should have before her Eye ,
because it should be always in her Memory . BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.50

None of the Catalogues are here compleat in the lesser Articles ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.51

for that is the Business of the succeeding Parts of the Book , in which
we treat of the Months in which the Things are particularly in , Season
; BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.52

and here it would have loaded and perplexed the Memory .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.53

These are the best and principal <P_6> Kinds , BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.54

and are proper Resources of a Table : BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.55

So much therefore ought never to be out of the Person's Thoughts who is
to provide . BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.56

<heading>

CHAP. II . BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.58

<font> Of foreign Articles pickled or otherwise preserved . <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.59

<$$heading>

Next to the Provisions themselves , the Cook will have Occasion to
recollect what those Things are which serve to give them Flavour , or to
eat with them as Additions in Sauce , or such as supply the Place of it
. BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.61

Under this Head come Pickles , and other preserved Things of that Kind ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.62

Of these there is a vast Number , BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.63

but the greater Part of them are prepared at Home .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.64

Some we receive from other Countries . BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.65

The former Kind will be treated of hereafter in their Places , according
to the Times they are in Season . BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.66

The latter , or foreign , we shall speak of here . BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.67

These are principally six , Anchovies , Capers , Caviar , Cayan Pepper ,
Mangoes , and Soy . BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.68

Of these we shall give some Account under their several Names , each in
a separate Article , shewing their Nature and Origin .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.69

<heading>

ARTICLE I . BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.71

<font> ANCHOVIES . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.72

<$$heading>

The Anchovy is a small Sea fish somewhat like a Pilchard , but of a
distinct Kind ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.74

it's proper Name is Encrasicholus . BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.75

It is preserved with Salt and it's own Juices , which dissolving the
Salt make with it that very rich and high Pickle in which we see it .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.76

It is caught upon the Coasts of Provence and Catalonia three Months in
the Year , BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.77

these are May , June , and July . BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.78

It does not appear there before May , BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.79

and toward the End of July it goes up the <P_7> Straights of Gibraltar
into the Mediterranean , BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.80

and is seen no more till the following Summer . BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.81

They are caught in the Night-time by Means of a Light .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.82

The Fishermen go out in small Vessels with Lanthorns at the Stern .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.83

The Flame brings the Anchovies about , BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.84

and they take them in their Nets . BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.85

When caught they have very little farther Trouble with them .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.86

They cut off the Heads , BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.87

for they are bitter , the Gaul lying high ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.88

and they pull out the Guts ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.89

they then lay them regularly in Barrels BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.90

and strew Bay Salt upon them , Layer upon Layer . BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.91

Nothing more is done , BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.92

for the Richness of their Taste is all their own . BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.93

This shews the Folly of attempting to imitate them with Sprats and other
Fishes . BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.94

What we value in the Anchovy is the fine Flavour of the Fish itself ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.95

no other has it . BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.96

At the Oil Shops they have a Trick of putting right Anchovy Liquor to
pickled Sprats , and then selling them for Anchovies ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.97

and this may deceive the Unwary , BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.98

but no other Way can . BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.99

The finest are those which have the fairest Look , and the richest
Liquor ; that have a red mellow Flesh , and a moist oily Bone .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.100

But the true Way to judge of them is to wash one and open it , and then
taste the pure Flesh . BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.101

This should be high flavoured ; and the Pickle redish and of a high
Flavour also ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.102

if watery and poor , it is not the original Pickle .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.103

This will never suffer the Person who considers the true Taste of an
Anchovy to be deceived . BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.104

Sprats are made to taste like them by the Pickle , BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.105

but that washes off this Way , BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.106

and the Cheat is seen . BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.107

<heading>

ARTICLE II . BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.109

<font> CAPERS . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.110

<$$heading>

Capers are the Flower-Buds of a small Shrub preserved in Pickle .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.112

The Tree which bears them is called the Caper Shrub or Caper Bush ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.113

and is common in the western Parts of Europe : BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.114

We have it also <P_8> in some Gardens . BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.115

But the principal Manufactory for the pickled Capers is near Toulon .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.116

The true high flavoured swelling Capers are the Toulon Kind ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.117

We have some from Lyons , BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.118

but they are flatter and less firm ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.119

and some few are brought from Majorca , BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.120

but they are salt and washy . BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.121

At Toulon , where the finest are made , the Method is this ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.122

they gather the Buds of the Blossoms before they open ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.123

and spread them upon a Floor in a Room where there is no Sun ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.124

and let them lie till they begin to wither ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.125

then they throw them into Tubs of sharp Vinegar , BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.126

and after three Days add a Quantity of Bay Salt . BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.127

When this is dissolved they are fit for packing up for Sale ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.128

and are sent to all Parts of Europe . BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.129

The finest Capers are those of a moderate Size , firm , full and close ,
and such as have the Pickle highly flavoured . BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.130

The soft and flabby , and half open , are of little Value .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.131

<heading>

ARTICLE III . BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.133

<font> CAVIARE . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.134

<$$heading>

Caviare is the Roe of the Sturgeon prepar'd and dry'd .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.136

Sturgeon are prodigiously numerous about the Mouths of Rivers in the
Northern Seas , particularly at the Mouth of the Volga .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.137

They are caught there in vast plenty , and the Flesh eat fresh or
pickled , as we shall shew hereafter . BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.138

The Females are , in the proper Season , as full of Roe as our Carp ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.139

this is taken out , BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.140

they spread it upon great Tables , BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.141

beat it flat , BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.142

and sprinkle Salt upon it immediately ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.143

they let in the Air and Sun , BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.144

and turning it at times it quickly begins to dry : BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.145

When half dry they beat it more , BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.146

and form it into Cakes , which they thoroughly dry in Ovens , though
without . BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.147

In this Condition it is sent all over Russia , BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.148

and vast Quantities are imported here . BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.149

<P_9>

The Italian Merchants settled at Moscow are the people who principally
trade in it . BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.151

We have a great deal of it from Archangel , BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.152

but export the most of it again . BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.153

It is a very high flavoured thing , BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.154

and when good is redish , firm , and strong to the Taste .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.155

When too soft or crumbling , it is always bad . BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.156

<heading>

ARTICLE IV . BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.158

<font> CAYAN PEPPER . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.159

<$$heading>

The Fruit of a Plant of a lively full red Colour , prepar'd by drying
and powdering . BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.161

As we got the taste for Caviare from Russia , we imported this from the
Negroes of our Plantations . BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.162

The Fruit is common in Africa , BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.163

and they having been accustomed to eat it there , shewed our People the
Way in America , BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.164

and they have taught us . BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.165

The Herb which bears this Pod is raised in our Gardens ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.166

its proper Name is Capsicum , BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.167

and from its growing in Africa it is called Guinea Pepper , as Cayan
Pepper from its natural Growth in that Part of America .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.168

The Pods are as long as one's Thumb , and somewhat thicker ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.169

when ripe they are of a smooth , glossy , fine red Colour , whence they
are called Garden Corall . BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.170

We preserve these in the way of a Pickle at home ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.171

the Method shall be shewn in its proper Place . BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.172

We are here speaking of the Powder made of them abroad , and imported .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.173

This is call'd Cayan Pepper , and by some improperly Cayanne Butter .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.174

The Pods are gathered when full ripe and split open ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.175

the Seeds are taken out , and the split Pods laid to dry in the Sun .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.176

When thoroughly dry it is beat to a coarse Powder .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.177

This Powder is Cayan Pepper in the plainest Way , BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.178

but there are many Varieties of it . BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.179

Some mix Bay Salt with it , and others Powder of dry'd Mushroons :
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.180

These three Kinds are made from the common Plant which is called by the
Indians Chili , and Chilcotes . BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.181

<P_10>

But besides this there are three distinct Sorts made from so many
different Species of the Plant , and varying in Strength and Sharpness .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.183

The first of these is made from a small Pod of a yellowish red when ripe
. BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.184

This is sharper than the common Sort , BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.185

and is call'd by them Chilterpin . BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.186

The second is made from a larger Pod , which though red when ripe is
often gathered while green ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.187

this is moderately hot , but with a very fine Flavour :
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.188

They call this Tonalchiles . BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.189

The last Kind is the mildest of all ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.190

it is a short but thicker Pod , BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.191

and is called Chilpelagua . BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.192

We seldom have any but the common Kind brought over here ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.193

but the second Sort here mention'd is much better .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.194

When this Pepper is to be bought , the Person must examine whether it be
genuine , for a great deal is adulterated ; and in the next Place
whether it be pure or have Salt mix'd with it ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.195

for this naturally reduces the Value by encreasing the Quantity .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.196

We have of late try'd the making it here , by drying our own Capsicum
Pods from the Gardens ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.197

this does not come up to the Heat or Flavour of the Foreign ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.198

but mix'd with Bay Salt and Mushroon Powder , it makes a very mild and
pretty Kind . BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.199

The French use these Pods fresh in making of Vinegar , to give it a
Sharpness , BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.200

and they also pickle and preserve them : BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.201

Pickled they are very fine , as we shall shew hereafter .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.202

CHAP. III . BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.204

<font> Of Spices and other Ingredients used in pickling and preserving
at Home . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.205

<$$heading>

The two great Ingredients used in all pickling and preserving are <font>
Vinegar <$$font> and <font> Sugar . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.207

The first of these being made at Home we shall treat of <P_11> hereafter
, shewing the Manner of making it , it's various Kinds , and it's
Distillation . BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.208

At present we treat of Things brought from abroad , of which Sugar is
properly one , BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.209

for though refined here , it is the Produce of another Part of the World
, BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.210

The Spices and various Kinds of Salt , are the other chief Ingredients
used in this Article ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.211

and as the former are entirely brought from abroad , and most of the
others , we shall treat of them together . BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.212

We shall begin with the Spices , because they are used both in pickling
and preserving , and thence come to the Salts , treating of the Sugars
separately at last . BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.213

The principal Spices used in England are <font> Cloves , Mace , Nutmegs
, Cinnamon , Ginger , Pepper , <$$font> and that Fruit called <font>
Allspice , <$$font> or Jamaica Pepper , which has the Flavour of them
all . BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.214

In the East_Indies , as we have observed , they use Galangals ,
Turmerick , and several other Drugs under the same Name ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.215

but these we have nothing to do with in this Account .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.216

We shall treat of the others in so many separate Articles .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.217

<heading>

ARTICLE I . BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.219

<font> CLOVES . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.220

<$$heading>

The Clove is the Produce of a large and beautiful Tree ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.222

and is the unripe Fruit with the Cup of the Flower ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.223

the Tree has Leaves like the Bay , and very finely flavoured both for
Smell and Taste ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.224

the Clove is green at the first Appearance , BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.225

but it soon grows brownish BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.226

and is then gathered , very long before it comes toward Ripeness ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.227

what are left on the Trees grow very large , BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.228

and alter their Shape ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.229

they are call'd the Mother of Cloves . BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.230

The unripe Fruit is gathered in the Middle of the Day and laid in a
shady , airy Place to dry , BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.231

and nothing else is done to it . BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.232

<P_12>

We have Cloves from the Dutch ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.234

they have destroyed the Trees in the Molucca Islands , and propagated
them in their Island of Ternate ; so that they supply all the European
Nations . BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.235

The Tree is called Caryophyllus , which is also the Name of the Fruit .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.236

The best Cloves are such as are dry , brittle , dark coloured , and
fiery hot to the Taste , and of a quick Smell . BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.237

<font> MACE and NUTMEG . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.240

<$$heading>

These , though two Spices , and very different in Form and Appearance ,
are to be treated of together , because they are both produced by the
same Tree , and are two Parts of one and the same Fruit .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.242

The Nutmeg Tree is large and beautiful , BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.243

the Leaves are long and of a fine green , BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.244

and the Flower is like an Apple Blossom ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.245

the Fruit is round , and of the Bigness of a Peach , which it in all
Respects resembles . BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.246

The fleshy Part is not valued , BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.247

but within it , by Way of Kernel , lies the Nutmeg , which is covered
with the Mace ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.248

the Fruit is cut open , the Mace opened and taken off , and that and the
Nutmeg dried in a cool airy Place , and then sent over to us .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.249

Some distinguish the Nutmeg into Male and Female .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.250

In this Case the common Nutmeg is called the Female ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.251

the other is longish and less valuable . BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.252

They are produced by the same Tree , but the Male by such as are less
cultivated . BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.253

It is the Produce of the East-Indies . BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.254

The best Mace is that which is oily , soft , and fragrant .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.255

The Nutmeg should be found , hard , and heavy , of a pale Colour on the
Outside , and finely marbled within . BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.256

The Nutmegs differ according to the Season of gathering ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.257

the best are those gathered in April . BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.258

The Dutch supply us with Nutmegs and Mace , as they do <P_13> with
Cloves ; the whole Spice Trade being in a Manner in their Hands .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.259

ARTICLE III . BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.261

<font> CINNAMON . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.262

<$$heading>

Cinnamon is the inner Bark of a large and beautiful Tree which grows in
the East-Indies ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.264

the Leaves are like those of the Bay Tree , and of a very fine , and
spicey Taste , and most agreeable Smell . BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.265

The Bark , when fresh , has little Taste BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.266

it gains a great deal of it's Flavour as it dries .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.267

It is the most agreeable of all the Spices ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.268

the finest is that which is in small Quills , of a bright Colour and
strong Smell , and of a sharp and biting Taste . BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.269

Sometimes an Oil is drawn from Cinnamon before it is brought over to us
; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.270

then , it is very insipid : BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.271

And often Cassia Bark is sold among it , BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.272

but that is much inferior in Value ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.273

the Taste is the true Way to judge , BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.274

for that which has lost it's Oil is less sharp and quick than it should
be ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.275

and the Cassia comes to a Kind of Jelly after holding some Time in the
Mouth . BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.276

The Dutch supply all Europe with Cinnamon , which they have in the
Islands of Ceylon in such Abundance that they burn a great deal annually
to keep up the Price . BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.277

CHAP. IV . BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.279

<font> Of the Nature of Foods , and suiting them to Constitutions .
<$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.280

<$$heading>

Although the pleasing of the Palate be the main End in Books of Cookery
, we carry the Consideration in this a little farther .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.282

We shall throughout have Regard to the Health as well as the Appetite :
BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.283

For it is of greater Concern ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.284

neither can the other . <P_14> exist without it .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.285

If there were any Man so devoted to his Pleasure in eating , that he
consulted no other , yet the Care of his Health becomes a Part of that ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.286

for if sick he can@ @not relish his Food . BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.287

Constitutions are various , BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.288

and they require a different Kind of Diet to keep them well .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.289

Nature has provided in the same manner a great Variety of Foods :
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.290

Our Business is to suit these to one another . BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.291

There is no Way to do this but by understanding both ; which we shall
endeavour here to explain in a very short Compass .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.292

In general Meat is of the heaviest , Fowls of a lighter , and Fish of
the lightest Kind ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.293

they are easy of Digestion in Proportion as they are light in their
Nature ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.294

but on the other Hand they are a richer and stronger Nourishment when
they are of a firmer Texture . BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.295

Thus the richest Foods are the several Kinds of Flesh Meat , though
there are some of the Fish kinds extremely nourishing .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.296

The Shell_Fish are a Class distinct from all the others , and of a
peculiar Nature , easy of Digestion , and very nourishing .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.297

This is a general Idea of the Nature of Foods : BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.298

We are next to enquire into the Differences of Constitutions , for the
suiting one to the other . BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.299

There are two Ways in which the Food is to be suited to the Constitution
; BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.300

the one is for the Recovery of Health ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.301

this rather falls under the Consideration of the Physician ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.302

however we shall give some Directions concerning it , so far as is
consistent with our Plan : BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.303

The other is for the preserving of Health , BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.304

and this comes directly and immediately in our Way ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.305

and should be one material End in all Works of this Kind .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.306

Constitutions depend upon the Temperament of the Body ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.307

and may be divided into four Kinds , with respect to the Effects of Food
. BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.308

These are the <font> Sanguine , <$$font> the <font> Bilious , <$$font>
the <font> Phlegmatick , <$$font> and the <font> Melancholick .
<$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.309

The two first are in some Degree ally'd to one another , and the two
other more . BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.310

This is all the Distinction <P_15> needful for the Consideration of
appropriating the Food ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.311

and therefore the general Direction will divide Eatables for this
Purpose only into two Heads ; one Class of them being fit for the
Sanguine and Bilious ; and other for the Phlegmatick and Melancholick ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.312

and these two Classes are to be again divided , according to their
particular Kinds , into such as are fittest for the one ; and such as
agree best with the other of the two lesser Distinctions .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.313

The Nature of these several Constitutions is this .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.314

The Person who is <font> Sanguine <$$font> has a good Colour in his
Cheeks and a moderate Quantity of Flesh upon his Body ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.315

and is naturally of an easy Temper and chearful Disposition .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.316

He who is of a bilious Constitution has a more set Colour in his Face ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.317

he is thinner in Flesh , and his Temper naturally quick and hasty .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.318

These are the two Constitutions which are somewhat allied to one another
; BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.319

the sanguine is the most healthful , and most agreeable ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.320

and the bilious is a Fault of it . BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.321

The Person who is phlegmatick is of a pale Complexion , moderately
fleshy , BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.322

but the Flesh is not firm , and his Temper naturally sedate ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.323

he is dull and inactive , BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.324

and is the very opposite of the bilious Constitution .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.325

The Melancholick Constitution shews itself by a lean Body , and little
Colour in the Cheeks ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.326

the Temper attending this Constitution is generally a grave and severe
Disposition , BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.327

and the Person is apt to be absent , solitary , and careless .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.328

A Man is most perfectly healthful when he can@ @not be properly said to
be of any one of these Constitutions but when he is in a middle Degree
between them : As that Temper is best which is neither so quick as in
the bilious , nor so slow as in the phlegmatick Person ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.329

so that State of Body is most healthful in which a Man is neither so red
in the Cheeks as in the first , or so pale as in the latter .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.330

What is called the sanguine Constitution , when in a moderate Degree ,
is <P_16> the most healthful ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.331

but it is seldom called by that Name , except when it somewhat exceeds
that Degree . BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.332

A Man should first acquaint himself with his Constitution , which he may
do by this short Account , examining himself according to these Articles
; BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.333

and when he knows this , he is to manage his Diet in such a Manner as to
be continually improving his Health by moderating the Occasions of
whatever is redundant , whether Blood , Gall , or whatever .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.334

And thus he will escape the murderous Hand of the Physician .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.335

The Regulation of the Diet , and the proper Use of Exercise , are the
right Restorers of Health ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.336

the Effect of Medicines is too violent ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.337

and with due Care in this Respect they will be rarely needed .

We shall divide the particular Bill of Fare for every Month under
certain Heads , as we did the general Table of Provisions , and in each
enumerate not only what Kind is in Season , but what Parts or Joints are
most handsome at Table ; in what Manner they appear best , and with what
Additions . BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.345

We shall begin with the most substantial . BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.346

Soups are made from this Kind , BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.347

<font> BUTCHERS MEAT . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.352

<$$heading>

<font> Beef <$$font> is a kind of Standard Dish , and in Season more or
less throughout the whole Year . BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.354

At this Time the Sirloin , or some other good Piece roasted , with
Horse-radish , or the Rump or Ach-Bone boil'd with Greens look well .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.355

From the same Source we have also for this time Tongue and Udder .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.356

A Brisket of Beef stew'd is also proper . BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.357

A Chine of Mutton roasted is also good , or any of the other handsome
Joint . BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.358

Veal supplies many very good and proper Dishes ; as the Loin , Neck , or
Fillet roasted ; the Knuckle boiled with Bacon and Greens , the Head
boil'd in the same manner , or roasted , and Ragouts and Scots Collops .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.359

<$$heading>

We see the Land and Waters afford plenty of Provisions at this Season ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.395

nor can we want Herbs and Roots : BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.396

Fruit is one of the Articles least numerous at this dead time ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.397

yet we are not without a Supply for the Table . BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.398

There are several excellent Pears in Season now , as the Lessacherie ,
Colmar , Virgoleuse , Ambrette , Epine d'Hyver , St. Germain , St.
Austin , Winter Beurre , Citron d'Hyver , Rousselette d'Hyver ,
Francreal , and Bugi ; the Rouville , Patail , Besiy de <P_19> Caissoy ,
and the Beside Cheaumontelle . BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.399

These are for eating ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.400

they keep them on Espaliers , where they hang longer than on Walls .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.401

For baking there are the Cadillac , the black Worcester Pear , the

Grapes are also to be had with proper Care : BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.405

The Way is to cut the Bunches with a Knot or Shoot , and hang them
separate in a dry airy Room . BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.406

These are the Things in Season for the Month of <font> January .
<$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.407

The Housekeeper sees what she may command , BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.408

CHAP. VI . BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.411

<font> Of the Art of Marketing and chusing Fresh Provisions . <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.412

<$$heading>

The great Number of Articles will necessarily render this a long Chapter
, BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.414

but we shall separate it into several Divisions .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.415

We have shewn what is in Season in January , BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.416

and the Housekeeper is to consider what she will purchase :
BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.417

the next Care is how to chuse it , BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.418

for there are good and bad of all Kinds ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.419

and if the Provision is not good in itself , no dressing can make it so
. BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.420

Those who sell are ready to impose upon the Buyer ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.421

she is therefore to be guided by just <P_20> Rules in every Article ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.422

and must trust to her own Reason , not their Speeches .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.423

- We shall begin with Butchers Meat . BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.424

<heading>

ARTICLE I . BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.426

<font> Of chusing BEEF <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.427

<$$heading>

In order to buy Beef , the first Thing is to know rightly what are the
Joints and Pieces . BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.429

The first Division is into three Parts , the Quarters , the Head , and
the Entrails . BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.430

The Quarters are two , the <font> Fore <$$font> and the <font> Hind ;
<$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.431

in the Fore Quarter there is the Haunch ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.432

this is a large Piece , BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.433

and includes what may be called four Joints ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.434

these are , the <font> Clod , <$$font> the <font> Marrow-bone , <$$font>
the <font> Shin , <$$font> and , the <font> Sticking-piece . <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.435

Next to the Haunch comes what is called the Leg of Mutton Piece ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.436

this has Part of the Blade Bone . BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.437

Then there are these four , the Chuck-piece , the Brisket , the Fore
Ribs , and the Middle Rib . BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.438

This last is what is called the Chuck Rib . BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.439

These Pieces compose the Fore Quarter . BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.440

In the Hind Quarter there are fewer , BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.441

but they are much finer Pieces ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.442

there are the Sirloin , the Rump , the Thick Flank , the Thin Flank ,
the Veiny Piece , the Chuck Bone , the Buttock , and the Leg .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.443

After these Quarters may be named the <font> Head , <$$font> which
consists of the Cheek , Tongue , and Palate ; and the <font> Entrails
<$$font> which are , the Sweat-bread and Kidneys ; then the Skirt and
Tripe ; of these Kinds the Double , the Roll , and the Reed Tripe .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.444

Beef is of three Kinds , <font> Ox , Cow , <$$font> and <font> Bull .
<$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.445

The first is vastly the best , the latter scarce ever brought to Market
. BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.446

As to Cow Beef it's Degree of Goodness depends upon the Age ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.447

a Cow past Use is fattened and killed , BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.448

and this is poor : BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.449

But the Beef of a young Heifer is very nearly as good as that of the Ox
. BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.450

The Housekeeper is therefore to buy Ox Beef , or young Heifer :
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.451

We shall not advise her to take the Butcher's <P_21> Word , but shew how
she may know one from the other . BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.452

In this Article of Marketing to avoid perplexing the Memory , we shall
speak only of those Things we have before mentioned as being in Season
this Month , and afterwards in the proper Months of the others .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.453

The Grain of Beef is a great Mark ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.454

Ox Beef has a fine open Grain ; Cow Beef a lesser ; and Bull Beef the
closest Grain of all . BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.455

When Ox Beef is perfectly fine , the Lean is of a bright red , the Fat
whitish , and the Sewet perfectly white . BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.456

When this Beef is young , the Fat is soft and oily .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.457

The Lean of Cow Beef is paler than the Ox , BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.458

the Bones are smaller ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.459

as to the Fat , that is no Mark , BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.460

for it is rather whiter than in the Ox BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.461

To know whether it be young press it with the Finger .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.462

In the Heifer Beef the Mark , will rise and fill up at once , not so in
old Cow Beef . BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.463

As to Bull Beef it is of a dark red , and so hard the Finger will scarce
press it ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.464

the Fat is gross , BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.465

and has a strong Scent . BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.466

ART. II . BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.468

<font> MUTTON . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.469

<$$heading>

The Sheep is divided into three Parts like the Ox , the Quarters , the
Head , and the Entrails . BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.471

The Fore Quarter contains the Shoulder , Neck , and Breast ; the Hind
Quarter , the Leg , and the Loin ; except when the two Loins are cut
together , Saddle-Fashion ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.472

the Head and Entrails are usually sold together , the latter being
called the Pluck . BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.473

This contains the Liver , Lights , Heart , Sweatbread , and Melt .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.474

More Care is required in chusing Mutton than Beef ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.475

for besides that it is of several Kinds , as Beef , according to the Age
, Condition , and Sex of the Creature , it is very often distempered .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.476

The Rot is a common Disorder in Sheep , BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.477

and the Flesh of such as have it is unwholsome . BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.478

To know this , observe the <P_22> Colour of the Meat ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.479

the Lean is very pale_coloured , and the Fat yellowish ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.480

and the whole is loose at the Bone . BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.481

For trying it farther , let it be squeezed hard , and there will come
out some Drops like Dew upon the Surface . BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.482

To know whether Mutton have not been kept too long , examine in this
Manner ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.483

seek for the Vein in the Neck in a Fore Quarter , BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.484

and observe it's Colour ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.485

it should be red or Violet_coloured ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.486

it is always thus when the Meat is perfectly fresh ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.487

if it looks yellowish , the whole is going ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.488

and if it be green , it is too far gone for Use .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.489

The Fore Quarter consists of the Neck , the Breast , and the Shoulder ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.490

the Hind Quarter is composed only of the Leg and the Loin ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.491

or the two Loins may be cut together ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.492

this Piece is called a Saddle of Mutton from it's Shape , resembling a
Saddle ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.493

and when it is small fat Mutton , this is an excellent Joint .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.494

This was the first Kind that was cut so ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.495

they now cut the largest and coarsest Meat in that Manner ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.496

and it looks very well ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.497

to know whether this Part be sweet smell under the Kidney ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.498

if any thing be amiss , it will be perceived there .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.499

A good Method also is to bend the Knuckle of the Leg ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.500

if that be stiff , the Meat is fresh ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.501

but if it be very limber , 't@ @is a very ill Sign .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.502

As to the different kinds of Mutton , the finest is that which feeds
upon dry hilly Pastures , where the Air is clear and the Grass short and
sweet ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.503

this is small and finely flavoured , BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.504

and the best Age for killing is between five and six Years .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.505

Most of the Mutton that is eat , is spoiled by being killed too young .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.506

Weather Mutton is best . BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.507

The Fat of this is white and firm , BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.508

and parts easily from the Lean ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.509

and the Lean is of a fine Red and a proper Firmness , neither so hard as
not to give Way under the Finger , nor so soft as to wrinkle upon being
touched ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.510

the best Mutton is that which feels tender and somewhat firm , and that
when dented with a Finger quickly rises again . BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.511

Ram Mutton is like Bull Beef , BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.512

but it is oftener sold ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.513

the Lean is very red and of a rough Grain , BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.514

and the Fat is spungy . BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.515

<P_23>

The longer Mutton is kept , provided it be sweet , the better ,
especially a Leg . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.517

<heading>

ART. III . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.519

<font> VEAL . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.520

<$$heading>

The Calf is divided , like the Sheep , into the fore and hind Quarters ,
the Head and Entrails . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.522

The fore Quarter contains , in the same Manner , the Shoulder ; Breast ,
and Neck , and the hind Quarter {TEXT:Quarrer} , the Leg and Loin :
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.523

But the Leg is usually divided into two Parts , the Fillet and the
Knuckle . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.524

The Head is split , and sold entire , and in halves .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.525

The Entrails are very fine ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.526

all together they are called the Pluck , BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.527

but they are sold also separate ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.528

they are the Heart , Liver , Lights and Milt , the Skirts , and the two
Sweet-Breads . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.529

As to the Choice , first observe that the Bull-Calf , and Cow-Calf
differ , the latter being much the finest ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.530

Then besides this natural Difference , there is a great deal owing to
the Artifice of the Feeder and the Butcher ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.531

for they use more in Veal than in any other Article .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.532

The Bull-Calf has a firm , reddish , and somewhat larger Grain ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.533

and the Fat is wrinkled : BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.534

The Flesh of the Cow-Calf is whiter , evener , and of a finer Grain ,
and the Fat smooth . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.535

They wrap up the Veal in Cloths to whiten it , BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.536

and therefore the Buyer must smell if it be not musty .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.537

Veal taints sooner than any other Meat , BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.538

therefore she must see that it be not going when bought ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.539

for then it will soon be gone . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.540

The Loin taints under the Kidney , and the Neck and Breast at the upper
Part , BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.541

this is the Place therefore to be examined . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.542

The Rules laid down for Mutton hold also here , BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.543

the ruddy Colour of the Neck Vein , and the Stiffness of the Knuckle
Joint , are Proofs of Freshness . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.544

When there is a blackish or greenish Look on any Part , it is surely
going . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.545

Good Veal , if ever so young , has a proper Firmness ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.546

when it is soft and flabby it is decaying . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.547

The Sweet-Bread is always good when it is firm and dry ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.548

when it is flabby and clammy it is spoil'd . BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.549

<P_24>

For the Choice of a Calf's Head examine the Eyes ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.551

if they be plump and lively it is fresh , BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.552

if sunk in or wrinkled it is gone . BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.553

<heading>

ART. IV . BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.555

<font> LAMB . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.556

<$$heading>

Lamb is divided in the same Manner as Mutton , into the fore and hind
Quarters , the Head and Entrails ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.558

but under this last Head there is some Distinction .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.559

The fore Quarter is the Neck , Breast and Shoulder , which are usually
roasted together , the Quarter being considered as a Joint .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.560

In the hind Quarter are the Leg and Loin , BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.561

but they are often separated , BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.562

House Lamb is in high Season this Month . BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.563

The Head and common Entrails are usually sold together , under the Name
of Head and Pluck , or Head and Appurtenances . BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.564

But there is the Fry also ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.565

this is composed of the Lamb-Stones , Sweetbreads , Skirts , and the
finest Part of the Liver . BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.566

Lamb is to be chosen as Veal ; the Quarters by the Sweetness under the
Kidney , and Freshness of the Neck Vein , and by the Firmness of the
Knuckle Joint . BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.567

The Head is to be chosen by the Eyes , as the Calf's ; and the Entrails
by smelling . BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.568

<heading>

ART. V . BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.570

<font> PORK . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.571

<$$heading>

We have observed that the Hog is to be consider'd in three Conditions ;
for Bacon , the Porker , and the Sucking Pig . BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.573

We shall hereafter treat of the Bacon Hog and of the Pig separately ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.574

we here speak of the Porker . BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.575

This is divided as the others into the fore and hind Quarters , the Head
and Entrails ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.576

but there is great Difference in the cutting up of these ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.577

in the fore Quarter there is the Fore-Loin and the Spring ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.578

and where the Porker is large they cut a Spearrib .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.579

The hind Quarter consists of the Leg and Loin . BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.580

The Head is like the Hog's , BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.581

and is frequently sous'd ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.582

the Entrails <P_25> are numerous , BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.583

and several of them together are called the Haslet ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.584

this properly consists of the Liver and Crow , and the Kidneys and
Skirts , rolled up in the Caul . BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.585

The Chitterlings are also to be counted among the Entrails , and the
Guts which serve for Sausages . BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.586

The Age of the Porker is a great Article , BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.587

for if it be too old the Meat is bad ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.588

but there is a farther Caution also necessary , the same as in Mutton ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.589

for the Porker , like the Sheep , is subject to Disorders , which render
the Meat unwholesome . BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.590

We shall shew how to chuse it so as to avoid both Faults .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.591

When the Porker is young , the Skin is tender , the Fat fine and smooth
, and the Lean soft and moist . BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.592

When this is harsh , the Fat firm , and the Skin hard , it is old .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.593

When there are a great Number of small Kernels in the Fat , the Creature
has been distempered ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.594

this is nearly rotten , BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.595

and should not be eaten , BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.596

for it is unwholesome . BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.597

One Thing in particular makes the Pork bad , BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.598

that is when the Hog has not been gelt till he was grown_up .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.599

This should be done while they are very young , BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.600

and the Flesh is then always fine and tender ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.601

the Flesh is otherwise harder and reder than of the right Porker ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.602

and has a very disagreeable Rankness . BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.603

The Skin of this Sort of Pork is thicker , tougher , and coarser than
that of the other , BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.604

and does not join so closely to the Flesh . BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.605

To know whether Pork be fresh we judge in the same Way as in other Meats
, by the . Sweetness ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.606

it taints first at the Bone that comes out in the Hands and Legs ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.607

and if one thrusts a Finger in there it will be sure to make a Discovery
on smelling when taken out . BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.608

When it grows stale also , the Skin is damp and flabby .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.609

ART. VI . BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.612

<font> Of the BACON HOG . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.613

<$$heading>

The grown Hog is divided differently from all other Beasts , because of
the Bacon , and other particular Uses , as Ham , pickled Pieces , and
the like . BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.615

The principal Pieces for eating fresh are three , the Spearrib , the
Chine , and the Griskin ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.616

the principal Entrails are called the Liver and Crow , which are good
fried , BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.617

and the Feet and Ears are good souced ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.618

the rest is as the Porker , BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.619

and need not be repeated . BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.620

As to the Choice of the fresh Meat it is altogether the same as that of
Pork ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.621

but there are particular Ways of judging of Bacon .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.622

When it is good the Flesh sticks close to the Bones ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.623

and the Fat and Lean stick close to one another .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.624

If this be not the Case it is bad , BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.625

and 't@ @is suspicious that the Hog Was not found .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.626

The next Care must be , that the Bacon be not rusty , nor tending to it
; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.627

to find this , examine the Fat that lies next to the Rind ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.628

if that be dusky it is bad , BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.629

for it should be as white as any other Part ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.630

the Lean also should be red and firm ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.631

when it is Soft and pale the Bacon is getting rusty .

We have done with those Meats that are cut and separated into Joints ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.637

and come to Animals sold entire . BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.638

The roasting Pig is not divided at all , BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.639

and very little is to be said as to it's Choice ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.640

it should be young , fat , and newly killed ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.641

it is not like other Meats that are good as long as they are sweet ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.642

the Pig loses Part of it's Goodness every Hour after it is killed ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.643

to be in Perfection it should always be killed in the Morning to eat at
Dinner , BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.644

ART. VIII . BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.647

<font> Of the Hare . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.648

<$$heading>

The Hare is considered in two Lights , in Respect of it's Age , and it's
Freshness . BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.650

The Age distinguishes it into two Kinds , the Leveret and Hare ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.651

and it may be thus known . BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.652

Feel the fore Legs , and there will be found a Knob on each in the
Leveret , which comes out in the grown Hare ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.653

observe the Cleft of the Lip , BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.654

if it be small and close 't@ @is a Leveret ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.655

if wide , large , and spreading , 't@ @is an old Hare .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.656

Next examine the Ears , BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.657

if they tear easily the Hare is young ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.658

if they be tough it is an old one . BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.659

Lastly , look to the Feet , BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.660

if the Claws be close and smooth 't@ @is a Leveret ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.661

if far apart and ragged the Hare is old . BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.662

These Rules will never fail . BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.663

As to the Freshness it is thus known ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.664

if the Body be stiff and the Flesh pale , it is newly killed
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.665

when the Flesh is blackish , and the Body limber , it is growing stale ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.666

but 't@ @is never bad till it smells . BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.667

The Rabbit is like the Hare in Shape , BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.672

and it is to be examined in the same Manner ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.673

it's Goodness depends upon it's being young and sweet .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.674

To know the Age , examine first the Fur , BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.675

if that be delicate and lie smooth , it is a Sign of Youth ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.676

if it be rough and staring , 't@ @is suspicious the Rabbit is old .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.677

Next look to the Feet , BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.678

if the Claws be short and smooth it is a young one ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.679

if they be long , and especially if they be rough and ragged , there is
no Doubt but it is an old one . BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.680

<P_28>

To judge of the Freshness , first smell that it be not musty ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.682

then see that the Flesh be white , clean , and dry , and the Joints
stiff ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.683

when growing stale , the Joints become limber , and the Flesh damp and
flabby . BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.684

CHAP. VII . BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.686

<font> Of Store Dishes , and the Manner of chusing them . <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.687

<$$heading>

Under the Denomination of Store Dishes , come those Articles of the
Flesh or Fish kind , which are kept in the House to be ready on all
Occasions . BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.689

Some of these can only be bought , because we have no Opportunity of
making them , as Sturgeon and the like ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.690

others may be either bought or made , as Hams , some being foreign and
others English . BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.691

We shall hereafter deliver the Method of making such as can be prepared
at home : BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.692

In this Place we are following the Directions given in the last Chapter
for chusing fresh Provisions , with such as are proper for these .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.693

This Section treats only of Marketing . BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.694

ART. I . BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.696

<font> Of STURGEON . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.697

<$$heading>

Sturgeon is a vast Fish , sometimes brought fresh to Market , but most
usually pickled ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.699

it is not comparable when fresh to what it is when well pickled ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.700

but we have a great deal that is very poor , and of little Flavour .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.701

To chuse it , see that it be firm and of an even Grain ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.702

to try this , cut it evenly through with a sharp Knife ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.703

if good it cuts tough and firm , BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.704

and seems a little oily : BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.705

if bad , it will break and fall into Pieces , and feel harsh and brittle
. BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.706

The Colour also is a good Rule for judging ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.707

it should be white , with here and there a blue Vein , and the Gristles
blue ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.708

such as is brown or yellow is bad . BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.709

Finally , a good Way of knowing its Value is by the Skin ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.710

when Sturgeon is <P_29> fine this is tender , well-colour'd ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.711

and feels soft ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.712

but when it is harsh , tough , and dry , 't@ @is an ill Sign .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.713

The Smell of Sturgeon also shews its Goodness , BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.714

for when perfectly fine , it has a light pleasant Scent ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.715

and when bad , it is rank , heavy and disagreeable .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.716

There is no Article that requires more Care and Nicety in the Choice
than Sturgeon , BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.717

for when perfectly fine , it is one of the most delicate Fish in the
World , BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.718

but when it is at all defective , 't@ @is very poor , and often quite
disagreeable , BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.719

Three Things shew the Goodness of Pickled Salmon ; First , the
Brightness of the Scales and their sticking fast to the Skin . Second ,
the Firmness of the Flesh ; and , third , its fine red Colour .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.724

When the Scales rub off easily , and have a dull Aspect , the Fish has
been bad when pickled ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.725

and if the Flesh be whitish , crumbly , and break in little rough Flakes
, it has been ill pickled , or in a bad Season . BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.726

When Salmon is perfectly fine , the Flesh always is glossy , and as it
were oily , BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.727

and it parts in large regular Flakes , with a delicate and lively Colour
. BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.728

ART. III . BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.730

<font> Of PICKLED HERRINGS . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.731

<$$heading>

The Goodness of a Pickled Herring is known by the Colour of the Bone and
the Texture of the Flesh : BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.733

To try them , let them be cut open to the Back ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.734

if the Flesh be mellow , soft , and oily , and of a good clear Colour ;
and the Bone looks clean , and be either white , or of an agreeable red
, they are good . BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.735

If the Flesh be dry , and the Bone looks muddy , they are bad .

ART. IV . BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.739

<font> Of RED HERRINGS . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.740

<$$heading>

Red Herrings are known to be good by their Colour and Smell ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.742

they should be of a bright , clean , yellowish Hue , and look glossy :
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.743

The Smell should be brisk and pleasant , BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.744

and when cut open , the Flesh should easily Part from the Bone .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.745

When they are of a dull Colour they have been ill kept ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.746

and when the Bone will not separate they are never good .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.747

<heading>

ART. V . BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.749

<font> Of SALT COD . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.750

<$$heading>

The Cod is known to be good , in some Degree , like the others already
named ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.752

the Flesh is to be mellow , soft , yet firm and oily ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.753

and the Bone is to separate easily . BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.754

These are the great Marks of Goodness ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.755

the Flesh should break naturally in large and handsome Flakes ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.756

and must not look harsh : BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.757

the Back_Bone must come away freely , BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.758

and the Colour of the Flesh must be a clean good whitish :
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.759

The Smell also assists in judging , BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.760

for when it is rank it is never good . BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.761

The larger and sounder the Flakes , always the finer and more delicate
the Fish . BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.762

<heading>

ART. VI . BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.764

<font> OF LING . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.765

<$$heading>

Ling is to be chosen by its Thickness and Colour ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.767

that which is thickest about the Head is best BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.768

and the true Colour is a fine pale yellow ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.769

It should have a soft even Skin , and part from the Bone regularly ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.770

and there should be some Mellowness in the Flesh .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.771

When the Skin is rough , and the whole Fish very hard and dry , it is
not good . BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.772

These Rules will serve also for judging of all Kinds of salted Fish
whatsoever . BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.773

ART. VII . BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.776

<font> OF HAMS . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.777

<$$heading>

All Hams are so far of the same Kind , that they are made in the same
general Manner , and are liable to the same Defects ; so that one Rule
will serve for judging of them all . BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.779

The Faults of Hams are to be tainted or rusty ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.780

this is to be tried by running a Knife into them .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.781

Let a Carving-Knife with a sharp Point be thrust deep into the Middle of
the Ham , on the Inside under the Bone , BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.782

and observe how it comes out ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.783

first smell to the Hole , BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.784

and if there be an ill Scent at it , the Ham is altogether bad :
BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.785

If the Knife come out clean , and the Flavour on smelling to it be fine
, the Ham is perfect : BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.786

But if it be daubed and smell rank , it is a Proof that the Ham is damp
and tainted within . BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.787

Feel also that the Ham be dry , and that the Flesh stick to the Bone .

ART. VIII . BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.790

<font> Of BRAWN . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.791

<$$heading>

No Brawn is fine but what has been made from a young Boar ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.793

if he be old it is too hard , BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.794

and if a Barrow or Sow were used instead of a Boar , the Brawn never has
due Firmness . BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.795

Examine the Rind , BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.796

if that be firm it is Boar Brawn : BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.797

but if it be too hard the Boar was over aged , BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.798

and it is not so good . BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.799

A very thick Rind also shews it was an old Boar , and a very soft Rind
that it was Sow or Barrow Brawn , which is always vastly inferior .

SECT. III . BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.803

<font> Of Cookery . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.804

<$$heading>

The Mistress of a Family has now seen what Provisions are in Season ,
and how she is to chuse them . BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.806

We suppose them bought , and good in their Kinds ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.807

and are to enter upon the main Subject of this Work , the dressing of
them . BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.808

In all Studies it is the regular Practice to begin with the plainest and
easiest Things , and from these to arise to such as are more difficult
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.809

We shall follow the same Method here , first treating of Roasting and
Boiling , and thence leading the Cook to the most elegant and difficult
Made_Dishes . BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.810

<heading>

CHAP. VIII . BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.812

<font> Of Roasting . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.813

<$$heading>

Cleanliness is the first Article in all Cookery ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.815

this let the Beginner keep always in her Mind , BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.816

and for the first Preparation toward roasting , let the Spit be clean .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.817

It must be properly cleaned , that is with harmless Things ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.818

some rub their Spits with Brick Dust to get off the Dirt ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.819

and others grease them with Oil to keep them from rusting .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.820

Neither of these is to be allowed , BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.821

for they give a Taste to the Meat . BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.822

Let the Spit be cleaned with Sand and Water , nothing else .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.823

When it has been scowered thus , let it be well washed with fair Water ,
and dried with a clean Cloth ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.824

this is , true Cleanliness , BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.825

and is the first Instruction toward roasting . BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.826

<P_33>

The Fire is to be prepared as well as the Spit ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.828

and for this two Things are to be regarded , that it be made up in Time
, and that it be proportioned to the Service . BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.829

The Chymists talk of their several Degrees of Fire ,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.830

but the Cook has more Need to regard them . BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.831

The same Fire that will roast a Sirloin will parch up a lighter Dish .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.832

If the Thing to be roasted be thin and tender , let the Fire be little
and brisk ; BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.833

when a large Thing is to be roasted , let there be a sound good Fire
made ready . BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.834

Let the Cook see that her Fire be all the while clear at the Bottom ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.835

let her give it a gentle Stirring before she lays the Thing down ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.836

and when it is half done let her remove the Spit and Dripping-pan back ,
and rouse it up thoroughly , that it may brisk up for the finishing with
Spirit . BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.837

When the Steam from the Meat is drawn toward the Fire , 't@ @is a Sign
it is near done . BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.838

This is all that need be said of Roasting in general .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.839

We shall deliver the particular Rules for separate Things under these
several Articles . BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.840

<heading>

ARTICLE I . BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.842

<font> Of ROASTING of BEEF . <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.843

<$$heading>

The Fire being proportioned to the Piece to be roasted , the time will
be different in some Measure according to the Season .
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.845

The same Piece will be twenty Minutes or half an hour longer roasting in
frosty Weather than in Summer . BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.846

In general the Time will be thus proportioned to the Quantity ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.847

a Piece of ten Pounds will take an Hour and a Half ; one of twenty Pound
Weight three Hours ; and so in Proportion : BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.848

But the thicker the Piece is in proportion to its Weight , the longer it
must be down . BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.849

This difference is proper to be regarded , BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.850

but it is but little . BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.851
