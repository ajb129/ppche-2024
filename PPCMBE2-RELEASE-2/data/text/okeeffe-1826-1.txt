I was born in Abbey-street , Dublin , on the 24th of June , 1747 ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,1.34

my father was a native of the King's County , and my mother of the
county of Wexford . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,1.35

I was designed by my <P_1,2> parents and my own inclination for a
painter , and not above six years of age when I was placed at Mr.
West's , the Royal Academy , Shaw's-court , Dame-street , Dublin .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.36

West was a Waterford man , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.37

and took his painting-studies in Paris , under Boucher , the disciple of
Le Brun , distinguished for his painted series of Alexander's battles .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.38

My drawing gave me an early taste for the Antique ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.39

and consequently set me reading . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.40

From the Greek , Latin , and French , acquired under Father Austin , to
whose school in Cook-street , I went , my fancy soon strayed to
Shakspeare , old Ben , Congreve , Cibber , and Farquhar .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.41

The first edition of Farquhar's comedies , with the prints affixed to
each of them , set me studying and acting private plays among my
schoolfellows ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.42

and this transition from drawing to poetizing was ultimately <paren> as
my sight began to fail at seven-and-twenty <$$paren> very fortunate for
me : - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.43

a man can compose with his pen in the hand of an amanuensis ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.44

<P_1,3>

but the pencil he must hold in his own hand . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.46

When I was about four years old , there took place in Dublin a most
splendid funeral in honour of the Italian musical composer , Castruccio
; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.47

the procession formed a fine concert , vocal and instrumental , through
the streets . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.48

I got running after it , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.49

and was suddenly struck speechless , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.50

and remained in that state some hours . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.51

Whilst I was at West's academy , he took a very fine , highly finished
drawing of me , in black and white chalks : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.52

I was then about eight years old : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.53

it is in the Guido style ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.54

and from this drawing the boys used to study . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.55

The late Mr. Francis West , son , and successor to his father in the
mastership of the academy , carefully preserved it ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.56

and it is still in being , as many of my friends had latterly told me
they had seen it . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.57

When my daughter was in Dublin in 1811 , <P_1,4> Mr. Francis West
showed it to her , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4.58

and was polite enough to promise her the first good copy that any of his
young pupils should make of it . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4.59

Another fine drawing , done by John Bryan , one of the students , made
me standing , leaning on the head of a Demosthenes , the port_crayon in
my hand ; a third of me , by Thomas Hickey , as sitting for a drawing
<paren> Hickey went draughtsman to China with Lord Macartney <$$paren> ;
and a fourth drawing , by Trotter , the centre of three heads ; myself
supposed to be singing , with Cartwright , one of the boys , playing the
flute on one side , and Mr. Manning , the master of the Ornament
Academy , <paren> who had studied in Paris <$$paren> playing the violin
on the other . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4.60

Mine is a front face , with the right hand appearing ; and the two
others profiles . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4.61

These three latter drawings , with others , were preserved with great
care in the Dublin Society Rooms , as specimens of the proficiency which
the students had made under old Mr. West's tuition ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4.62

and <P_1,5> indeed his drawing of what is technically called the Academy
Figure was unrivalled . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.63

In 1754 , when I was seven years of age , I saw Lord Trimlestown , at
his castle at Trimlestown , about four miles from Trim , the avenue
running down to the river Boyne . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.64

He had studied medicine abroad , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.65

and was a great botanist and physician , which his benevolence turned to
the use of rich and poor ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.66

the latter had medicine gratis , by his order , from his apothecary ,
Mr. Crawley , of Trim . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.67

Lord Trimlestown's , though a real castle , was full in use as a
comfortable mansion ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.68

he kept open house , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.69

but his guests did not see much of him . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.70

His eldest son was named Matthew , his second , Sir Thomas , being a
Knight of Malta . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.71

At Lord Trimlestown's was a fine aviary of Chinese pheasants , maccaws ,
&c. ; and a complete greenhouse , of the rarest exotics , all under his
own management . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.72

I remember seeing there , the aloe <paren> which only blossoms once in
a_hundred years <$$paren> in full bloom , and <P_1,6> a noble banana ,
the leaf five feet long and very wide . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.73

He had a superb coach , a present from Marshal Saxe , the fine paintings
on which , were boys in the Fiamingo Stile : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.74

to copy these , some of Mr. West's pupils , and others , came purposely
from Dublin . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.75

Lord Trimlestown was , in person , tall , large , and portly : -
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.76

he dressed in scarlet , full powdered wig , and black velvet hunting-cap
. OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.77

My father , who was some weeks his patient , took me with him to the
castle , where I met with the greatest kindness from both Lord and Lady
Trimlestown : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.78

they gave me a full ramble among their books , valuable pictures ,
portfolios of prints , rich cabinets , and splendid gardens .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.79

I was one day sitting alone , in a closet surrounded by gold and agate
snuffboxes , with miniature pictures in their lids , cameos , intaglios
, coins , medals , and abundance of every thing rich and rare , when he
came in , and found me attentively looking at the coats of arms , in a
little squab book , called , " The Irish <P_1,7> Compendium : "
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.80

he said nothing , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.81

but stood some time observing me , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.82

then , with a smile of goodnature , put his hand upon my head ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.83

and went out of the room . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.84

These shields and coats of arms gave me the first wish to an amusing
research in heraldry , a science which , though some may think it a kind
of frivolous foppery , often gives a useful clue to historical epoch ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.85

and my brother and I , when boys , had much pleasure from it , in
looking at the emblazonry on the coaches as they passed through the
streets - the coronets , helmets , degrees of nobility , &c. ; -
reminding each other of the old scroll of parchment in my father's
possession , so cracked and rumpled and rolled that it could scarcely be
opened ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.86

and , with a kind of anticipation , we , the future painter and poet ,
declared we would yet have the arms of the <font> Kings of Fermoy
<$$font> , the old crown and rampant supporters , on our own coaches and
landaus . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.87

At that time , I sung and drew prettily enough , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.88

and every night , at their supper table , <P_1,8> I was seated between
Lord and Lady Trimlestown , with my custard and my orange placed before
me . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.89

I saw also at that time Lord Gormanston , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.90

he was elderly , of the middle size , and always dressed in a full suit
of light blue . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.91

On my father's departure from Trimlestown , he and my mother and I went
to Knock-Drin , near Edenderry , where my father with pride , not
unmixed with dejection , led me over tracts of fine lands , once the
property of his ancestors : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.92

my mother had much the same remark to make of <font> her <$$font> family
losses in the county of Wexford . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.93

Bryan Kavanagh , my mother's <font> first <$$font> cousin , was the last
person of note who had any landed property left on that part of the
globe , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.94

and he did not remain long in Ireland , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.95

for having taken holy orders , he left his worldly affairs there in the
management of a lawyer in Henry Street , Dublin , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.96

and went to France OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.97

and settled at Bourdeaux , where he rose to be a dignitary of the Church
. OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.98

When he became possessed of rich and extensive lands , vineyards ,
<P_1,9> and tenements , he wrote over to my father and mother , to send
either my brother Daniel or me to him , with the offer to educate us for
any one of the three professions , the Church , the law , or the army ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.99

but unfortunately neither of us were ever sent . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.100

My only and elder brother , Dan O'Keeffe , <paren> afterwards an eminent
miniature painter <$$paren> was reserved by fate to flatter people on
ivory in England , and Jack O'Keeffe to make Hay for the Market , and
grow Flowers for the Garden . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.101

However , having the future advantage of my children in view , the said
catholic dignitary , Bryan Kavanagh , being my <font> second <$$font>
and their <font> third <$$font> cousin , I caused inquiries to be made
during the short peace in 1802 by a French gentleman , still living at
St. Quintin , concerning these French lands and possessions ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.102

he wrote to Bourdeaux for me , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.103

and made every exertion to that purpose , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.104

but never could learn what Robespierre or Buonaparte had <P_1,10> done
with them , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.105

and we are now contented and happy in the idea that they have been since
re-royalized in the persons of Louis the Eighteenth , and Charles the
Tenth , Kings of France : the buckles of the latter royal gentleman I
having popularized in 1779 , in these words of Bouquet's song in the "
Son-in-Law , " " My Artois buckles when you view In shining , sable ,
satin shoe . " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.106

To return to Trimlestown Castle . I remember a very fine live eagle
perched before the front door on the lawn , to whom the servants threw
pieces of meat within the length of his chain . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.107

One day , when I was standing watching the noble bird of Jove , an
unlucky dog , one of the hounds , attracted by the meat , ventured
within the limits of this eagle's iron tether : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.108

with furious rapidity , the eagle darted down , pouncing full upon the
dog's back with beak and talons . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.109

Some days after , the bird broke his chain OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.110

and soared into the skies ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.111

then dropped <P_1,11> into a field , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.112

seized a lamb , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.113

and carried it up into a high tree : - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.114

I forget whether either eagle or lamb were recovered .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.115

The only other person in Ireland that I recollect possessed with this
sublime fancy of retaining Jupiter's thunder-bearer to perch before his
door , was Mr. Brockhill Newburgh , who lived in Dublin , at
Glassmanogue . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.116

He was head of the Linen Board , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.117

and played very finely on the harpsichord . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.118

I have often been in company with him at the house of Mrs. Jefferies .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.119

John Hunter , the distinguished surgeon , brother to Dr. Hunter , who
lectured at the Royal Academy , Somerset-House , also had eagles perched
before his door at Earl's Court , near London , where I have frequently
stood to observe them . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.120

I think the latter eagles might consider themselves very well off to
escape dissection ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.121

for their owner dissected every thing that came in his way ; - the
kraken of the sea , the grasshopper in clover , and the lady-bird on her
<font> boghill-en-bwee . <$$font> OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.122

<P_1,12>

In 1756 , Hamilton <paren> afterwards eminent in the first class of
historical painters in England <$$paren> was my fellow-student in the R.
A. in Dublin : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.124

he might have been five years my elder ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.125

and was remarkable for choosing , when drawing the human figure , the
most foreshortened view , consequently the most difficult -
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.126

<paren> the finest specimen of foreshortening is that of King Charles's
Apotheosis in the ceiling of the chapel at Whitehall . <$$paren>
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.127

Our premiums were adjudged once a-year , in the House of Lords , Dublin
: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.128

the drawings of the candidates were pinned round the walls to be
examined as to their merits and classes . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.129

The boy wrote previously in chalk under his drawing " from the life , "
if it was so ; and " from the round , " if from a bust or statue .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.130

My brother Daniel , being one year one of the younger candidates , and
all full of their gambols , got to plucking off the large scarlet
tassels and bobbins from the benches , and pelting them at each other .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.131

One of these struck Hamilton's drawing , which being in chalks was
consequently <P_1,13> much injured . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.132

He , enraged , thinking that poor Dan had done the mischief , gave him a
most tremendous box on the ear . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.133

This accident , by the drawing being spoiled , lost Hamilton the premium
. OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.134

The names of those who obtained the premiums , and their different
classes , were in the newspapers : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.135

this was the proudest stimulus to our emulation .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.136

I obtained many premiums in the different classes , and once the head
premium for my drawing of the Ariadne , the well-known fine antique .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.137

We were early familiarized to the antique in sculpture , and in painting
, to the style and manner of the great Italian and French masters .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.138

We also studied anatomy ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.139

and , indeed , the students there turned their minds to most of the
sciences . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.140

We had upon the large table in the Academy , a figure three feet high ,
called the anatomy figure ; the skin off to show the muscles :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.141

on each muscle was a little paper with a figure of reference to a
description of it , and its uses . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.142

We had also a living figure , to stand or sit : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.143

he <P_1,14> was consequently a fine person ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.144

his pay was four shillings an hour . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.145

Mr. West himself always <font> posed <$$font> the figure , as the
phrase is , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.146

and the students took their views round the table where he was fixed .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.147

To make it certain that his attitude was the same each time we took our
study , Mr. West with a chalk marked upon the table the exact spot
where his foot , or his elbow or his hand came .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.148

We had a large round iron stove nearly in the centre of the school ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.149

but the fire was not seen ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.150

an iron tube conveyed the smoke through the wall .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.151

On the flat top of this stove , we used to lay our pencils of black and
white chalk to harden them . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.152

The room was very lofty : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.153

it had only three windows ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.154

they were high up in the wall , and so contrived as to make the light
descend : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.155

the centre window was arched , and near the top of the ceiling .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.156

At each end of this room was a row of presses with glass doors ; in
which were kept the statues cast from the real antique , each upon a
pedestal about two feet <P_1,15> high , and drawn out into the room as
they were wanted to be studied from : - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.157

but the busts were placed , when required , on the table .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.158

The stools we sat upon were square portable boxes , very strong and
solid , with a hole in the form of an S on each side to put in the hand
and move them . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.159

Each student had a mahogany drawing-board of his own :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.160

this was a square of three feet by four ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.161

at one end was a St. Andrew's cross , fastened with hinges , which
answered for a foot ; and on the other end of the board , a ledge to lay
our port_crayons upon . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.162

When we rose from our seats , we laid this board flat upon the ground ,
with the drawing we were then doing upon it . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.163

We had a clever civil little fellow for our porter , to run about and
buy our oranges and apples , and pencils , and crayons , and move our
busts and statues for us . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.164

He was a great favourite ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.165

and Mr. West used every day to say to him , " Master <font> Fling ,
<$$font> <paren> his real name was Flynn , <$$paren> bring me a seedy
<font> rowl , " <$$font> - and put a <P_1,16> halfpenny in his hand .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.166

We had some students who studied statuary alone ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.167

and they modelled in clay . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.168

Cunningham <paren> brother to the poet <$$paren> invented the small
basso-relievo portraits , in wax of the natural colours :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.169

they had oval frames , and convex crystal glasses
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.170

and were in great fashion . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.171

Berville , a most enthusiastic Frenchman , full of professional ardour ,
studied with us : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.172

and Van-Nost , the celebrated statuary , often came amongst us :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.173

he did the fine pedestrian statue of Lord Blakeney , erected in
Sackville-street . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.174

The members of the Dublin Society , composed of the Lord Lieutenant and
most of the nobility , and others , frequently visited our academy to
see our goings on : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.175

and some of the lads were occasionally sent to Rome , to study the
Italian masters . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.176

I was present , <paren> when about four years old , <$$paren>
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.177

and saw the cases containing the casts from the antique brought from
Rome , and opened ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.178

and from these in a very few years I studied . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.179

<P_1,17>

One day , passing through Parliament-street , Dublin , George Faulkner ,
the printer , was standing at his own shop-door ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.181

I was induced to stare in at a bust on the counter .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.182

He observed me , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.183

and by the portfolio under my arm , knew I was a pupil at the Royal
Academy . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.184

I remained in fixed attention , when he kindly invited me in to look at
the bust , saying it was the head of his friend and patron Dean Swift .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.185

To display it in all its different views , he turned it round and about
for me , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.186

and then brought me up stairs to see the picture of Swift .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.187

George Faulkner was a fat little man , with a large well-powdered wig ,
and brown clothes : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.188

his precision of speech in using the word <font> opposite <$$font>
instead of <font> facing <$$font> , was the cause of Swift choosing him
for his printer . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.189

At this period of my boyhood Swift's memory was recent ;

he was greatly beloved and revered in Dublin . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.191

There were many signs of him in canonicals : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.192

they were called the Drapier's Head , from the signature of his letters
against Wood's halfpence OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.193

<P_1,18>

I have one of those halfpence . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.195

Amongst a multitude of benevolent actions , he lent small sums to
tradespeople , to be repaid at a shilling a-week , five pounds the
greatest sum ; which practice laid the foundation of many a fortune
obtained by industry , and was the support of numerous families ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.196

but one neglect of the shilling a-week repayment , no more money was
lent by him to that person . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.197

Whenever the Dean walked out , the people followed him with shouts of
blessings , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.198

and the children held his cassock . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.199

My early passion for the drama made me like Swift , from his having been
a friend of Gay . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.200

The above house of George Faulkner was the corner of Parliament-street ,
and Essex-street , on the right hand . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.201

Mr. Dickson of Capel-street , brought paintings of birds and flowers
<paren> basso_relievo <$$paren> into great fashion :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.202

they were done in water-colours , upon large sheets of card-paper .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.203

Twelve made the set , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.204

and were painted for him by three <P_1,19> youths of considerable merit
: the eldest , James Riley ; Gustavus Hamilton , the son of a clergyman
; and my brother Daniel . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.205

They lived in Dickson's house , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.206

and had a table and every thing comfortable and respectable .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.207

My brother , the youngest of the three , had often a number of boys ,
his acquaintances , both in and out of the house after him , <paren> not
those of the academy , <$$paren> allured by getting now and then a
camel-hair pencil , or a bit of paint to colour their tops , and draw
stars and moons upon their kites . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.208

I often made one in this noisy string of intruders , being then about
six years of age . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.209

All this was really troublesome and disagreeable to the house in general
, but particularly to Mrs. Dickson's elder sister .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.210

One day , as many of us ran out of the street through the hall , and
rushed upstairs , all full intent to see <font> Daniel <$$font> O'Keeffe
, this old widow lady started in a violent passion out of the parlour ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.211

and exclaimed , - " Hey day ! what plaguy tribe is here ! "
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.212

- I happened to be the <P_1,20> last of the procession ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.213

and turning round said , " The tribe of <font> Dan . <$$font> "
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.214

On hearing such an answer from an urchin , her anger instantly changed
to a full fit of merriment : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.215

she clapped her hands to her sides , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.216

and there stood laughing full five minutes <font> sans <$$font>
intermission . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.217

This childish anecdote may be as well worth recording as that of Dr.
Johnson's " Good master Duck . " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.218

These three young lads who painted birds and flowers so admirably ,
turned out distinguished painters in miniature .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.219

Riley was enabled to have a fine house of his own in Grafton-street ,
Dublin ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.220

Hamilton was encouraged and patronized by ladies of the first rank there
, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.221

and made a power of money by his pencil ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.222

and my brother's field of action was London , where he died of
consumption at the age of 47 . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.223

He was tall and thin , very fair and delicately florid , blue eyes , his
hair light . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.224

His only daughter , Anne O'Keeffe , whom he had brought up with care and
tenderness at Boulogne <P_1,21> in France , also died of consumption ,
aged 28 . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.225

It is remarkable , that the above-mentioned house in Capel-street ,
inhabited by Dickson , was formerly the residence of Dr. Sheridan ,
father to Thomas Sheridan , the actor , and grandfather to Richard
Brinsley . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.226

The yard at the back , where I have often played at marbles , was the
play-ground of his scholars ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.227

and the school-room , wherein the boy made the impromptu of " The Rat
and the Bell-rope , and the Stairs , " was , at this time , Dickson's
coach-house . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.228

This very worthy , industrious , and truly useful member of society
<paren> Dickson <$$paren> first established <paren> at Leixlip <$$paren>
the beautiful and admired linen copperplate printing , which delineated
flowers in all their natural beauty . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.229

To my great sorrow , I heard long after that this laudable and patriotic
scheme was the ruin of his worldly affairs . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.230

It was , and perhaps is still , the Dublin custom on St. James's Day ,
for the relations and <P_1,22> friends of those buried in St. James's
church-yard , to dress up the graves with flowers , cut paper ,
Scripture phrases , garlands , chaplets , and a number of other pretty
and pious devices , where those affectionate mementos remained , until
displaced by fresh ones the next year . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.231

In this state , the whole church-yard made a most interesting and
pleasing appearance : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.232

every body went to see it ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.233

and I , when about nine years of age , went on St. James's Day .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.234

On my return home , full of the fine sight , I got my materials ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.235

and set to at drawing St. James's church-yard .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.236

Amongst tombstones in the foreground , I drew a very large one , with a
high flat stone at the head OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.237

and wrote on it , " Here lies the body of - . " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.238

As I had exhausted my stock of names on my other tombstones , I was
puzzled for a name for this : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.239

at that moment , a man happened to come into the room , with a pair of
new shoes for my father : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.240

he was of the county of Wexford , a very good shoemaker , and a very
honest fellow - in health and person remarkably <P_1,23> well-looking ;
strong , tall , and athletic . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.241

His name being Paddy Furlong , I , most <font> apropos <$$font> , wrote
upon my tombstone " Patrick Furlong . " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.242

He had been looking over my shoulder , and admiring the drawing ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.243

but , when he saw me add his own name , seemed a little startled .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.244

With the thoughtlessness of childhood , I went on writing " Who died on
the - " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.245

here I was at another stand ; when the Wexford shoemaker said to me - "
On the Second of September , - put down that . " -
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.246

I did so . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.247

- " One_thousand_seven_hundred_and_fifty-six : put down that . "
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.248

I complied , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.249

and away he went . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.250

About a week after , we heard he was ill , and dangerously so ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.251

and in a few weeks more , we were told that he had died on the 2d of
September , the very day he himself had desired me to write on the
tombstone . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.252

Amongst a few unlucky drawing exploits of mine when a boy , one day
calling with my brother at a house in Henry-street , where he had some
business , I rambled into the dining-parlour , <P_1,24> in which the
table had been laid out by the butler and other servants , all in form ;
company of the first order having been invited that day .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.253

On observing the fine expanded damask tablecloth , " Ha ! " thought I ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.254

" no sheet of paper is so large as this ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.255

the very thing I@ @'ve long been wishing for . "
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.256

Seeing an inkstand on the sideboard , I took it ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.257

placed it on the table , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.258

and , inspired by my subject , which was a fine deer hunt , I drew with
pen and ink a stag , at full speed , with head and horns erect ; and
then a full pack of hounds in the regular order of pursuit ; and after
them the huntsman on his horse , winding his horn , followed up by a
number of hunting squires , all on horseback , as I myself had often
seen them near Dunleary , and Bray , and Laughlin's Town , with Johnny
Adair of Kilternan at their head . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.259

This pen and ink performance of mine stretched the whole length of the
table , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.260

and I brought forward a chair , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.261

and stood upon it , that I might look down upon my work with the
greatest advantages of delight , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.262

<P_1,25>

but to my confusion I soon heard with many bitter remarks , that I had
spoiled the rich fine valuable table cloth . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.264

I was about nine years of age , when having one day to go down
Dame-street , I joined company at the top , near College Green , with my
fellow-student whom I have mentioned before , Johnny Bryan , who was
going the same way . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.265

He was at this time my senior , and much taller and older than me ;
indeed , of the first rank as a proficient in drawing ; of a placid ,
mild character , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.266

and I liked him much . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.267

We walked on , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.268

and kept in conversation until we reached within a few yards of Crampton
Court , at the lower end of Dame-street , I being outside , and he on my
right hand . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.269

Now and then , as we talked , I looked up in his face :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.270

by degrees , I thought I saw some change in the features , which
surprised me - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.271

yet still we walked on , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.272

and kept up the conversation . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.273

At length , looking up anxiously at his face , the change came full upon
me , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.274

and I felt a tremor and alarm through <P_1,26> my whole frame that I
could not account for . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.275

I looked more stedfastly , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.276

and observed some traits in the face that I had never seen before .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.277

Still we continued our way , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.278

and kept talking to each other : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.279

but now , though the street was full of people passing and repassing ,
<paren> it being at that time the greatest thoroughfare in Dublin ,
<$$paren> I was seized with perfect terror , as seeming spellbound to
the figure that was walking at my side . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.280

I once more looked up , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.281

and was unable to repress my horror and dismay , when he stopped and
smiled , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.282

and in a kind voice , looking down upon me , said " You think you are
speaking to my brother Johnny , your schoolfellow . "
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.283

I found afterwards that it was very common to mistake these brothers for
each other , they were so like in person , and dressed alike .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.284

I had never before seen the elder brother , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.285

and to this day can@ @not forget the shock I felt at this adventure .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.286

The river Liffey , above Island Bridge , was <P_1,27> divided into two
streams , the broad wiers , and the narrow wiers .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.287

The Dublin boys were much in the habit of going there to swim .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.288

One day , a schoolfellow of mine , Robert Healy , and I <paren> we were
both about ten years of age <$$paren> went up there on our rambles .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.289

We were swimming in that part of the river above where it divides ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.290

and , by our carelessness , were drawn by the current into the narrow
wiers : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.291

the stream was rapid , smooth and black from its depth , and nearly
inaccessible on both sides . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.292

Though we were both excellent swimmers , yet our skill had no more
effect than to keep us on the surface of the water .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.293

Turn about , or change the direction in which we were forced on by the
current , we could not . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.294

However , Healy , with his right hand , caught hold of some overhanging
bushes , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.295

and drew himself in from the power of the current .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.296

At that instant , the force of the water was hurrying me on rapidly -
when he stretched out his left hand , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.297

and , at the instant I was passing him , caught me by the <P_1,28> hair
, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.298

and drew me by degrees towards himself . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.299

At this moment , I was within ten yards of a wide arch , that opened
under the mill , and into which , but for this wonderful interposition
of Providence , I must inevitably have been hurried , and mangled and
torn by the wheels and machinery inside . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.300

This mill stood on the south side of Island Bridge ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.301

and at the corner a lane runs from it up to John's Well .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.302

Healy went to West's at the same time with me , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.303

and by his ability arrived at the highest point of his profession ;
drawing in chalks , portraits , &c. : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.304

but his chief forte was horses , which he delineated so admirably , that
he got plenty of employment from those who had favourite hunters ,
racers , or ladies' palfreys . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.305

He was a kind and good-natured boy , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.306

and I had a great friendship for him . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.307

On the site where Crow-street Theatre was built , once stood a fabric ,
called the Music Hall . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.308

I recollect seeing this building : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.309

the front , with great gates , faced the end of Crow-street :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.310

<P_1,29>

and here Handel had his sublime oratorios performed , he in person
presiding . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.312

I well remember seeing the bill of Handel's concert on the gate of this
hall , in 1758 . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.313

This circumstance was many years previous to his even composing his
beautiful " Water Music , " and having it played in the barge , to the
surprise and delight of George the Second ; which noble device replaced
him in the full favour of his royal master . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.314

His talents , so cherished in Dublin , made me exult in seeing him in
his exalted niche , and marble organ , in Westminster Abbey , when I
went first to London . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.315

Whilst the foundations of Crow-street Theatre were preparing on this
spot , I , amongst other boys , <paren> Remus-like <$$paren> got jumping
over them , little thinking that on the very stage then erecting would ,
in process of time , rise my own fabric of " The Castle of Andalusia .
" OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.316

Crow-street opened with Cibber's comedy of " She would , and she would
not . " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.317

A man was pressed to death the first night , going up the <P_1,30> upper
gallery stairs : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.318

some ill fate seems to hang upon this play . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.319

One of the new managers , Woodward , was the Trappanti of that night .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.320

In my boyhood , I often heard the famous singers of sacred music ;
Colloghan , in the choir of St. Patrick's Cathedral , and Father Neale
, of the Catholic Chapel . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.321

They were both very fat : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.322

Colloghan's voice was a noble bass , and Neale's a fine treble , with a
falsetto , which he managed with great effect . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.323

In 1755 the celebrated Mrs. Woffington acted , in the first play I ever
saw , Alicia , in " Jane Shore . " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.324

I remember , some years after , seeing her mother , whom she comfortably
supported ; a respectable-looking old lady , in her short black velvet
cloak , with deep rich fringe , a diamond ring , and small agate
snuffbox . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.325

She had nothing to mind but going the rounds of the Catholic chapels and
chatting with her neighbours . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.326

Mrs. Woffington , the actress , built and endowed a number of
alms-houses <P_1,31> at Teddington , Middlesex , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.327

and there they are to this day . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.328

She is buried in the church ; her name on her tomb-stone .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.329

Dr. Baldwin , the provost of Dublin College , was a meagre old man :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.330

I saw him when dead lie in state . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.331

His successor , Dr. Andrews , was a fine , jolly , fresh looking man ,
very fond of the theatre , and a member of the Beef-steak Club , at
which Mrs. Woffington presided . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.332

The Duke of Dorset was then Lord Lieutenant . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.333

Lord George Sackville <paren> afterwards Lord George Germaine <$$paren>
was the soul of the party ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.334

and , though an actress headed the table , politics was the favourite
dish , for which Thomas Sheridan <paren> the elder <$$paren> had his old
house pulled over his ears - " Mahomet {COM:reference_to_mahomet_riots}
" for that ! OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.335

On the first and great successful run of Gay's " Beggar's Opera , " in
London , his friend Swift with his powerful pen raised its character
very high in Dublin , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.336

and in a booth erected in George's Lane , the opera was performed by
<P_1,32> children : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.337

little Peggy Woffington , in Polly , made her first appearance on any
stage . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.338

In my childhood , the finest collection of pictures in Ireland were
those of Mr. Stewart , <paren> afterwards Lord Londonderry , <$$paren>
in Henry Street , of Major Whitelock , and of the Bishop of Clogher .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.339

At Mr. Stewart's I saw the Veronica of <paren> I think <$$paren> Gerard
Dow , the finest picture I had ever seen ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.340

the subject is well known : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.341

it is a full front face of our blessed Saviour , without any shadow :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.342

it seemed to me a miraculous excellence in the art of the painter .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.343

Dr. Padmore , in Britain-street , had a capital collection of pictures
: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.344

he was a real virtuoso , a little man , with sallow round face , tie_wig
, black clothes , and scarlet stockings : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.345

when I was about eight years old , I used to go to his house , and draw
from his pictures . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.346

I remember Captain Debrisay , who , upwards of seventy years of age ,
walked the streets of Dublin unremarked , in the old dress , worn in the
days of Charles the Second ; a large cocked <P_1,33> hat , all on one
side his face , nearly covering his left eye ; a great powdered wig ,
hanging at the side in curls , and in the centre at the back a large
black cockade , with a small drop curl from it ; his embroidered
waistcoat down to his knees ; the top of his coat not within three
inches of his neck , the hip buttons about a foot from it ; buttons all
the way down the coat , but only one at the waist buttoned ; the hilt of
the sword through the opening of the skirt ; a long cravat , fringed ,
the end pulled through the third button-hole ; small buckles ; the coat
sleeves very short , and the shirt sleeves pulled down , but hid by the
top of the gloves , and the ruffles hanging out at the opening of the
cuff ; the waistcoat entirely open except the lower button , displaying
the finely plaited frill . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,33.347

Captain Debrisay's two sons were in the artillery , and great Castle
people : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,33.348

many years after , I often saw them and Miss Debrisay on the command
nights at the theatre . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,33.349

Over his <P_1,34> hall door , in the street , was a fine statue of Mars
. OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.350

In my boyhood a very tragic circumstance happened at the house of this
Captain Debrisay . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.351

There were new steps and an arched landing put to the street-door ,
under which was an area : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.352

the servant maid was washing plates or something of that sort under
these steps , when the mortar gave way , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.353

the arch and steps fell , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.354

and she was crushed to death . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.355

A poor man who sold cakes , which he called by the Dublin names , and
had in panniers on each side a little ass , had a custom every day of
crying out when passing Captain Debrisay's house , " Here@ @'s a fine
<font> pyclet <$$font> for Mary ! <paren> Pyclet is the London muffin ;
crumpets are not known there ; <$$paren> and some nice <font> galbonians
<$$font> for Mary ! and some fine French faddles for Mary !
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.356

where are you , Mary ? OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.357

where are you now , Mary ? OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.358

where are you now , Mary , Mary , Mary ? " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.359

In this full cry he was coming down the street , and approaching the
house when the <P_1,35> accident happened , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.360

and just as he vociferated " Mary ! Mary ! where are you <font> now ,
<$$font> Mary ? " he saw the crowd , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.361

<paren> I was in it , <$$paren> OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.362

and heard the fate of the poor girl . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.363

The awful sound to the sympathizing people was " Where are you <font>
now , <$$font> Mary , Mary , Mary ? " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.364

The builder was on the spot ; his face and manner most appalling .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.365

In 1760 , being thirteen years of age , my choice seat was up in a tree
near my aunt Byrne@ @'s house in Dorset-street , almost opposite this
Captain Debrisay's . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.366

One day , perched up there <paren> like Charles II. in his oak
<$$paren> , I saw pass under me the Artillery going to the North to
oppose Thurot , when he landed at Carrickfergus .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.367

The people of Dublin seemed easy enough about it .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.368

Some years after , when I was at Belfast , and took drawings of that
town for Lord Donnegal , I also took a view of Carrickfergus , from a
distance of about three miles ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.369

and , though a four-wheeled carriage of Lord Donnegal's , and his
servants in liveries attended me , yet such were the apprehensions and
terrors <P_1,36> that Thurot's descent left upon the Carrickfergus
people , that the mayor sent some of his officers on horseback to post
off towards me , and make a strict inquiry what I was about by taking
drawings of the town , the bay , and the castle .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.370

Certainly my dress and manner had somewhat of a Frenchified appearance ,
with my hair fully powdered , a little rose-bag and small gold-laced
cocked hat . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.371

An incident in R. B. Sheridan's " Camp , " was so very like this
circumstance , that most probably he had previously heard of it .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.372

In his piece Moody was the Irish artist who is drawing , and in a very
good equivoque taken into custody for it by the soldier .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.373

I mentioned my own affair at the time to Lord Donnegal and many others .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.374

In the year 1760 , when Thurot actually had possession of the Castle ,
Mr. Tottenham Heaphy , afterwards my father-in-law , was at supper with
others at Gilmer's tavern , opposite Crow-street Theatre , Dublin ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.375

and hearing of it , he ran to the stable where his horse was ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.376

mounted , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.377

<P_1,37>

and set off full speed towards the North . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.379

When he had gone about twenty miles or so , he met a courier posting
with intelligence for the Lord Lieutenant at the Castle of Dublin .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.380

Mr. Heaphy remarking that his horse was a poor sort of jade , and
incompetent to the haste the emergency of the business required , made
him mount his own horse , a very capital one , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.381

and took the tired hack of the messenger . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.382

He never saw his horse again ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.383

however , the affair was very well known , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.384

and did Mr. Heaphy and his family no harm . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.385

In my boyhood and youth I often saw the grand triennial sight called the
Franchises . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,38.417

The first view of it made a great impression on my mind :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,38.418

I was seated in the front window of my cousin Kavanagh@ @'s house in
Thomas-street , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,38.419

and saw the procession pass close under me . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,38.420

It consisted of the riding and walking of the trades of Dublin <paren>
there called Corporations <$$paren> . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,38.421

<P_1,39>

The whole were first assembled and marshalled in the great square of
Stephen's Green , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.423

and from thence in order commenced their perambulations of the city .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.424

Many of the trades were remarkable for the splendour of their pageants ,
as most persons of rank who had handsome equipages and fine horses and
trappings lent them for this day's cavalcade . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.425

The printers had a large splendid open carriage , in which was a
printing press , the compositors setting types , and the men working off
impressions , which , as fast as they printed , they flung to the
populace in the streets : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.426

this was a description of the whole procession , masters , wardens ,
colours , &c. , and a <font> finely-@ @written <$$font> explanatory
poem . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.427

The smiths had a grand high phaeton , in which sat the most beautiful
young girl that could be found , as Venus ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.428

at the corners were Cupids and Loves and the Graces , and so forth ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.429

and Vulcan in armour rode by her side . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.430

The carriage of the weavers was also very handsome :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.431

the men wore large <P_1,40> wigs of wool of different colours .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.432

The millers and bakers had men dressed up in wheat sheaves . The masons
and carpenters , all the emblems of masonry , with Solomon's Temple ,
&c. OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.433

The curriers were represented by men appareled in skins , with large
grotesque masks , and great wooden falchions , which they flourished
about . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.434

The chandlers were remarkably {TEXT:remakably} fine for horses , dress ,
and accoutrements : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.435

their insignia was a dove , and their motto " Let your light so shine .
" OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.436

The hosiers had in their carriage the stocking-loom , and a man really
weaving stockings , and at the corners of the carriage young women at
their wheels , spinning silk , flax , and cotton .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.437

The goldsmiths , glass-makers , jewellers , carvers and gilders , had
each their sumptuous pageant expressive of their trade .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.438

The linen weavers had in their vehicle a loom , at which they were
employed in weaving as they rode along : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.439

young women were spinning , and a youth dressed as a collegian , <font>
en badinage <$$font> , breaking their threads , &c.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.440

The <P_1,4l> shoemakers displayed a prince and princess , - Crispin and
Crispiana , - dressed in gold and silver robes , and crowns , with two
little pages carrying between them a crimson velvet cushion , and on it
a gold slipper . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.441

The vintners had Bacchus , dressed in ivy and vine leaves , astride upon
a tun , with a bowl of wine in his two hands , drinking to the health of
the people ; and a number of bacchanals , Silenus , fauns , and satyrs ,
following him . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.442

The upholsterers were headed by a man dressed all in feathers :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.443

he was called the Featherman , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.444

and , from his arch gambols and comic attitudes , was the great delight
of the crowd . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.445

It became a saying to anything of high humour , " Oh , this beats the
Feather-man ! " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.446

The Guild , or corporation of merchants , were all in uniform ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.447

and rode remarkably fine horses of their own . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.448

Each trade had a band of music , and its own appropriate tune ; so that
as one party was passing by you , the particular air was heard at a
distance , proclaiming the approach of the next .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.449

The whole cavalcade <P_1,42> and procession consisted of many thousand
persons , all arranged with strict decorum in their proper places .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.450

Each corporation had its masters , wardens , and beadles , dressed and
equipped in full paraphernalia . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.451

The Lord Mayor , Aldermen , &c. made part of the show .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.452

When they reached the end of the North Wall , the Lord Mayor and his
attendants got into a barge , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.453

and were rowed out into the bay , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.454

and at a particular station , he stood up , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.455

and with all his force threw a dart from him into the sea , as far as he
could : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.456

where the dart fell , a buoy was fixed , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.457

and as far as that , his warrant , as Lord Mayor of the city , reached ,
extending to every vessel within that buoy . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.458

In what is called the Earl of Meath@ @'s Liberty , the Lord Mayor of
Dublin has no jurisdiction , this quarter of the town having a court of
its own . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.459

This Liberty consists of some of the largest , finest , and richest
streets in Dublin ; for instance , Meath-street , Francis-street , and
the <P_1,43> Coombie . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.460

In the latter was the Weavers' Hall : over the gate a pedestrian gilt
statue , as large as life , of George the Second .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.461

The Lord Mayor walked the boundaries , his sword-bearer before him ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.462

but when arrived at the point where the Liberty begins , he was met by a
certain chosen number of people , who stopped his progress , and in a
kind of seeming scuffle took the sword from the sword-bearer :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.463

if not thus prevented , and the Lord Mayor permitted to go on , wherever
he went , with his sword of office borne before him , the power of his
warrant would reach ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.464

but this ceremony is done without the least riot or ill-will , being
part of the business previously well prepared . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.465

All this affair took place in one day , the first of August , every
third year . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.466

To this grand triennial festival people flocked to Dublin from all parts
of Ireland , England , Scotland , and even from the Continent :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.467

it was always looked to with great joy . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.468

The Regatta at Venice was something in this way .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.469

Many <P_1,44> years after I wrote a piece , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.470

and had it brought out at Crow-street , for the express purpose of
introducing the procession , and beautiful pageantry of our Dublin
franchises . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.471

I knew Counseller Leonard Mac Nally , when a boy .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.472

His uncle was an eminent merchant in Dublin , of the name of
Featherstone , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.473

and lived in Mary's-lane ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.474

he had another uncle , Arthur Murphy , <paren> not the poet <$$paren> .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.475

Mrs. Mac Nally , his mother , was one of the finest persons of a woman
I ever saw ; tall , full , and majestic . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.476

Leonard himself was much under_size , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.477

but had a handsome , expressive countenance , and fine sparkling dark
eyes {TEXT:eye} : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.478

he was a sprightly boy ; and such his passion for private plays , that
he was indulged in having a little theatre fitted up in his mother's
house , which all the boys of his turn frequented , - I one of them .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.479

Many years after , Mac Nally was editor of the Ledger , a London
newspaper , and very indulgent to my pieces as they appeared .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.480

His own opera of " Robin Hood , " had great success :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.481

his uncle , <P_1,45> Arthur Murphy , coming to London , Mac Nally
brought him to Covent-garden Theatre to see it ; when , to the surprise
of the author , and the vexation of both , the opera was that night
performed as an afterpiece , having been , without his knowledge , cut
down into two acts : such the mortifications of even a successful
dramatic poet . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.482

He also wrote a comedy , " Fashionable Levities , " and a farce , "
Retaliation , " both very successful . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.483

Tired with literary fagging , Mac Nally went back to Dublin ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.484

and pursued his profession as a barrister . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.485

I was told he excelled all his contemporaries in keen and sarcastic wit
, - a most effective legal weapon in defence of a client .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.486

Counsellor and Mrs. Costello were great supporters of the drama in
Mossop's time . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.487

He was a distinguished pleader , and remarkable for his brogue , which
many of the most eminent men at the Irish bar affected :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.488

it made them favourites , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.489

and sent their sarcasms with more force in irony .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.490

A poor country fellow came <P_1,46> one day to surrender himself to take
his trial on a capital charge . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.491

Drawing Costello aside , he gave him a guinea as a fee ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.492

and asked his advice . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.493

The counsellor desired him to tell him frankly his case , without any
concealment . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.494

He did so . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.495

Having patiently listened to it , " My good fellow , " said Costello ,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.496

" you see that staircase : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.497

my opinion and advice is , that you walk down instantly into the street
, turn the corner on the right hand , make the best of your way to the
quay , get into the first ship you can find ready to sail , and never
again be found in Ireland , England , or Scotland ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.498

- and here , take back the guinea you gave me for my advice , towards
travelling charges . " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.499

Costello saw that the unfortunate man , though not culpable , from some
particular points of law , which he fore-knew would come out upon the
trial , must have suffered . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.500

What is called barrister in England , is called counsellor in Ireland :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.501

the word barrister is not known there . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.502

When I was a child , I saw the famous Sir Toby Butler , a favourite
lawyer of his time , <P_1,47> his powers of oratory being great ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.503

but he always drank his bottle before he went to the courts .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.504

A client , very solicitous about the success of his cause , requested
Sir Toby not to drink his accustomed bottle that morning .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.505

Sir Toby promised on his honour he would not . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.506

He went to the court , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.507

pleaded , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.508

and gained a verdict . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.509

The client met him exulting in the success of his advice ; when , to his
astonishment , Sir Toby assured him that if he had <font> not <$$font>
taken his bottle , he should have lost the cause .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.510

" But your promise , Sir Toby ? " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.511

- " I kept it faithfully and honourably , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.512

I did not <font> drink <$$font> a drop - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.513

I poured my bottle of claret into a wheaten loaf OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.514

and <font> ate <$$font> it . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.515

So I had my bottle , you your verdict , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.516

and I am a man of my word . " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.517

Sir Toby Butler is buried in St. James's Church-yard , Dublin , not far
from the entrance ; an iron rail round the tomb , and a stone figure of
himself in wig and gown , lying all along on the top of it .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.518

Near this tombstone , my father , John O'Keeffe , was buried , in the
year 1758 . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.519

<P_1,48>

About the year 1759 , Mrs. Abingdon was in great celebrity in Dublin ,
the leader of fashion , and favourite of the ladies of the highest rank
, who consulted her taste and fancy in their dresses , &c. ; and in
London , plagued her much on masquerade nights ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.521

- the Abingdon cap I remember all the rage : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.522

her manner was most charmingly fascinating , and her speaking voice
melodious . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.523

She had peculiar tricks in acting ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.524

one was turning her wrist , and seeming to stick a pin in the side of
her waist : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.525

she was also very adroit in the exercise of her fan ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.526

and , though equally capital in fine ladies and hoydens , was never seen
in low or vulgar characters . OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.527

On her benefit night , the pit was always railed into the boxes .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.528

Her acting shone brightest when doing Estifania , with Brown's Copper
Captain : OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.529

their comic excellence was a rich dramatic feast .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.530

Her maiden name was Barton - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.531

her husband , a neat little gentlemanly figure , belonged to the band .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.532

Mrs. Abingdon's prudent custom , when in London , was to adapt her
residence <P_1,49> to her means for the time ; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,49.533

when she was in the full swing of money , she had a fine house in
Piccadilly , opposite the Green Park , OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,49.534

and when not so rich in purse was content with humbler dwellings .
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,49.535
