<font> Evidence for the Crown . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.3

Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font> , of the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , was
called into Court and sworn . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.4

<font> Captain <$$font> Taylor , <font> the Captain of the <$$font>
Cornwal . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.5

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Did not Captain <font> Holmes <$$font>
in the <font> Lenox <$$font> , during the Action with the <font> Spanish
<$$font> Squadron , run upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Weather-Quarter , and lie along Side there for the Space of half an Hour
, so as she could scarce fire any Guns but a few of the aftermost ,
clear of her , and these not without great Danger of firing into her ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.6

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I was upon the Weather-Quarter ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.7

and the Admiral sent for me from the lower Gun-Deck , on purpose to hail
her , to take Care she did not fire thro' us , and bid her fall a Stern
into her Station . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.8

<font> Court . <$$font> How long did she lie there ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.9

<font> A. <$$font> About half an Hour , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.10

when we left off firing she was to Leeward of us .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.11

<font> Q. <$$font> Was she so near as to answer your Hail ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.12

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , she answered ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.13

but I did not hear what she said . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.14

Her Courses were up and Main-topsails {TEXT:Mains-topsail} aback , to
the best of my Knowledge , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,2.15

and better than half an Hour after that , we left off firing of our
Starboard Side to let her pass to <P_3> Leeward , the Enemy being at
that Time almost out of Gun-Shot . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.16

<font> Q. <$$font> Had you then lost the Head of your Maintop-Mast when
you came upon Deck ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.17

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.18

<font> Q. <$$font> How long after was it before you lost it ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.19

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't say what Time : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.20

I was sent after upon the lower Gun-Deck upon its being carried away .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.21

Adm. <font> Knowles <$$font> answers , <font> About half an Hour .
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.22

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> When Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font> first
came up was the <font> Lenox's <$$font> Foretopsail aback , Foresail up
, and Yard {TEXT:"ard"_preceded_by_"Y"-sized_space} Square , and
attempting to get a Stern ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.23

<font> A. <$$font> The Foresail up , and Main-Yard Square ,
Mizentopsail aback , and Foreyard braced up , to the best of my
Knowledge , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.24

but know no more . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.25

<font> Q. <$$font> What Sail was the <font> Cornwal <$$font> under at
that Time ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.26

<font> A. <$$font> The Foresail set , Foretopsail-Yard upon the Cap ,
the Maintopsail , to the best of my Knowledge was to the Slings , partly
up , or thereabouts , I believe , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.27

but can@ @not be quite positive . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.28

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> During the Time the <font> Lenox
<$$font> lay upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter , did
not the Enemy's Sternmost Ships shoot up to cover their Admiral , and
keep firing upon the <font> Cornwal ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.29

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , they did ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.30

and the Men called out , what is there nobody to second us ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.31

and the Admiral directed me to chear the Men up , and behave bravely ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.32

and we would beat them ourselves . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.33

<font> Court . <$$font> Where was the <font> Lenox <$$font> at that
Time ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.34

<font> A. <$$font> Upon our Quarter . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.35

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Did not the Enemies Sternmost Ships
after this Time shoot away the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Maintopmast ,
and disable her so in her Rigging , that she could not pursue the Enemy
afterwards , when they ran ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,3.36

<font> A. <$$font> I was upon the lower Gun-Deck , at the <P_4> Time
when our Maintopmast was shot away , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.37

but we were greatly disabled in our Rigging , and I think so near at
that Time to the <font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral , when they came to
acquaint me our Maintopmast was gone , that it was not possible for the
Ships abreast of us to shoot it away : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.38

I think it must have been carried away by the Sternmost Ships .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.39

<font> Q. <$$font> Could the Enemy's Sternmost Ships have done so , if
the <font> Lenox <$$font> had kept her proper Station , a Stern of the
<font> Cornwal <$$font> , and engaged the Enemy in a Line of Battle as
she ought to have done ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.40

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Lenox <$$font> would have kept a great
Part of the Fire from us , without Doubt , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.41

it might have been a Means of saving her Maintopmast ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.42

but can@ @not give a positive Answer . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.43

<font> Q. <$$font> Did she obey these Orders till the Enemy were put to
Flight ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.44

<font> A. <$$font> I saw the <font> Lenox's <$$font> Maintopsail aback
, HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.45

but am not certain whether after I hailed , or before .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.46

<font> Q. <$$font> When you hailed the <font> Lenox <$$font> , did she
obey the Orders by falling into her Station a-Stern of the <font>
Cornwal ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.47

<font> A. <$$font> I could not see , being running backwards and
forwards upon different Decks , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.48

but from the Time of my first seeing her to Windward , till she passed
to Leeward , was half an Hour . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.49

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> If it was half an Hour before I passed , do
not you imagine I was engaged when I passed the <font> Cornwal ?
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.50

<font> A. <$$font> You might , but not to my Knowledge :
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.51

I did not see it . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.52

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not the <font> Cornwal <$$font> fire several
Broadsides at the Enemy after the <font> Lenox <$$font> passed to
Leeward ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.53

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not immediately recollect ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.54

for I have already declared she was almost out of Gun-Shot .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,4.55

<P_5>

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> After the Enemy were running did not
Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> wear under the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Stern , run close up to Leeward of her , spring his Luff , hawll out his
Mizen , and stretch off upon her Weather-Bow ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.57

<font> A. <$$font> I saw her pass to Leeward of us ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.58

and we lost sight of her ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.59

I was looking out of the Port , which must be from her springing her
Luff . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.60

<font> Q. <$$font> After the Signal was made for Chasing to Leeward ,
did Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> obey it , till I was obliged to send
you on Board with Orders to pursue the Enemy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.61

<font> A. <$$font> No , he did not . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.62

<font> Q. <$$font> Soon after you had given my Orders to Capt. <font>
Holmes <$$font> , and he had bore away for a little while , did he not
hawll out his Mizen , and keep his Luff again ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.63

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , he did . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.64

<font> Q. <$$font> Did the <font> Lenox <$$font> make all the Sail she
could to get up with the Enemy , after you had delivered these Orders ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.65

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.66

<font> Q. <$$font> Might not Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> , if he had
bore down directly when the general Signal was made to chase to Leeward
, have come to as close Engagement with the Enemy's Ships as the <font>
Strafford <$$font> did ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.67

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't know any thing could have prevented it ,
had he made all the Sail he could , agreeable to the Admiral's Direction
to come to close Engagement . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.68

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> What Sail had I abroad ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.69

and what Sail could I have set ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.70

<font> A. <$$font> When I went along Side of the <font> Lenox <$$font>
her Topsail and Foresail , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.71

and can@ @not be positive whether the Staysails or not ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,5.72

and upon my delivering the Message for coming to a close Engagement soon
after , to the best of my Knowledge , <P_6> he set his Topgallant-Sails
; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.73

that@ @'s the Sail he had set : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.74

As the Wind was upon the Beam , or thereabouts , he might have set his
Mainsail and Studdingsails . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.75

<font> Court . <$$font> How was the Enemy bearing of him when you went
aboard of him ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.76

<font> A. <$$font> Not quite a Breast ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.77

the Center Ships were before the Beam . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.78

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did the Enemy go before Wind , or how ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.79

<font> A. <$$font> I take it the Wind was rather abaft the Beam , or
thereabouts , from a quarter after five : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.80

I did not near your Distance till the Day closed ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.81

I was in the Boat going from Ship to Ship . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.82

<font> Q. <$$font> How long did you see me ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.83

<font> A. <$$font> From a quarter after five .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.84

<font> Court . <$$font> When you went aboard what Orders did you give
him ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.85

<font> A. <$$font> The Admiral's Orders were to make the most Dispatch
I could to Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> , and to tell him he was
greatly surprised he should lie at that Distance , and fire his Shot in
waste , or Words to that Effect ; that he would have him make Sail , and
bear down , and come to close Action with the Enemy , or else he would
send another Captain on Board his Ship : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.86

But as I was in a Boat , I did not deliver the last Part . Upon which
Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> asked me if I did not think he had behaved
very well . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.87

I told him for Answer , that he knew best , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.88

and desired that he would come to closer Action with the Enemy ,
according to the Admiral's Orders . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.89

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the Ship engaged at that Time you were along
Side of her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.90

<font> A. <$$font> She fired three or four Guns every now and then .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.91

<font> Q. <$$font> Did they fire at the <font> Lenox <$$font> at that
Time , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.92

and did you see any of their Shot fall , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.93

and where ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,6.94

<P_7>

<font> A. <$$font> I saw some Shot fired at the <font> Lenox <$$font> ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.96

and the Shot passed by the Boat beyond the <font> Lenox <$$font> when I
was near her , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.97

but could not observe Shot reach them . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.98

<font> Q. <$$font> As Captain <font> Taylor <$$font> had Orders from
the Admiral to rebuke Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> in so severe a
manner , and that he did not deliver his Admiral's Orders , tho' they
were in a manner extorted from him by Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> ,
the Question is , whether or not , that did not shew his Approbation of
Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> 's Conduct , since it did not appear that
he thought Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> deserved such a Reprimand ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.99

<font> A. <$$font> That I did think he deserved ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.100

and shall always think so ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.101

but my Reason for not delivering it was to prevent the Ships Company
from hearing it , as I was along Side , and did not go into the Ship .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.102

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> How far was the <font> Tilbury <$$font>
a-Head , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.103

and had you not Orders to go to the <font> Tilbury <$$font> at that Time
you went from me ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.104

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Tilbury <$$font> must be , I believe , a
Mile and a half , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.105

but can@ @not be sure of the Distance , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.106

but I was back again by Night , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.107

and had Orders to go to her when I went from the <font> Lenox .
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.108

Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> repeated the Question before concerning
the Admiral's Orders . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.109

<font> A. <$$font> Upon which he loosed his Topgallant-Sails , hauled
the Weather Brace of his Main-yard , and about two or three Minutes
sprung his Luff , and hauled his Mizen out , and kept shivering his
Maintopsail for eight or ten Minutes , before I observed it to be full
again , which I took Notice of to the Midshipmen and Cockswain , and
told them I thought he was infatuated . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.110

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the <font> Warwick <$$font> at the Time
I sprung my Luff , and shortly after you delivered the Admiral's Orders
to me ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,7.111

<P_8>

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Warwick <$$font> was not near him at this
Time , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,8.113

but coming back again when I had been on board the <font> Tilbury
<$$font> , I called upon the <font> Warwick . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,8.114

<font> Q. <$$font> Can Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font> tell what
Condition the <font> Lenox <$$font> was in when he called along Side of
her ; whether her Maintopsail-Yard was Shot in two , or her
Foretopsail-Yard Shot through ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,8.115

<font> A. <$$font> Not any thing visible to me ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,8.116

they might be wounded , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,8.117

but were not hanging down , nor carried away .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,8.118

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> When the <font> Lenox <$$font> joined
the Squadron the Day after the Action , did you see her any wise
disabled , so as to prevent her coming up with the Squadron all the Time
she was in Company afterwards ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,8.119

<font> A. <$$font> Nothing visible by the Sail she carried next Day .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,8.120

<font> Two Accounts were now given into Court , of the Damage of the
Masts <$$font> , &c. <font> on Board the <$$font> Lenox , <font> Copies
whereof are as follow <$$font> , viz. An Account of the Sails and
Rigging damaged on Board his Majesty's Ship the <font> Lenox <$$font> ,

<font> Signed Tho. Carter <$$font> , Carpenter .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,9.134

<font> Q. <$$font> Was any of the <font> Lenox <$$font> 's Masts and
Yards got down or shifted , and others got up in their room , during the
Time she continued in Company afterwards ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,9.135

<font> A. <$$font> The Top-Gallant Masts Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font>
was getting down , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,9.136

and the Admiral sent him Orders to keep them up , and not to get any
down . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,9.137

<font> Q. <$$font> Might the <font> Lenox <$$font> , if she had obeyed
my Signal and Orders , have pursued the Enemy's Ships in the Night , and
prevented some of them getting into the <font> Havannah ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,9.138

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Lenox <$$font> , had she obeyed the
Admiral's Orders , and come to close Action , might have greatly
contributed to their being stopt . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,9.139

During Day-light did not , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,9.140

but ca@ @n't be certain what was done in the Night .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,9.141

<font> Court . <$$font> How did the <font> Lenox <$$font> behave in the
Beginning of the Action ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,9.142

<font> A. <$$font> Very well . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,9.143

Adm. <font> Knowles <$$font> answers , <font> she did behave so well in
the Beginning of the Action , that I applauded him publickly upon the
Quarter-Deck , and was very much surprised at his Behaviour afterwards .
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,9.144

<P_10>

<font> Court . <$$font> How long did she continue to behave so well ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.146

<font> A. <$$font> All the way in passing the three Ships , she behaved
as well as any Ship could do , till she shot up upon the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> 's Quarter . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.147

<font> Q. <$$font> Might not the Loss of the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Fore-topsail , and her being disabled in her Sails and Rigging ,
occasion her to loose that Way which before kept her a Head of the
<font> Lenox ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.148

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Cornwal <$$font> had her Foresail set ,
and her Maintopsail as far as the Slings , as it appeared to me .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.149

<font> Q. <$$font> How near was the <font> Lenox <$$font> to the <font>
Cornwal <$$font> when she was a Stern , and you saw her Fire .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.150

<font> A. <$$font> At the first of the Action I believe about a Cable's
Length . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.151

<font> Q. <$$font> What Sail had she abroad at that Time , at the
beginning of the Action ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.152

<font> A. <$$font> Her Foresail set . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.153

<font> Q. <$$font> As the <font> Lenox <$$font> when she began to
engage with the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , and kept in her own proper
Station , had her Foresail set ; and when you came upon Deck to look at
her upon your Weather-Quarter , her Foresail was up ; whether it is not
your Opinion that the Damage the <font> Cornwal <$$font> had received in
her Sails and Yards , at that Time , was the Cause of the <font> Lenox
<$$font> shooting up upon your Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.154

<font> A. <$$font> As I had not seen the Proceedings of Capt. <font>
Holmes <$$font> for near half an Hour before , in what manner he had
shortened Sail within that half Hour , I can@ @not be a proper Judge .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.155

<font> Admiral <$$font> Knowles <font> offers to produce a Plan , to
shew the Situation of the Ships , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.156

but the Court would not admit of it . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,10.157

<font> Court . <$$font> At the Time Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font> saw
the <font> Lenox <$$font> pass to Leeward of the <font> Cornwal <$$font>
, and hawl her <P_11> Wind when a Head of him , how did the <font>
Spanish <$$font> Squadron then bear ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.158

<font> A. <$$font> I judge about four Points to the Lee-Bow .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.159

<font> Q. <$$font> How long afterwards was it before you was sent to
Capt. <font> Holmes ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.160

<font> A. <$$font> I believe it was not a quarter of an Hour ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.161

no , I could not be so long as a quarter of an Hour .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.162

<font> Q. <$$font> Was not Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> at that Time
engaged ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.163

<font> A. <$$font> He fired three or four Guns every now and then , as
I was going to him in the Boat . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.164

<font> Q. <$$font> Supposing the <font> Spaniards <$$font> were four
Points upon the Weather-Bow , and the <font> Lenox <$$font> to Windward
of you , could they in that Time by hawling up have come within Gun-Shot
, unless the <font> Lenox <$$font> had bore down to them ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.165

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Spaniards <$$font> had hawled up about a
quarter of an Hour , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.166

and Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> and the Enemy did not reach .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.167

<font> Q. <$$font> Could they and the <font> Lenox <$$font> have come
to Action in that Time , unless they had met each other ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.168

<font> Capt. <$$font> Holmes <font> moved , that Mr. <$$font> Knowles
<font> should be sworn , and that as Mr. <$$font> Knowles <font> is now
to be examined as an Evidence , Capt. <$$font> Taylor <font> should
retire , which he did accordingly ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.169

and the Rear-Admiral was thereupon sworn . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.170

Mr. <font> Knowles <$$font> says , when the <font> Spanish <$$font>
Admiral was put to Flight , he hoisted a <font> Biscay <$$font> Ensign ,
which he understood afterwards by the <font> Spanish <$$font> Capt. was
for every one to take Care of himself , when the whole <font> Spanish
<$$font> Squadron bore away round , at least four or five Points from
the Course they had been steering before ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,11.171

the three Ships a-stern of the Admiral , having shot up to <P_12> cover
their Admiral , were so close , they were almost on Board of each other
by the Time the <font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral was got near out of
Random Shot of me . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.172

The <font> Lenox <$$font> passed by me close to Leeward with her
Foresail and Topsails , and I believe some of her Staysails ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.173

and as she passed fired at these Sternmost Ships , which were coming up
, HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.174

and then sprung her Luff a-head of me a little upon my Weather-Bow , in
which Position she continued going under that Sail , till I sent my Boat
on Board of her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.175

The <font> Spanish <$$font> Rear-Admiral being attacked by the <font>
Strafford <$$font> , and the <font> Canterbury <$$font> coming up with
the Sternmost , the <font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral instead of
continuing his Courses , hawled up about three Points , as did the other
Sternmost Ships ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.176

this brought them nearer to my Headmost than otherwise they would have
been , and particularly the <font> Lenox <$$font> ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.177

and by this Means they kept firing a few Guns at each other ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.178

when my Boat got aboard the <font> Lenox <$$font> , I soon afterwards
saw her shiver her Maintopsail and bear away , and in a few Minutes
afterwards Luff up again , and hawl her Mizen out ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.179

and continued going pretty near in the same Position she was in before ;
whereas had she continued bearing down in Obedience to my Orders , we
must presently have been along Side of the <font> Spanish <$$font>
Admiral , or some other of the Sternmost Ships .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.180

<font> Court . <$$font> Did you fire any Shot from the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> , after the <font> Lenox <$$font> passed to Leeward of you ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.181

<font> A. <$$font> Capt. <font> Taylor . <$$font> I believe there
might be four or five loose Guns , the general Orders being given to
stop firing . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.182

I thought them too far distant before they came on my Quarter .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.183

<font> Q. <$$font> If the General Signal for chasing to Leeward was at
that Time made , was not the <font> Lenox <$$font> at Liberty to take
what Ship she thought fit ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,12.184

<P_13>

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.186

<font> Court . <$$font> Were the three <font> Spanish <$$font> Ships
a-stern of the <font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral , engaged with the <font>
Cornwal <$$font> , during the Time the <font> Lenox <$$font> was upon
the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.187

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Warwick <$$font> and <font> Canterbury
<$$font> not making Sail to get up into their {TEXT:ther} proper Station
to engage the three Sternmost Ships of the Enemy , they sailed to cover
their Admiral , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.188

and kept firing at the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , while the <font> Lenox
<$$font> was upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.189

<font> Q. <$$font> Did the <font> Lenox <$$font> during that Time keep
firing her after Guns ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.190

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.191

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Do you think the <font> Lenox's <$$font>
coming up upon your Weather-Quarter was accidentally or inadvertently ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.192

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Lenox <$$font> not bearing down so near
to the Enemy , as the <font> Cornwal <$$font> did , and not minding the
Navigation of the Ship so much as fighting , I admit it to be accidental
her coming on the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.193

<font> Q. <$$font> When the <font> Lenox <$$font> passed to Leeward of
you , did not you put your Helm a-Weather and run down to the <font>
Conquistador <$$font> , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.194

and did not that bring the <font> Lenox <$$font> upon your Larbord Bow ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.195

<font> A. <$$font> Near a quarter of an Hour before I bore away large .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.196

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did you go before the Wind then ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.197

<font> A. <$$font> It was almost dark before I got before the Wind .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.198

<font> Q. <$$font> When was it Mr. <font> Knowles <$$font> made use of
his Stern Chase_Guns upon the Enemy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.199

Admiral <font> Knowles <$$font> answers ; <font> never in my Life
<$$font> ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.200

<font> my Stern was never to them . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.201

<font> Court . <$$font> Did the <font> Cornwal <$$font> bear away after
she had lost her Maintop-Mast , and before Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font>
was sent on Board the <font> Lenox ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,13.202

<P_14>

<font> A. <$$font> She was not wore when Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font>
went away . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.204

<font> Then he withdrew . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.205

Lieutenant <font> Mitchell's <$$font> Examination .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.206

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font> ,
during the Action with the <font> Spanish <$$font> Squadron on the first
of <font> October <$$font> , run upon the <font> Cornwal <$$font> 's
Weather-Quarter , almost along Side , and lay there for the Space of
half an Hour , so as she could fire scarce any of her Guns clear of the
<font> Cornwal <$$font> , but a few of the Aftermost , and those not
without Danger of firing into me ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.207

<font> A. <$$font> She was upon the Weather-Quarter ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.208

I believe her Head might be as far as the Forepart of the Quarter-Deck
when I saw her , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.209

but how long she had been there I can@ @not say .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.210

<font> Q. <$$font> During the Time the <font> Lenox <$$font> lay upon
the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter , had not the Enemy's
Sternmost Ships shot up to cover their Admiral , and kept firing upon
the <font> Cornwal ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.211

<font> A. <$$font> The Sternmost Ships did fire upon the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.212

but I can@ @not recollect whether they shot up or not .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.213

<font> Court . <$$font> How long did the <font> Lenox <$$font> continue
upon your Weather-Quarter after you saw her , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.214

and what Sail had she then set ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.215

<font> A. <$$font> When I first saw her I was at my Quarters :
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.216

I heard Mr. <font> Knowles <$$font> hailing her upon the Weather
Gangway , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.217

and he seemed to be out of Breath , upon which I desired him to give me
the Trumpet , and he did , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.218

and I hailed her myself ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.219

when I went up she had dropt her Foresail , Maintopsail , Aback ,
Foretopsail full , and Mizen-topsail full . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.220

<font> Court . <$$font> Do you think at dropping her Foresail , she was
endeavouring to ware a-Stern ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,14.221

<P_15>

<font> A. <$$font> I imagine it was either to ware , or make Sail
a-head of us . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.223

<font> Q. <$$font> Upon observing your Admiral hailing her , and being
out of Breath , you say you got upon the Gangway to assist him ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.224

why did you quit him unless you thought his Orders were executed , or
going to be executed ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.225

<font> A. <$$font> I imagin'd the Service was done , by her dropping
her Foresail . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.226

<font> Q. <$$font> What was the Orders you delivered to the <font>
Lenox ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.227

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not recollect the Words .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.228

<font> Q. <$$font> Do@ @n't you recollect the sense of them ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.229

<font> A. <$$font> I believe to make Sail , or bear away .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.230

<font> Q. <$$font> What called you from the Execution of this Service ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.231

<font> A. <$$font> To go to my Guns again . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.232

<font> Q. <$$font> Was this before or after the Maintop-Mast was Shot ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.233

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't really say which .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.234

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Could the Enemy's Sternmost Ships have
shot up to fire upon the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , if the <font> Lenox
<$$font> had kept her proper Station astern of her , in the Line of
Battle , as she might have done ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.235

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't really say . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.236

<font> Q. <$$font> After the Enemy were put to Flight , and Capt.
<font> Holmes <$$font> wore under the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Stern ,
did he not to Leeward of her , spring his Luff , and hawl out upon the
Weather-Bow ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.237

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say whether the <font> Lenox <$$font>
was to Windward or to Leeward . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.238

I saw the <font> Lenox <$$font> upon her Weather-Bow , when the Enemy
were put to Flight , a little before Night . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.239

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Had not you bore away to the Northward ,
after the <font> Conquistador <$$font> , before you saw me upon your
Weather-Bow ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,15.240

<P_16>

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't really say , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.242

but to the best of my Knowledge we had not . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.243

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Do you know any thing of my sending my
Boat on Board the <font> Lenox <$$font> to order her to pursue the Enemy
? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.244

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't say I recollect any thing of it .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.245

<font> Q. <$$font> Was not the Signal made for chasing to Leeward when
the Enemy were put to Flight ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.246

<font> A. <$$font> I saw the Signal out , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.247

but do@ @n't know at what Time it was made , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.248

for I was at my Quarters . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.249

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not the <font> Strafford <$$font> , soon after
the Enemy were put to Flight , enter into Action again with the <font>
Spanish <$$font> Vice-Admiral ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.250

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't say whether she did or not :
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.251

I do@ @n't remember any thing of it . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.252

<font> Q. <$$font> Might not Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> , if he had
obeyed the Signal for chasing to Leeward , have got into close Action
again with any of the Enemy's Ships before dark ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.253

<font> A. <$$font> I should believe that he could , if that the other
did not make Sail . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.254

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did not I get into close Action before Dark
? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.255

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't really say . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.256

<font> Court . <$$font> Do you remember the <font> Lenox <$$font>
passing to Leeward of the <font> Cornwal ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.257

<font> A. <$$font> I saw her to Leeward , upon the Weather-Bow , a
little after five . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.258

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the <font> Lenox <$$font> engaged any
part of that Day ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.259

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I saw her just after we came to Action .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.260

<font> Q. <$$font> At what Distance ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.261

<font> A. <$$font> Not a great Distance . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.262

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the <font> Cornwal <$$font> disabled in her
Masts and Sails before you saw the <font> Lenox <$$font> upon your
Weather-Quarter , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.263

and in what Manner was she disabled ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,16.264

<P_17>

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't say whether her Maintop-Mast was gone or
not ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.266

I believe some of her Stays were shot away , and some of her
running_Rigging : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.267

I ca@ @n't say whether her Foretopsail was down upon the Cap , or not .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.268

<font> Q. <$$font> When the Enemy a-stern of the Rear-Admiral passed
a-head of you ; were any of the <font> English <$$font> Ships betwixt
them and you ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.269

<font> A. <$$font> No , I do@ @n't remember .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.270

<font> And then he withdrew . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.271

<font> Captain <$$font> Brodie , <font> of the <$$font> Strafford .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.272

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Did you see the <font> Lenox <$$font>
upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter during the Action on
the first of <font> October <$$font> , 1748 ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.273

<font> A. <$$font> No , Sir . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.274

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not the Lenox after the <font> Spanish <$$font>
Admiral was put to flight pass to the Leeward of the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> , spring her Luff again , and hawl up on the <font> Cornwal's
<$$font> Weather-Bow ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.275

<font> A. <$$font> I saw her pass to Leeward , and come betwixt me and
the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , upon my Larboard-Quarter .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.276

<font> Q. <$$font> When the Enemy was put to Flight , did not I make
the general Signal for chasing to Leeward ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.277

<font> A. <$$font> You did . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.278

<font> Q. <$$font> How long after the Signal was made might it be
before you got into Action with the <font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.279

<font> A. <$$font> But a very few Minutes , except the Time that the
<font> Conquistador <$$font> fell a-stern betwixt me and the <font>
Spanish <$$font> Admiral . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.280

<font> Q. <$$font> Might not Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> if he had
directly obeyed the Signal for chasing , after the Enemy was put to
Flight , have got into Action again as soon as the <font> Strafford
<$$font> , if he had made all the Sail he could ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,17.281

<P_18>

<font> Q. <$$font> I believe he might HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.283

and there was a great Murmuring betwixt the <font> Strafford <$$font> 's
People , on Account of the <font> Lenox <$$font> not coming down .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.284

<font> Court . <$$font> What Distance was the <font> Lenox <$$font>
from the <font> Strafford <$$font> , at that Time you entered into
Action upon the Signal ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.285

<font> A. <$$font> But a small Distance upon my Larboard-Quarter , when
Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font> in a Boat passed by me ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.286

the <font> Cornwal , Lenox <$$font> , and <font> Strafford <$$font> were
very near together then , and very near to the Body of the <font>
Spanish <$$font> Squadron . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.287

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> In the Evening did not the <font> Lenox
<$$font> fire into the <font> Strafford <$$font> , and oblige the
Soldiers and Marines to go off the Poop . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.288

Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> answers . <font> I allow it after Dark ,
as to my Firing . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.289

Capt. <font> Brodie . <$$font> Before and after Dark I hailed him ,
till I could not speak for Hoarseness , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.290

and then my Officers on the Quarter-Deck hailed him ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.291

and put forth distinguishing Lights to see if that would stop him .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.292

<font> Q. <$$font> Did the <font> Lenox <$$font> upon your hailing of
her , bear down closer to the Enemy afterwards ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.293

<font> A. <$$font> No , she continued there I believe three quarters of
an Hour , and better , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.294

and then hawled away . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.295

<font> Q. <$$font> Might not Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> , if he had
bore down directly when you hailed him , have come to close Engagement
with any of those three Ships which you and the <font> Canterbury
<$$font> were then engaging with ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.296

<font> A. <$$font> Certainly he might . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.297

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the <font> Lenox <$$font> afterwards
engaged with any of the Ships that Night ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.298

<font> A. <$$font> No , I did not see her afterwards till about 11
o'Clock , after we had parted with the <font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,18.299

I saw a Ship coming down right <P_19> before the Wind , looking at us ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.300

and then hawled away to the Northward . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.301

<font> Q. <$$font> When the <font> Lenox <$$font> joined the Squadron
the Day after the Action , did you see any thing so disabled on Board
her , as to prevent her keeping up with me , and the Squadron all the
Time she was in Company afterwards ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.302

<font> A. <$$font> Next Morning she had got one or both of her
Top-Gallant-Yards down , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.303

but saw very little visible Damage of her Masts and Rigging , as it
appeared to me . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.304

<font> Q. <$$font> If the <font> Lenox <$$font> had pursued the Enemy's
Ships and attacked them close according to my Signal , do you think then
Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> could not have prevented some or other of
the Enemy's Ships from getting into the <font> Havanna ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.305

<font> A. <$$font> I think if the <font> Strafford <$$font> had been
seconded by the <font> Lenox <$$font> , before and after the <font>
Canterbury <$$font> came up to her Assistance , the <font> Spanish
<$$font> Squadron might thoroughly have been destroyed .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.306

<font> Q. <$$font> Did Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> during the Action
do his utmost to take and endamage the Enemy ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.307

<font> A. <$$font> I think not . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.308

<font> Q. <$$font> Had not the Admiral that commanded that Squadron
great Cause to complain , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.309

and had you commanded it yourself , would not you have complained , if
you had been no better seconded than I was ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.310

<font> A. <$$font> I think he had , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.311

and I certainly should have said so , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.312

and shall always think so . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.313

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did you never give Orders ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.314

or was it not minuted in the <font> Strafford's <$$font> Log-Book ,
written by your Order , that the Admiral was not half an Hour in Action
? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.315

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't know that I ever read the <font>
Strafford's <$$font> Log-Book , of the Transactions of that Day .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,19.316

The Day afterwards being on Board the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , and
finding Mr. <font> Knowles <$$font> intended to inquire into <P_20> the
Conduct of the Gentlemen he found fault with , when I returned on Board
, I ordered the Officers to recollect the most material Things of the
Action of the Day , in Case they should be called upon at a
Court-Martial . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.317

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the <font> Lenox <$$font> engaged at Sun-set on
the first of <font> October ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.318

<font> A. <$$font> I believe she was , at a great Distance ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.319

she was wide on my Larboard Quarter . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.320

<font> Q. <$$font> Was it not a very dark Night ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.321

and might not the <font> Lenox <$$font> be engaged in the Night and you
not see her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.322

<font> A. <$$font> The Night was far from being Dark ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.323

it was a very clear Night , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.324

and the <font> Lenox <$$font> was wide of my Weather-Quarter , till
about eight o'Clock , when she hawled off , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.325

and I was left with three of the <font> Spanish <$$font> Ships ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.326

and do@ @n't know that she was in Action afterwards .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.327

It is impossible to be exact in the Time ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.328

it might be a little before or after eight , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.329

but I am certain that I was the last Ship that was left with the <font>
Spanish <$$font> Squadron . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.330

<font> Court . <$$font> At the Time the <font> Lenox <$$font> passed to
Leeward of the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , and hawled the Wind of her ,
was you engaged at that Time in your Ship ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.331

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.332

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the <font> Lenox <$$font> engaged at that Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.333

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , she kept firing after she was to Leeward of
the <font> Cornwal . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.334

<font> Q. <$$font> Did she continue to fire after she was a-head of the
<font> Cornwal ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.335

<font> A. <$$font> She greatly slackened then in her Fire , which made
me imagine some extraordinary Accident had happened , that she did not
come down according to the Signal , and her Fire slackening at the same
Time . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.336

<font> Q. <$$font> What Ship was she then engaged with ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,20.337

<P_21>

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Spanish <$$font> Admirals second a-stern
was coming up at the same Time , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.339

and she was firing at the Ships a-stern . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.340

<font> Q. <$$font> Afterwards , when the <font> Lenox <$$font> fired
into the <font> Strafford <$$font> , what Distance was the <font>
Strafford <$$font> from the Enemy , and what Distance the <font> Lenox
<$$font> from the <font> Strafford ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.341

<font> A. <$$font> We were within Hail of each other :
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.342

I was within Hail of the <font> Spaniards <$$font> , and the <font>
Lenox <$$font> within Hail of me . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.343

<font> Q. <$$font> You gave in your Opinion the Admiral was not well
seconded , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.344

what were the Ships that did engage properly that Day , from the Time of
the Beginning of the Action , till it was so Dark you could distinguish
the Ships no more ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.345

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Cornwal <$$font> , the <font> Strafford
<$$font> , and the <font> Canterbury <$$font> , and the <font> Lenox
<$$font> , I think , were in a very good Line the Beginning of the
Action , with the <font> Strafford <$$font> and <font> Cornwal .
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.346

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you think that four Ships , one of which mounted
but 56 Guns , and did not all that Time behave <paren> as you think
<$$paren> properly , did defeat six Ships , such as the <font> Spaniards
<$$font> hath appeared to have been ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.347

<font> A. <$$font> There were but five Ships , as the <font> Tilbury
<$$font> was gone off with the <font> Spanish <$$font> Rear-Admiral
a-head , and the <font> Galga <$$font> Frigate was one of them ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.348

and I believe they would have been all taken had it not been for the
<font> Cornwal's <$$font> Maintop-Mast being shot away .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.349

<font> Q. <$$font> When the <font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral got away
from the Ships that did pursue , was he not disabled ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.350

and how came he to make his Escape ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.351

<font> A. <$$font> About ten o'Clock at Night I fell in with him again
, HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.352

got close up along side of him , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.353

and fired three or four Broadsides into him .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.354

I am sure if the Main-Yard had been across , we might have interlocked
one with another . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,21.355

I hailed him <P_22> several Times , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.356

and ordered him to strike , which he returned with a Volley of small
Arms , and never fired one great Gun at me all the Time I was along Side
of him : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.357

Both Main and Mizen-Masts were then gone , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.358

but notwithstanding my Fore-sail was up , I shot a-head of him , when my
first Lieutenant , Master , and Pilot , desired for God's Sake , I would
think of saving my own Ship , for that they saw the Breakers of the
Shore . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.359

I offered my Pilot 1000 Pistoles , out of my own Pocket , to take charge
of the Ship , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.360

and he told me he would take Charge of her no longer ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.361

for if she was lost , he should be called to an Account for it :
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.362

and the <font> Canterbury <$$font> exchanged a Broad-side ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.363

and wore on Account of the Shore . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.364

<font> Q. <$$font> During the Time you was so smartly engaged , what
presence of Mind ; what Calmness ; what Serenity must you be possessed
with to observe what the Ships a-head and a-stern of you were doing ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.365

and your Behaviour during the Action merits being taken Notice of by
this Court ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.366

and I am glad to see there is one Gentleman so great a Master of his
Passions . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.367

- As to myself I must confess I would give all I am possessed with to
have so great a Command over my own at such a Time .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.368

<font> A. <$$font> The Quarter-Deck was flush fore and aft ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.369

and I appointed an Officer with my Glass to observe the Signals , and my
Clerk , who lay upon his Belly , to minute all the Transactions down as
I should direct him , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.370

and did direct every Signal . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.371

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did not Capt. <font> Brodie <$$font> beat
his Master in the Time of Action , with a speaking Trumpet .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.372

<font> A. <$$font> No , I never beat any Officer that I had in my Life
; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.373

I threatened the Master to confine him , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.374

but the Day after upon his Acknowledgment of his Misbehaviour I released
him . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.375

<font> Then he withdrew . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,22.376

<P_23>

<font> Captain <$$font> Whitrong Taylor , <font> first Lieutenant of the
<$$font> Cornwal , <font> quartered upon the upper Deck . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.378

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font>
during the Action with the <font> Spanish <$$font> Squadron on the first
of <font> October <$$font> run up upon the <font> Cornwall's <$$font>
Weather-Quarter almost along-side , and lie there for the space of half
an Hour , so as she could scarce fire any Guns but a few of the
aftermost clear of her , and these not without great Danger of firing
into her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.379

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I saw her upon the Weather-Quarter ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.380

but how long she might be there I ca@ @n't tell .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.381

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not I , and several of my Officers hail Capt.
<font> Holmes <$$font> , and order him to cease firing , back his Sail ,
and drop a-stern into his Station ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.382

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I heard the Admiral hail him ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.383

and I hailed him . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.384

<font> Court . <$$font> What Sail had the <font> Lenox <$$font> when
you saw her upon the Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.385

<font> A. <$$font> I think she luffed up in the Wind , with three
Topsails , to the best of my Remembrance , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.386

and I believe her Top-Gallant Sail was loose down upon the Cap , to the
best of my Remembrance . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.387

<font> Q. <$$font> Upon hailing of her did she alter her Position ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.388

or what did she do ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.389

<font> A. <$$font> I did not see her do any thing ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.390

for I went away . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.391

<font> Q. <$$font> Do@ @n't you know whether her Mizen was hawled out ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.392

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't know . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.393

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> During the Time the <font> Lenox
<$$font> lay upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter , did
not the Enemy's Sternmost Ships shoot up to cover their Admiral , and
fire at the <font> Cornwal ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.394

<font> A. <$$font> I saw their Rear cover their Admiral , very close ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.395

and they fired at us , and the <font> Lenox <$$font> I believe .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,23.396

<P_24>

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not the Enemy's Sternmost Ships shoot away the
<font> Cornwal's <$$font> Maintop-Mast , and disable her so in her
Rigging , that she could not pursue the Enemy afterward , when they ran
? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.398

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I imagine it was their Rear that shot away her
Maintop-Mast , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.399

and we were so disabled in our Rigging that we could not follow them .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.400

<font> Q. <$$font> Could the Enemy's Sternmost Ships have done this ,
if the <font> Lenox <$$font> had kept her proper Station a-stern of the
<font> Cornwal <$$font> , in a Line of Battle , as she might have done ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.401

<font> A. <$$font> I believe they would not have fired so much at us ,
if she had been a-stern of us . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.402

<font> Q. <$$font> If the <font> Warwick <$$font> and <font> Canterbury
<$$font> had been then likewise in their proper Station a-stern of the
<font> Cornwal <$$font> , could any of the Enemy's Ships then have done
her any Damage ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.403

<font> A. <$$font> No , they would have been otherwise engaged .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.404

<font> Q. <$$font> After the Enemy were put to Flight , did not Capt.
<font> Holmes <$$font> wear under the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Stern ,
hawl up to Leeward of her , spring her Luff , and hawl out upon her
Weather-Bow ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.405

<font> A. <$$font> I did not see her hawl her Mizen out ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.406

but I saw her go to Leeward , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.407

and saw her afterwards upon her Weather-Bow .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.408

<font> Q. <$$font> When the general Signal was made to chase to Leeward
, did Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> obey it , till I was obliged to send
my Boat on Board with Orders for him to go and pursue the Enemy ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.409

<font> A. <$$font> I did not see Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> bear
away . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.410

<font> Court . <$$font> Did you see him ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.411

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I was upon the Quarter-Deck .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.412

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> After these Orders were sent did you
see the <font> Lenox <$$font> make all the Sail she could to get up with
the Enemy , while Day-Light lasted ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,24.413

<P_25>

<font> A. <$$font> The most I ever saw was Top Gallant Sails and three
Topsails , and Foresail ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.415

her Head was standing towards the Enemy . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.416

<font> Q. <$$font> Might not the <font> Lenox <$$font> , if she had
directly obeyed the Signal for chasing to Leeward , when the Enemy was
put to Flight , have got up to Action again as close and as soon as the
<font> Strafford <$$font> did ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.417

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I think she might .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.418

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Was the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Maintop-Mast gone when the <font> Lenox <$$font> was upon her
Weather-Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.419

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I saw her upon the Weather-Quarter , before
and after her Maintop-Mast was gone : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.420

It was shot away while she was there . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.421

<font> Q. <$$font> What did the <font> Cornwal <$$font> do after the
<font> Lenox <$$font> was passed to Leeward ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.422

did she put her Helm a Starboard , or a Port ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.423

<font> A. <$$font> I really do@ @n't know . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.424

<font> Court . <$$font> What space of Time was there betwixt your
seeing , and hailing the <font> Lenox <$$font> upon your Weather-Quarter
? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.425

<font> A. <$$font> Not above six or eight Minutes when I hailed her ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.426

for she was then almost in our Wake , a little to Windward of us .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.427

<font> Q. <$$font> What Distance of Time was there betwixt your first
seeing her , when you was upon the Middle-Deck , till the Time she
passed under your Lee Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.428

<font> A. <$$font> As near as I can guess upwards of half an Hour .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.429

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you think he came upon your Quarter designedly ,
or from Accident , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.430

or did he go there to screen himself ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.431

Adm. <font> Knowles <$$font> answers . <font> I do@ @n't believe it
was his Design ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.432

neither do I accuse him of coming there to shun the Enemy . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,25.433

<P_26>

<font> Court . <$$font> You say you saw the <font> Lenox <$$font> when
the Signal was out upon your Weather-Bow , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.435

was the <font> Lenox <$$font> that Time engaged ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.436

<font> A. <$$font> It seemed to me she was engaged , and fired at the
<font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral , as I took it to be .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.437

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the <font> Lenox <$$font> at any Time
not engaged , when she might have engaged ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.438

<font> A. <$$font> Not that I took Notice of ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.439

for I saw her but very little after that . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.440

<font> Q. <$$font> At the Time she was a-head , and firing at the Enemy
, if she had bore away , could she not have engaged the Enemy nearer
than what she was ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.441

<font> A. <$$font> I think she could . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.442

<font> Q. <$$font> What Distance was the <font> Lenox <$$font> from the
nearest <font> Spanish <$$font> Ship ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.443

<font> A. <$$font> I believe about half a Mile .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.444

<font> Q. <$$font> Was she within Gun-shot ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.445

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.446

<font> Then he withdrew . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.447

<font> Lieutenant <$$font> Hind , <font> third Lieutenant on Board the
<$$font> Cornwal , <font> quartered on the lower Gun Deck . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.448

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font>
during the Action with the <font> Spanish <$$font> Squadron , on the
first of <font> October <$$font> , 1748 , run upon the <font> Cornwal's
<$$font> Weather-Quarter {TEXT:Weather-Qurrter} , hawl along side , and
lie there for the space of half an Hour , so as she could scarce fire
any Guns , but a few of the aftermost clear of her , and those not
without great Danger of firing into her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.449

<font> A. <$$font> I saw the <font> Lenox <$$font> upon the <font>
Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter , that she could not fire several of
her Guns clear of her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.450

<font> Court . <$$font> How far upon your Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.451

<font> A. <$$font> I believe about a-breast of our main Chains .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,26.452

<P_27>

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> How long might she lie there then from
the first of your seeing her till the Time she wore under your Stern ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.454

<font> A. <$$font> I took Notice of her a considerable Time ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.455

but can@ @not tell exactly the Time , because I was employed upon the
lower Gun-Deck . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.456

<font> Court . <$$font> What Sail had she abroad ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.457

and in what Position was her Sails when you saw her ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.458

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't remember . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.459

Mr. <font> Knowles . <$$font> During the Time the <font> Lenox
<$$font> lay upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter , did
not the Enemy's Sternmost Ships shoot up to cover their Admiral , and
keep firing upon the <font> Cornwal . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.460

<font> A. <$$font> They were close up with their Admiral ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.461

and kept firing upon the <font> Cornwal . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.462

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not the Enemy's Sternmost Ships shoot away the
<font> Cornwal's <$$font> Maintop-Mast , and disable her in her Rigging
, that she could not pursue the Enemy when they ran ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.463

<font> A. <$$font> I was upon the lower Gun-Deck ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.464

and could not see the Maintop-Mast shot away ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.465

but I was told so afterwards . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.466

<font> Q. <$$font> So close as the <font> Cornwal <$$font> engaged the
<font> Spanish <$$font> Rear-Admiral do you apprehend that any of the
Guns could have shot it away ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.467

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.468

<font> Q. <$$font> Could the Enemy's Sternmost Ships have fired
{TEXT:fifed} upon the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , if the <font> Lenox
<$$font> had kept her Station a-stern , and engaged in Line of Battle as
she might , and ought to have done ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.469

<font> A. <$$font> They could not have disabled the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> so much as she had been , if the <font> Lenox <$$font> had kept
her Station a-stern . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.470

<font> Q. <$$font> After the Enemy were put to Flight , did not the
<font> Lenox <$$font> pass close to Leeward of the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> , spring her Luff , and hawl out again upon her Weather-Bow ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,27.471

<P_28>

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Lenox <$$font> passed close to Leeward of
the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.473

and I saw her upon the Weather-Bow out of the Weather-Port .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.474

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know any thing of my sending my Boat on Board
with Orders to pursue the Enemy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.475

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.476

<font> Q. <$$font> After the Enemy were put to Flight , and the general
Signal to chase to Leeward , did you see the <font> Lenox <$$font> make
all the Sail she could to get up with them , while Day-light lasted ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.477

<font> A. <$$font> When I came upon Deck I saw the <font> Lenox
<$$font> to Windward of the Enemy , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.478

but do not remember that she made any Sail towards them ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.479

nor did I take further Notice of her afterwards .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.480

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did the <font> Cornwal <$$font> run down to
the <font> Conquistador <$$font> before you came upon Deck ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.481

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Cornwal <$$font> , when I came upon Deck
, was going to hoist the Foretopsail in order to go down to the <font>
Conquistador <$$font> , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.482

but can@ @not well remember whether she had bore down at that Time .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.483

<font> Court . <$$font> Did you hear the Orders given for hoisting it ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.484

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.485

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did not you bear away so as to bring the
Wind upon your Starboard-Quarter in bearing down to her .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.486

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.487

<font> Q. <$$font> {TEXT:missing_"Q."} Do you remember whether the
<font> Cornwal <$$font> made use of her Stern-Guns ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.488

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , she did . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.489

<font> Q. <$$font> Upon what Ship ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.490

<font> A. <$$font> Some of the Enemy's Ships ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.491

but which in particular I know not . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.492

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not the <font> Conquistador <$$font> go away by
herself , and the rest of the Squadron keep together ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.493

<font> A. <$$font> When I saw them the <font> Spanish <$$font> Squadron
were not together . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,28.494

<P_29>

<font> Q. <$$font> How many of them were together ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.496

<font> A. <$$font> There were two of them that I took Notice of in
particular , one that the <font> Tilbury <$$font> was engaged with , and
one that was coming down to the <font> Conquistador <$$font> ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.497

but I ca@ @n't remember the Situation of the rest of the Squadron .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.498

<font> Court . <$$font> When you saw the <font> Lenox <$$font> a-head
of the Admiral , was she then engaged ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.499

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I saw her fire some Guns ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.500

for I continued looking at her some Time . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.501

<font> Q. <$$font> What Distance was she from the Enemy when you saw
her fire ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.502

<font> A. <$$font> She was a-way a-head of us , and to Leeward ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.503

she bore away from the <font> Cornwal <$$font> at this Time ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.504

but know not at what Distance : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.505

I did not take Notice of that . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.506

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you during that Day take Notice that the <font>
Lenox <$$font> did not behave properly as she ought to have done ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.507

and did you hear any of your Brother Lieutenants of the Ship take Notice
of the same that Day ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.508

<font> A. <$$font> As I was down below myself , I could not take Notice
of her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.509

After the <font> Cornwal <$$font> had done firing I took Notice of the
<font> Lenox <$$font> , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.510

and thought at that Time that she was rather at too great a Distance
from the Enemy , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.511

and heard the Officers find fault with Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> for
the same . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.512

<font> Here the Prosecutor for the Crown closed his Evidence , except as
to the Testimony of Capt. <$$font> Trelawney , <font> who upon Account
of his Illness could not attend the first Day ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.513

and therefore at Mr. <$$font> Knowles's <font> Request , his
Examination was reserved until the next Day , but that in the mean Time
Capt. <$$font> Holmes <font> might enter upon his Defence .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.514

Accordingly Capt. <$$font> Trelawney <font> was the next Day examined ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,29.515

and for the convenience of placing all the Evidence for the Crown
together , this Gentleman's is <P_30> inserted in this Place , altho' in
the Course of the Witnesses , it did not come in until after the
Examination of Lieutenant <$$font> Skreen , <font> the third Witness
produced on the behalf of Capt. <$$font> Holmes .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.516

<font> Capt. <$$font> Trelawney , <font> of Soldiers on Board the
<$$font> Cornwal . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.517

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font> ,
during the Action with the <font> Spanish <$$font> Squadron on the first
of <font> October <$$font> , run upon the <font> Cornwal <$$font> 's
Weather-Quarter , hawl along Side , and lie there for the Space of half
an Hour , so that she could scarce fire any of her Guns but a few of the
aftermost clear of her , and those not without great Danger of firing
into the <font> Cornwal ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.518

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Lenox <$$font> did run up upon her
Quarter , and almost so as to hinder most of the Guns ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.519

and I believe she might be there for the Space of twenty Minutes or more
, to the best of my Knowledge . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.520

<font> Q. <$$font> During the Time the <font> Lenox <$$font> lay upon
the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter , did not the Enemy's
Sternmost Ships shoot up to cover their Admiral , and fire upon the
<font> Cornwal ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.521

<font> A. <$$font> I think they did . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.522

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not {TEXT:not_not} the Enemy's Sternmost Ships
shoot away the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Maintop-Mast , and otherwise
disable her so , that she could not pursue the Enemy afterwards , when
they ran ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.523

<font> A. <$$font> The Sternmost Ships , I believe , certainly carried
our Maintop-Mast away , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.524

and that disabled her , I certainly believe .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.525

<font> Court . <$$font> Was the Top-Mast carried away before the <font>
Lenox <$$font> came upon your Quarter , or after ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.526

<font> A. <$$font> I think just as the <font> Lenox <$$font> was
dropping a-stern of us . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,30.527

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Could the Enemy's Ships have disabled
the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , if the <font> Lenox <$$font> had kept her
<P_31> proper Station a-stern of her , and engaged in the line of Battle
, as she ought to have done ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.528

<font> A. <$$font> I believe not so immediately ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.529

I ca@ @n't tell what a Chance Shot might do .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.530

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not I and several of my Officers hail the <font>
Lenox <$$font> several Times , and order her to cease firing , back her
Sails , and drop a-stern into her Station ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.531

<font> A. <$$font> I heard the Admiral , and several others ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.532

and I hailed her myself . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.533

<font> Q. <$$font> While the Enemy's Sternmost Ships were firing upon
the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , did not the Men call out , what is there
no body to second the Admiral ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.534

<font> A. <$$font> I really did not hear that .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.535

<font> Q. <$$font> After the Enemy were put to Flight , did not the
<font> Lenox <$$font> wear under the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Stern ,
hawl up to Leeward , spring her Luff , and hawl out upon the Weather-Bow
? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.536

<font> A. <$$font> I remember the <font> Lenox <$$font> passing to
Leeward of us , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.537

but did not much mind her after that . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.538

<font> Q. <$$font> After the Signal was made for chasing to Leeward ,
was not I obliged to send my Boat on Board the <font> Lenox <$$font>
with Orders , for Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> to go and pursue the
Enemy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.539

<font> A. <$$font> I remember the Admiral sent his Boat on Board , and
gave those Orders . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.540

<font> Q. <$$font> Might not Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> , if he had
directly obeyed that Signal for chasing to Leeward , when the Enemy was
put to Flight , have got into Action again , as close and as soon as the
<font> Strafford <$$font> did ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.541

<font> A. <$$font> I really do@ @n't know . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.542

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> When Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font> was sent
with them Orders to go down to engage the Ships , whether the same
Orders were not sent to every Capt. in the Fleet ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,31.543

<P_32>

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't remember at that Time ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,32.545

I know once they were , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,32.546

they might then , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,32.547

but I do@ @n't remember . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,32.548

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> During the Action , while the <font>
Spaniards <$$font> fought in a Line of Battle , if the <font> Lenox
<$$font> had continued a-stern of the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , opposed
to the <font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral's second , and the <font> Warwick
<$$font> , and <font> Canterbury <$$font> had closed the Line , and
engaged the two Ships of the Enemy opposed to them , would it not have
contributed greatly to the Defeat of the Enemy ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,32.549

<font> A. <$$font> Greatly indeed : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,32.550

I do@ @n't think any of them would have escaped us .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,32.551

<font> Here the Evidence for the Crown was closed . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,32.552

<font> Tuesday , January <$$font> 16th , 1749 .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,32.553

Captain <font> Holmes <$$font> 's Defence . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,32.554

<font> Captain <$$font> Holmes <font> presented , to the President of
the Court-Martial a Paper , which was read by the Judge Advocate as
follows . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,32.555

{COM:letter_omitted;_see_holmes-letters-1749}

<P_36>

<font> But before any Witnesses were examined , Capt. <$$font> Holmes
<font> produced a Letter to him from the Rear-Admiral , who being asked
if that was his Hand-writing , he said it was ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,36.558

and thereupon the Judge Advocate read it to the Court , as follows .
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,36.559

{COM:letter_omitted;_see_holmes-letters-1749}

<P_37>

Upon the Reading of this Letter Mr. <font> Knowles <$$font> addressed
himself to the Court , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,37.562

and altho' he confessed the Letter , yet he hoped the Court would not
look upon it as an Order of his : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,37.563

But the Court over-ruled his Objection . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,37.564

Then Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> proceeded to the Examination of his
Witnesses , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,37.565

and called <font> Lieutenant <$$font> Davis , <font> first Lieutenant of
the <$$font> Lenox , <font> quartered upon the upper Deck . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,37.566

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font> keep close
to the <font> Cornwal <$$font> during the whole Time the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> was in Action ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,37.567

<font> A. <$$font> Yes {COM:missing_period} HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,37.568

<P_38>

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the <font> Lenox <$$font> on the <font>
Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter before her Maintop-Mast was gone ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.570

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.571

<font> Court . <$$font> Did you see the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Maintop-Mast go over board ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.572

<font> A. <$$font> I saw it presently afterwards ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.573

and the People called off the Forecastle that the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> 's Maintop-Mast was gone . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.574

<font> Q. <$$font> In what Position was the <font> Lenox <$$font> from
the <font> Cornwal <$$font> at that Time ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.575

<font> A. <$$font> Right a-stern of her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.576

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did you hear me or any Body call to hoist
the Gib and Stay-sail , and shiver the Main-topsail to run to Leeward of
her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.577

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> called to me
himself to run up the Gib and Foretop-Mast Staysail ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.578

and the Gib was run up , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.579

but the Head of the Foretop-Mast Staysail was shot away ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.580

nor could we shiver the Maintop_Sail , the Larboard Yard-Arm being shot
away , as also the Braces , and Starboard Maintop Bowline {TEXT:Bowling}
. HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.581

<font> Q. <$$font> Do not you think the <font> Lenox <$$font> would
have been on board the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , if {TEXT:If} I had not
shot upon the Weather-Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.582

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , one having Head-way , and the other Stern-way
. HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.583

<font> Q. <$$font> Was not the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Foresail up
when I shot upon her Quarter , and most of her Topsails a-back , and her
Helm a Starboard when we passed under her Stern ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.584

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.585

<font> Q. <$$font> Were Seaman-like Endeavours used as soon as could be
, when the <font> Lenox <$$font> was upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Larboard-Quarter , to back a-stern of her again ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.586

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.587

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Were these Endeavours used before I
hailed the <font> Lenox <$$font> to back off again ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.588

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't tell . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,38.589

<P_39>

<font> Court . <$$font> Was you endeavouring to get a-stern when you
saw them Wave from the Admiral , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.591

and what did you then endeavour to do ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.592

<font> A. <$$font> We were then endeavouring ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.593

and was before I ever saw the Admiral Wave , or any body else .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.594

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Did not I , when you came on Board the
<font> Cornwal <$$font> , ask you particularly why the <font> Lenox
<$$font> behaved in such a manner , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.595

and did not I find great fault with her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.596

<font> A. <$$font> The Admiral told me he thought she engaged at too
great a Distance . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.597

<font> Q. <$$font> Did I not find fault with your being so long upon my
Weather-Quarter , and asked what was the meaning of your coming there ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.598

<font> A. <$$font> I believe you did , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.599

and to the best of my Remembrance , I told you we endeavoured to get
clear as soon as we could . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.600

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font> wear under
the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Stern as soon as she could ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.601

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.602

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font> bear down upon the
Enemy from that Time , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.603

and did she ever hawl up upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Bow
, after she passed her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.604

<font> A. <$$font> We bore down upon the Enemy ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.605

we never hawled up so as to get upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Weather-Bow again . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.606

<font> Q. <$$font> Were we not bearing down when Capt. <font> Taylor
<$$font> came on Board with Orders to do so ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.607

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , we were bearing down ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.608

and before the Boat came on Board there were Orders given for the Main
Buntlines , and Leechlines , and the Lee-Clue-Garnet of the Mainsail ,
to be let go again , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.609

but before they were let go , Orders were given for the keeping all fast
, upon seeing a Boat coming from the Admiral .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,39.610

<P_40>

<font> Court . <$$font> What do you mean by bearing down ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.612

did you go larger than the Enemy , or upon the same Parallel with them ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.613

<font> A. <$$font> Larger . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.614

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did we not soon after Capt. <font> Taylor
<$$font> went from the Ship again , let drop the Lee Clue Garnet of the
Mainsail , and hawl aft the Starboard Mainsheet , and bear away upon the
Enemy so as to open the Enemy's Van Ships upon your Weather-Bow ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.615

<font> A. <$$font> We let go the Lee Clue Garnet ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.616

and hawled aft the Mainsheet , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.617

and bore more away , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.618

but whether so as to let the Van come upon the Weather-Bow , I can@ @not
say . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.619

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Was not the Enemy going large ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.620

and how many Points from the Wind at that Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.621

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't believe they were above two Points from
the Wind at that Time . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.622

<font> Court . <$$font> How many Points were you from the Wind at that
Time ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.623

<font> A. <$$font> We were five I@ @'m sure , good .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.624

<font> Q. <$$font> How long did the <font> Lenox <$$font> continue to
bear down in that Manner ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.625

<font> A. <$$font> I really ca@ @n't say how long .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.626

<font> Q. <$$font> Can you tell no Time ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.627

<font> A. <$$font> We run down so as we had like to have been on Board
the <font> Warwick <$$font> , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.628

and then we hawled up again to get clear of the <font> Warwick <$$font>
, to shoot a-head of her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.629

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you then bear away again after you had cleared
the <font> Warwick ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.630

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.631

<font> Q. <$$font> How long after that was it before you engaged with
the Enemy , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.632

or did you engage afterwards ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.633

<font> A. <$$font> We engaged directly ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.634

as soon as ever we got our Guns clear of the <font> Warwick <$$font> ,
we engaged . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,40.635

<P_41>

<font> Q. <$$font> Was you engaged before ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.637

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.638

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> What Ship was you engaged with ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.639

<font> A. <$$font> I think it was the second Ship in the Rear .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.640

<font> Q. <$$font> Was this before Dark , or after ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.641

<font> A. <$$font> It was before Dark . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.642

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the <font> Warwick <$$font> engaged with any
Ships when you passed her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.643

<font> A. <$$font> She was engaged with the Rear of the Fleet , when we
passed by her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.644

<font> Q. <$$font> Where was the <font> Canterbury <$$font> then ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.645

<font> A. <$$font> She was shot a-head of us ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.646

I think she passed , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.647

but do@ @n't know where she was then . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.648

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did I not set all the Sail I could when we
run down to the Enemy , that you thought would draw , or be of any
Service ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.649

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.650

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Did not Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font>
ask the Advice of his Officers about bearing down ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.651

<font> A. <$$font> Not that I know of . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.652

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Was not both my Topsail Yards wounded , and
Maintop-Mast , when I then bore down to the Enemy ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.653

<font> A. <$$font> The Topsail Yards were ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.654

I can@ @not tell as to the Maintop-Mast , whether it was at that Time or
not . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.655

<font> Q. <$$font> Did I ever lay upon the <font> Strafford's <$$font>
Larboard-Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.656

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.657

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> As you engaged you say with one of the
Enemy's Ships before it was Dark , by what Accident , or by what Means
was it you quitted that Ship , and did not continue the Engagement with
her , till the Conflict had been decided one way or the other ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.658

<font> A. <$$font> We did not part with her ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.659

we kept engaged till it was after Night , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,41.660

and there were two more <P_42> than she that we were engaging , went
right before the Wind , which we followed , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.661

and raked them several Times , till about seven o'Clock ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.662

all three got up in a Line of Battle a-head , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.663

and engaged us for some Time , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.664

and then bore away again , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.665

and we came a-thwart the <font> Strafford <$$font> ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.666

and fired into her thro' a Mistake ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.667

but as soon as we found the Mistake out , we quitted her ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.668

and gave chase to the Enemy again . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.669

<font> Court . <$$font> Was it them {COM:sic} three Ships you chased ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.670

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , the three Ships we were before engaged with .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.672

<font> Q. <$$font> How long did you chase them afterwards ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.673

and when did you lose them ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.674

<font> A. <$$font> We followed them till nine o'Clock ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.675

and lost them : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.676

About nine o'Clock we were close in Shore , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.677

and had eleven Fathom Water , and then seven ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.678

the Man forward said he saw the Rut of the Shore , and the Ship would be
on Shore , upon which we hawled off . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.679

<font> Court . <$$font> Was there any other <font> English <$$font> Men
of War in Company , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.680

and what were they ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.681

<font> A. <$$font> We lost sight of all Ships , both Friends and Foes ,
at that Time . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.682

<font> Q. <$$font> For how long had you lost sight of them ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.683

did you see any <font> English <$$font> Men of War after seven o'Clock ,
or did you see the <font> Strafford ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.684

<font> A. <$$font> No , it was a dark Night .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.685

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> When you saw the Breakers of the Shore
, whereabouts was the Enemy's Ships ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.686

<font> A. <$$font> The Enemy's Ships were then a-head of us ; as near
as could be , or rather upon our Starboard-Bow .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.687

<font> Q. <$$font> What Distance ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,42.688

<P_43>

<font> A. <$$font> I believe not very far , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.690

but as it was quite Dark , I could see but a little way ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.691

and therefore could not be so good a Judge . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.692

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Had I any Pilot on Board ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.693

<font> A. <$$font> No , but the Man that called out then was sounding .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.694

<font> Court . <$$font> How many sick Men on Board ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.695

<font> A. <$$font> I believe eighty or ninety .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.696

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Do you think I did my Duty , to the best of
my Power , during the Action ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.697

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I think you did to the best of your Power .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.698

<font> Court . <$$font> To what Cause do you think it was owing , that
you ran up so near the <font> Cornwal ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.699

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Maintop-Mast being
shot away , her Foresail up , and her Topsail down , that she had
Stern-way , and we had Head-way . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.700

<font> Q. <$$font> When you passed to Leeward of the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> , did you engage any Ship at that Time ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.701

and do you know what Ship or Ships they were ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.702

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , we engaged with the Rear of the Fleet ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.703

but which of them I can@ @not say . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.704

<font> Q. <$$font> What Distance was you from them ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.705

did their Shot reach you ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.706

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , their Shot went over us .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.707

<font> Q. <$$font> Was this when you was to Leeward of the Admiral ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.708

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.709

<font> Q. <$$font> At the Time you was a-head of the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> , was you then engaged , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.710

and was it with the same Ship , or any other ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.711

<font> A. <$$font> We were engaged , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.712

and I believe it was with the same Ships ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.713

it was with some of the Rear of the Fleet . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.714

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the Signal from the Admiral's Ship to
chase to Leeward ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,43.715

<P_44>

<font> A. <$$font> I did not see it , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.717

but I heard there was a Signal out ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.718

I was too busy in engaging the Enemy . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.719

<font> Q. <$$font> How near was you to the Enemy at the Time you heard
of the Signal being made ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.720

<font> A. <$$font> I believe we were within two Cables Length of the
Enemy . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.721

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know of Capt. <font> Taylor's <$$font>
coming on Board of you with a Message ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.722

<font> A. <$$font> I saw him along Side , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.723

but did not hear him deliver any Message . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.724

<font> Q. <$$font> Did the <font> Lenox <$$font> bear down after Capt.
<font> Taylor <$$font> came on Board , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.725

and how long did she do so ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.726

<font> A. <$$font> She bore down , but I can@ @not tell how long , till
we came foul of the <font> Warwick . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.727

<font> Q. <$$font> How far was the <font> Warwick <$$font> from you at
this Time , when Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font> came on Board ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.728

<font> A. <$$font> Not far , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.729

but I ca@ @n't say the Distance . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.730

<font> Q. <$$font> Where ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.731

<font> A. <$$font> Upon our Lee Beam ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.732

we were going away larger than the <font> Warwick <$$font> ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.733

the <font> Warwick <$$font> was in a Line of Battle with the Enemy .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.734

<font> Q. <$$font> How soon after the Time of Capt. <font> Taylor
<$$font> 's coming on Board , had you like to have run on Board of her ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.735

<font> A. <$$font> A very little Time . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.736

<font> Q. <$$font> What do you call a little Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.737

<font> A. <$$font> A few Minutes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.738

<font> Q. <$$font> How long did you fire into the <font> Strafford ?
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.739

<font> A. <$$font> I believe we did not fire above six or seven Shot
into her , if so many ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.740

we were so near that we hailed her , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.741

and upon discovering the Mistake we immediately stopt firing .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.742

<font> Q. <$$font> Was it then Dark ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.743

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.744

<font> Q. <$$font> By what Circumstances did you come to find out that
it was the <font> Strafford ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,44.745

<P_45>

<font> A. <$$font> By her hailing . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.747

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you know it by no other Circumstance but that of
her hailing ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.748

<font> A. <$$font> , I did not see , nor distinguish her Signal Lights
. HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.749

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see her Colours ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.750

<font> A. <$$font> No , it was Dark . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.751

<font> Q. <$$font> What Orders were given to discontinue the Fire upon
her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.752

<font> A. <$$font> I was sent down off the Quarter-Deck to all the
Officers , to tell them not to fire , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.753

for it was the <font> Strafford <$$font> , and not the Enemy .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.754

<font> Q. <$$font> Were these Orders immediately obeyed , or in how
long time before you ceased ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.755

<font> A. <$$font> Directly . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.756

<font> Q. <$$font> Were any Ships of the Enemy near you at that Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.757

<font> A. <$$font> We had been engaging the Enemy at that Time ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.758

the <font> Strafford <$$font> came athwart us ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.759

I know not which way she came . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.760

<font> Q. <$$font> When Orders were given to cease firing upon the
<font> Strafford <$$font> , did you continue to fire upon those Ships ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.761

<font> A. <$$font> We gave chase to the Ships again ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.762

and presently afterwards fired at them again .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.763

<font> Q. <$$font> When you pursued the Enemy's three Ships so near the
Shore , that the Man at the Chains called out eleven and seven Fathom ,
and the Man forward calling that he saw the Rut of the Shore , which
occasioned your hawling off , and after that when you found your Mistake
, so as to the Depth of Water by sounding , what did the <font> Lenox
<$$font> do then ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.764

<font> A. <$$font> We hawled off : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.765

We lost sight of all the Enemy entirely at that Time .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.766

<font> Q. <$$font> What became of them three Ships of the Enemy ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.767

or did you ever see or hear of them afterwards ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,45.768

<P_46>

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , about ten o'clock we saw two Ships engaging to
Leeward of us , upon which Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> ordered the
Helm a-weather , and bore away directly for the firing ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.770

but before we came there , they ceased firing on both Sides ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.771

we could not see any of the distinguishing Lights from neither of the
Ships . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.772

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Could you discern the Ships , when you saw
the Flashes of the Guns ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.773

<font> A. <$$font> No , we could only see the Flashes of the Guns .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.774

<font> Court . <$$font> Did you at any Time quit a Ship that you was
engaged with , and might still have continued to have been engaged with
, to follow another ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.775

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say that we did :
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.776

After it was dark any Ship that came to us we engaged them .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.777

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you at any Time during the Course of the Action
engage within Musket-Shot ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.778

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , and in the Night we engaged within Pistol-Shot
, I am sure . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.779

<font> Q. <$$font> By what Circumstances do you prove that ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.780

<font> A. <$$font> We were so near one of the three Ships , that I
really thought , off our Main-Deck , that our Gib-boom was near their
Ensign Staff . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.781

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Was this before or after the Accident
of firing into the <font> Strafford ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.782

<font> A. <$$font> Before . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.783

<font> Q. <$$font> Was any other Ship near those three Sail of the
Enemy's besides yourself , at that Time ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.784

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , the <font> Strafford <$$font> , I believe ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.785

for we came athwart her presently afterwards ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.786

whether there was any more I can@ @not say . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.787

<font> Q. <$$font> In what Position was the <font> Strafford <$$font>
from your Ship when you fired into her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.788

<font> A. <$$font> She was upon our Starboard-Bow .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.789

<font> Q. <$$font> In what Position was the Enemy's three Sail of Ships
at that Time also ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,46.790

<P_47>

<font> A. <$$font> One of them was a-head of us , and the other wide
upon our Bow : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.792

I think so , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.793

but can@ @not positively say . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.794

<font> Q. <$$font> That Ship that was a-head of you , was she to
Windward or to Leeward of the <font> Strafford ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.795

<font> A. <$$font> To Leeward of the <font> Strafford . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.796

<font> Q. <$$font> You said that your Gib-boom was pretty near one of
the three <font> Spanish <$$font> Ships Ensign Staff ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.797

by what means did you afterwards get to Windward of the <font> Strafford
? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.798

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't tell where the <font> Strafford <$$font>
was at that Time . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.799

<font> Then he withdrew . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.800

<font> Lieutenant <$$font> Gordon , <font> second Lieutenant of the
<$$font> Lenox , <font> quartered upon the Gun-Deck . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.801

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font> keep close
to the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , while the <font> Cornwal <$$font> was
in Action ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.802

<font> A. <$$font> I did not see the <font> Cornwal <$$font> in the
Beginning of the Action , because I was below .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.803

<font> Q. <$$font> After we passed to Leeward of the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> , was not Orders sent to you not to fire the Guns below , but
when they would take Place , and when we were close along Side the Enemy
? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.804

<font> A. <$$font> I received Orders before the Action not to fire ,
but when we were very close , and also twice or thrice in the Action .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.805

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Where was the Necessity for receiving
these Orders during the Time of Action not to fire , but when you were
close , if you had then been close ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.806

<font> A. <$$font> When we were leading down to the Enemy twice or
thrice I imagined them to be cautionary Orders , for fear we should
fling away our Shot , as several of the Enemy's Ships were then upon our
Lee-Quarter . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,47.807

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did I not engage the Enemy much closer ,
after the <font> Cornwal <$$font> left off the Engagement , <P_48> both
before Sun-set , and after it was Dark , than we ever did while we were
in a Line a-stern of the <font> Cornwal ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.808

<font> A. <$$font> We engaged closer after Dark , than we did at any
Time during the whole Action . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.809

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Do you know any thing of the <font>
Cornwal's <$$font> Boat coming along Side of you after the Signal was
made to chase to Leeward ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.810

<font> A. <$$font> I know nothing about the Signal ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.811

but I know of the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Boat coming on board us .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.812

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you know what Orders she brought ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.813

<font> A. <$$font> I heard Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font> to this Effect
, that it was the Admiral's Orders to bear down and engage the Enemy ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.814

and there was Lieutenant <font> Troughear <$$font> looking out of one of
the Weather-Ports with me at this Time ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.815

and we observed to each other , upon Capt. <font> Taylor's <$$font>
delivering the Message , that the <font> Lenox <$$font> was then bearing
down , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.816

and we could just see the <font> Strafford <$$font> open to Windward of
us , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.817

and then Lieutenant <font> Troughear <$$font> said , what did he bring
these Orders to us ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.818

and I answer'd , he must not be angry with Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font>
, HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.819

for he must deliver the Admiral's Orders . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.820

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the Boat come from the <font> Cornwal ?
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.821

<font> A. <$$font> I did not . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.822

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the <font> Lenox <$$font> at that Time , when
Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font> came along Side , close engaged with the
Enemy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.823

<font> A. <$$font> We were about 1$$4 of a Mile further off then ever
we were during the Action . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.824

<font> Q. <$$font> Where was the <font> Conquistador <$$font> then ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.825

<font> A. <$$font> I really ca@ @n't tell . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.826

<font> Q. <$$font> What Ship of the Enemy's was it that you was firing
at ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.827

<font> A. <$$font> We were firing at three of the Rear ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,48.828

at that Time most of her after Guns could not readily <P_49> bear upon
the Enemy ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.829

as they were edging along we were obliged to Point them very forward .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.830

<font> Q. <$$font> Was not the <font> Conquistador <$$font> the next
Ship in the <font> Spanish <$$font> Line a-head of the <font> Spanish
<$$font> Vice-Admiral ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.831

<font> A. <$$font> I believe she was . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.832

<font> Q. <$$font> When the <font> Lenox <$$font> passed to Leeward of
the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , and went a-head under her Stern , did she
not naturally then become nearer the <font> Conquistador <$$font> than
any other Ship of the Enemy's ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.833

<font> A. <$$font> While we were upon the Admiral's Weather-Quarter ,
the Enemy Shot , I believe , a good way a-head .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.834

I know there was a disabled Ship <paren> I took it <$$paren> with the
Topsails on the Cap that came very close to us indeed .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.835

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you fire at that Ship ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.836

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.837

but upon a Recollection we stopt firing a little , because they said
that she had struck , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.838

but upon her giving us some Guns we found there was no such thing ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.839

and then fired at her again . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.840

<font> Q. <$$font> Was it before or after you shot by the <font>
Conquistador <$$font> that you fired at the Enemy's Stern-most Ships ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.841

<font> A. <$$font> Before . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.842

<font> Q. <$$font> If you had bore away round , then would you not have
come much nearer the Enemy's Sternmost Ships , and been sooner up with
them ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.843

<font> A. <$$font> I believe as we went <paren> I take it <$$paren> we
were engaged as soon as if we had bore away round ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.844

for they seemed to be a good way to Leeward .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.845

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did we ever spring a Luff , after we passed
under the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Stern , so as to hawl upon her
Weather Bow ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.846

<font> A. <$$font> Not as I remember . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,49.847

<P_50>

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the <font> Strafford <$$font> or <font> Tilbury
<$$font> firing or engaged when you saw them upon our Weather-Bow ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.849

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Strafford <$$font> I could just see ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.850

and the <font> Tilbury <$$font> I believe was engaging .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.851

<font> Q. <$$font> How long was it after Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font>
came on board before I came into close Action ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.852

<font> A. <$$font> Not very long , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.853

I can@ @not say the Time ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.854

we were edging away most of the Engagement , till it was quite Dark .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.855

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> When you got fairly into close Action
with one of the Enemy's Ships , what prevented your continuing in Action
till the Conflict was decided ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.856

<font> A. <$$font> We engaged the Enemy till they put right :
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.857

a-fore the Wind , we then followed them , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.858

sprung our Luff , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.859

and raked them with our Broadsides , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.860

and bore away again ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.861

and repeated in that Manner , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.862

so served the Enemy till they formed in a Line of Battle a-head ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.863

we then had the warmest Fire we had at any time in the Engagement ; very
warm indeed ! HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.864

<font> Q. <$$font> Was none of the other Ships of the Squadron near you
at that Time ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.865

<font> A. <$$font> As I was betwixt Decks , really I ca@ @n't say ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.866

I suppose they were . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.867

<font> Q. <$$font> Was this before or after Dark ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.868

<font> A. <$$font> After Dark . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.869

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you not see the <font> Canterbury <$$font>
engaged with the Enemy's Sternmost Ships before Dark ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.870

<font> A. <$$font> It was either the <font> Canterbury <$$font> , or
<font> Warwick <$$font> ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.871

I know I saw one of the Ships : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.872

I believe it was the <font> Canterbury . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.873

<font> Q. <$$font> What did the Enemy's Ships do after they had formed
a Line of Battle , and had engaged us some Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,50.874

<P_51>

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.876

for just before we left off firing , there was a general Complaint for
want of Shot , upon which I turned a great many of the Men to hand up
Shot . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.877

I might be busy about half an Hour in getting the People to get up Shot
, HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.878

and when I came I did not see the Enemy . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.879

<font> Court . <$$font> Do you know of having fired into the <font>
Strafford ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.880

<font> A. <$$font> No , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.881

I remember a little after Dark the Master came down to me , and said be
cautious how you fire , upon which I went up and was told upon Deck ,
one was the <font> Strafford <$$font> , the other the Enemy ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.882

and I went down immediately again . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.883

<font> Q. <$$font> Was you commanding Officer upon the Gun-Deck ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.884

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.885

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you receive the Orders to cease firing upon the
<font> Strafford . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.886

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.887

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Was it not a very dark Night , till about
eleven o'Clock ; till the Moon rose ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.888

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.889

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember the Day I first saw the seven Sail
of <font> Spanish <$$font> Men of War , and they chasing us ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.890

what did I say to my People seeing the Frigate fire on the Convoy ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.891

<font> A. <$$font> The Captain called the Hands aft ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.892

the punctual Words I ca@ @n't remember ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.893

but said Words to this Purpose , that he would put the Ship in the Stays
; that he would tack on the Enemy , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.894

for he was determined to save as many of the Convoy as he could ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.895

and hoped they would all behave like <font> English <$$font> Men .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.896

Accordingly we tacked , or wore , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.897

and formed into a Line with two or three of the prime sailing Merchant
Ships , while the rest of the Convoy went away .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,51.898

When we bore from the <font> Spanish <$$font> Fleet Capt. <font> Holmes
<$$font> told me he was in hopes to have led the <P_52> Enemy down to
Admiral <font> Knowles <$$font> , who was then cruising on <font>
Tortuga <$$font> Bank . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.899

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you think during the Action I behaved myself as
an Officer and a Seaman , and with due Regard for the good of his
Majesty's Service , and as a Person who had a just Regard for the honour
of the <font> British <$$font> Arms ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.900

<font> A. <$$font> By engaging the Enemy pretty near I believe Capt.
<font> Holmes <$$font> had a due Regard for the Honour of the <font>
British <$$font> Arms , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.901

but as I was not upon Deck but a little while , can@ @not be a Judge of
his personal Bravery , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.902

but during the little time I was there , I heard him very anxious for it
. HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.903

<font> Court . <$$font> Did you ever hear any thing to the contrary ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.904

<font> A. <$$font> No , never , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.905

but all the Officers after the Action , the next Day , seemed to speak
in great Praise of Capt. <font> Holmes . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.906

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> During the Action that the <font>
Spaniards <$$font> fought in the Line of Battle , if the <font> Lenox
<$$font> had continued a-stern of the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , opposed
to the <font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral's second , and the <font> Warwick
<$$font> and <font> Canterbury <$$font> had closed the Line , and
engaged with those two of the Ships of the Enemy opposed to them , would
it not have contributed greatly to the Defeat of the Enemy ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.907

<font> A. <$$font> No doubt it would . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.908

<font> Q. <$$font> What prevented the <font> Lenox's <$$font> timely
backing of her Sails before she shot up upon the <font> Cornwal's
<$$font> Weather-Quarter , in order to preserve her Station ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.909

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.910

I was below . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.911

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Had you ever any Orders from me ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.912

or were there ever any Guns got out of the Stern to fire at the Enemy ,
the Day of Action ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.913

<font> A. <$$font> None the Day of Action . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.914

<font> Court . <$$font> Was you at any Time engaged within Musket-shot
during the Action ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,52.915

<P_53>

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , within half Musket-shot at Dark , when we were
close along side of the three Sail of <font> Spanish <$$font> Men of War
. HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.917

<font> Q. <$$font> Could you not have come up with those three Ships
that went from you before the Wind , if your Ship had not been yaw'd to
give them her Broadside ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.918

<font> A. <$$font> We came up with them several Times ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.919

then we sprung our Luff , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.920

and came upon their Stern : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.921

We always came up with them . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.922

I imagine our Raking obliged them to fall into a Line .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.923

<font> Q. <$$font> When you came upon Deck and saw the <font> Strafford
<$$font> , by what Marks did you know that it was the <font> Strafford ?
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.924

<font> A. <$$font> I did not know she was the <font> Strafford <$$font>
, no otherwise than I was informed , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.925

for it was so dark I could not distinguish any Marks ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.926

but was told one was the <font> Strafford <$$font> , the other the Enemy
. HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.927

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> How many Sail of <font> Spanish
<$$font> Ships were there in all , in the whole Line ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.928

<font> A. <$$font> There were six Ships in the Line , besides the small
one , a Frigate . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.929

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not the <font> Tilbury <$$font> and <font>
Oxford <$$font> engage one ; the <font> Spanish <$$font> Rear Admiral ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.930

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.931

<font> Q. <$$font> Was not the <font> Conquistador <$$font> taken
before Dark ; or about Dark ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.932

<font> A. <$$font> I saw the <font> Cornwal <$$font> close to her about
Dark , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.933

the Sun was just going down . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.934

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not one of the Enemy's Ships separate and bear
down as it were to the Assistance of the <font> Conquistador ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.935

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.936

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not the <font> Strafford <$$font> engage the
<font> Spanish <$$font> Vice-Admiral in the Evening ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.937

<font> A. <$$font> I fancy she did , being a head of us ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.938

but did not see her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,53.939

<P_54>

<font> Q. <$$font> Was the <font> Spanish <$$font> Vice-Admiral one of
those three Ships that bore away to Leeward ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.941

<font> A. <$$font> I thought so , and all aboard ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.942

but did not see the Flag . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.943

<font> Q. <$$font> Did any other of our Ships bear away with you after
these Ships , when you bore down to these three <font> Spanish <$$font>
Ships ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.944

<font> A. <$$font> I apprehend they did , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.945

but did not see them . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.946

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not the <font> Galga <$$font> Frigate make the
best of her way off in the Evening , when the Enemy first run {COM:sic}
? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.947

<font> A. <$$font> I believe she did , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.948

for I presently lost sight of her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.949

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the <font> Canterbury <$$font> engaged
with any of the Sternmost Ships , or any of the Enemy's Ships ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.950

<font> A. <$$font> I told the Court before I thought I saw her ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.951

and I believe it was the <font> Canterbury <$$font> engaging ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.952

but never saw her after Dark . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.953

<font> Then he withdrew . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.954

<font> Mr. <$$font> Skeene , <font> quartered upon the upper Deck ,
third Lieutenant of the <$$font> Lenox . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.955

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font> keep close
to the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , as long as the <font> Cornwal <$$font>
was in Action ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.956

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.957

<font> Q. <$$font> How came the <font> Lenox <$$font> upon the <font>
Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.958

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't tell , being at my Quarters .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.959

<font> Q. <$$font> How long was I upon the Weather-Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.960

<font> A. <$$font> About a quarter of an Hour , to the best of my
Knowledge . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.961

<font> Q. <$$font> Was we any longer , do you think , than could be
prevented ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.962

<font> A. <$$font> Not as I know of . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,54.963

<P_55>

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> If the Sails had been timely backed ,
would not that have prevented the <font> Lenox <$$font> shooting up upon
the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter , do you think ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.965

<font> A. <$$font> As I was under the Half-Deck , and could not
possibly be a Judge at what Time they ought to be back'd , I will not
pretend to say . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.966

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you not drive the People from the Guns to back
the Topsail ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.967

<font> A. <$$font> When I heard a Call of our like to be aboard of the
<font> Cornwal <$$font> , I turned the Hands forward ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.968

and went with them myself , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.969

but when I came to look round for them , I found them all returned to
their Quarters , on which I went aft a second Time , and turned them all
forward to their Duty . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.970

<font> Court . <$$font> What Duty ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.971

<font> A. <$$font> To the trimming of the Sails for getting clear of
the <font> Cornwal . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.972

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the <font> Cornwal <$$font> then
yourself ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.973

<font> A. <$$font> When I first came forward , I saw the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> with the head of her Maintop-Mast gone ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.974

but did not stay three Minutes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.975

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Was you so near her then as to be in
Danger of being aboard of her , do you think ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.976

<font> A. <$$font> Half our Bowsprit was equal to her Stern . {TEXT:?}
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.977

<font> Q. <$$font> But how far off from the <font> Cornwal ? <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.978

<font> A. <$$font> Very near to us , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.979

half our Bowsprit shot in with the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Weather-Quarter . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.980

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> As soon as we had Room clear of the <font>
Cornwal <$$font> , did we not instantly wear , and bear down upon the
Enemy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.981

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.982

<font> Q. <$$font> Did I ever hawl up after we had passed to Leeward of
her , to get upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Bow ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.983

<font> A. <$$font> Not that I know of . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,55.984

<P_56>

<font> Q. <$$font> Did we not as soon as we could after that get into
close Action with the Enemy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.986

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.987

<font> Q. <$$font> Did we not engage the Enemy close both before the
Sun-set , and after it was Dark , till about nine o'Clock ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.988

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.989

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> During the Action , while the <font>
Spaniards <$$font> fought in a Line of Battle , if the <font> Lenox
<$$font> had continued a-stern of the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , and
opposed the <font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral's Second , and the <font>
Warwick <$$font> and <font> Canterbury <$$font> had closed the Line ,
and engaged the two Ships of the Enemy opposite to them , would it not
have contributed greatly to the Defeat of the Enemy ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.990

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.991

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you think that there was any thing to hinder
those two Ships from being in their proper Stations ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.992

<font> A. <$$font> The <font> Warwick <$$font> could not come up the
first of the Engagement ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.993

I know nothing of any of the other . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.994

<font> Q. <$$font> What Reason was there : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.995

Did she make all the Sail she could ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.996

<font> A. <$$font> I saw her once with all the Sail she could set .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.997

<font> Q. <$$font> Could she not have set her Studding_Sails ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.998

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't say that : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.999

We were going away large . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.1000

<font> Court . <$$font> Do you know that your Ship fired into the
<font> Strafford ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.1001

<font> A. <$$font> I do not . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.1002

<font> And then he withdrew . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,56.1003

<P_57>

<font> Lieutenant <$$font> Wilkie , <font> then a Midshipman on board
the <$$font> Lenox , <font> on the Quarter-Deck to pass the Word .
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1005

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font> keep close
to the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , as long as the <font> Cornwal <$$font>
continued in Action , and engage as close as the <font> Cornwal ?
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1006

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1007

<font> Q. <$$font> Was not the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Maintop-Mast
carried away , Foresail up , and Foretopsail a-back , before ever the
<font> Lenox <$$font> shot upon the Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1008

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not recollect the Position of the Sails ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1009

but the Head of her Maintop-Mast was gone . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1010

<font> Q. <$$font> As the <font> Lenox <$$font> drew up close to her ,
do you think these Orders were given to put the Helm a Weather , to go
to Leeward of her , before it was ordered a Lee to shoot upon her

<font> A. <$$font> To pass the Word . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1014

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Do not you believe the <font> Lenox <$$font>
would have been on Board of the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , if I had not
put her Helm-a-Lee ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1015

<font> A. <$$font> I believe she would . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1016

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you hear the <font> Cornwal <$$font> hail the
<font> Lenox ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1017

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't say I did . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1018

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> If the <font> Lenox <$$font> had been
so near the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , do@ @n't you think you could have
heard any body call to the <font> Lenox <$$font> with a speaking Trumpet
? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1019

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , to be sure I could .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1020

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Do you think the firing of Guns of the Ships
engaging would have prevented your hearing the speaking Trumpet ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1021

or did you mean if the Ships were not engaging ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1022

<font> A. <$$font> I think the Guns would be a great Detriment to
hearing . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,57.1023

<P_58>

<font> Court . <$$font> Do you remember how long the <font> Lenox
<$$font> was upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1025

<font> A. <$$font> No longer than we could possibly back clear of her .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1026

<font> Q. <$$font> Have you no Notion of the Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1027

<font> A. <$$font> I believe it might be ten or twelve Minutes .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1028

<font> Q. <$$font> Was you upon the Deck all the Time , and what part
of the Deck ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1029

<font> A. <$$font> I was upon Deck all the Time we were upon the <font>
Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter ; sometimes upon the Main-Deck , and
sometimes upon the Quarter-Deck . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1030

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Did you hear Capt. <font> Holmes
<$$font> from the Lee Gangway call to me ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1031

<font> A. <$$font> I did not . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1032

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Do you remember what hindered me from

<font> A. <$$font> The Weather Maintopsail-Yard-Arm being shot away ,
and the Lee Maintopsail Bowline {TEXT:Bowling} .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1034

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Were there no preventer Braces to the
Main-Yard , and to the Maintopsail-Yard ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1035

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't recollect whether there were or not .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1036

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did we not hawl our Foresail up , and back
our Foretopsail ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1037

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1038

<font> Q. <$$font> Did we not set our Foresail again , as soon as we
had room to ware under the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Stern ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1039

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1040

<font> Q. <$$font> After we passed to Leeward of the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> , did we spring our Luff before we had like to have been on
board the <font> Warwick ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1041

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1042

<font> Q. <$$font> Did we not before it was Night , and after it was
Night , engage much closer than we did when we were in a Line of Battle
with the Enemy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1043

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1044

<font> Court . <$$font> Did the <font> Lenox <$$font> fire into the
<font> Strafford ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,58.1045

<P_59>

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't recollect any thing about that .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1047

<font> Q. <$$font> You say you was upon Deck all the while ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1048

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , but I did not know of it ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1049

but I heard of it . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1050

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you at any time engage within Musket-shot ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1051

<font> A. <$$font> By Appearance we engaged as {TEXT:at} close as any
Ship could be , without being aboard of one another ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1052

but I can@ @not say as to that , because I saw no Musket-shot come on
board . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1053

<font> Q. <$$font> Did the Enemy fire Musketry at you ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1054

and did you fire any at them ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1055

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't remember either one or the other .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1056

I know we had Marines on the Poop with fire_Arms ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1057

but whether they fired any I do@ @n't recollect .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1058

<font> Then he withdrew . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1059

<font> Lieutenant <$$font> Thredfall <font> of Marines , quartered upon
the Quarter-Deck . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1060

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font> engage the
Enemy in the Line as near as the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , or any other
Ship of our Squadron ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1061

<font> A. <$$font> I believe she did at the beginning of the Action .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1062

<font> Q. <$$font> What occasioned the <font> Lenox <$$font> to shoot
up upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1063

<font> A. <$$font> It was said on board that we should be on board of
her , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1064

so I believe she was shot up there to prevent it .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1065

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know whether the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Head of her Maintop-Mast was shot away before she was shot up there ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1066

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1067

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see any of the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Topsails a-back ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,59.1068

<P_60>

<font> A. <$$font> No , not that I remember ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1070

I did not take that Notice . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1071

<font> Q. <$$font> How long was we upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Weather-Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1072

<font> A. <$$font> Near 1$$4 of an Hour , I believe ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1073

we got off as soon as we could . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1074

<font> Q. <$$font> After we were clear of the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Weather-Quarter , did we not go under her Stern , pass to Leeward of her
, and run down to the Enemy till we had like to have been on board the
<font> Warwick ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1075

<font> A. <$$font> We backed off HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1076

and went a-stern of her , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1077

and then we shot up betwixt the <font> Cornwal <$$font> and the Enemy :
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1078

We Luffed up to the <font> Warwick <$$font> ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1079

but I am not quite positive whether it was then or not ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1080

but I believe it was . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1081

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Did not Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font>
take the Advice of his Officers about bearing down to the Enemy , after
the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Maintop-Mast was shot away ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1082

<font> A. <$$font> He was advised to the three Ships that were all in a
heap together , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1083

but he said I ca@ @n't do that ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1084

I must stick to the <font> Spanish <$$font> Admiral , which I take to be
the Body of their Fleet : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1085

I remember that very well . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1086

<font> Court . <$$font> Was this Advice and Reply given before or after
you were upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1087

<font> A. <$$font> I am pretty sure it was before .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1088

<font> Court . <$$font> Do you remember whether the <font> Cornwal's
<$$font> Maintop-Mast was gone before or after you run upon her Weather
, or while you was there ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1089

<font> A. <$$font> I really believe it was afterwards ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1090

but I am not sure whether it was , or not . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1091

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Was we not in closer Action before Sun-set ,
and after it was Dark , than when we were in the Line of Battle ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,60.1092

<P_61>

<font> A. <$$font> We engaged with small Arms three times ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1094

the last Time we were nearer than the first , and the second time very
near ; once while in the Line , second time about Sun-set , and the
third about eight o'Clock . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1095

<font> Q. <$$font> After the last Time of engaging with small Arms ,
was there not a Shot come in through the Side of the Forepart of the
Quarter-Deck , wounded two Men very much , and some of the Splinters
knocked me down , wounded you at the same Time , and dismounted a Gun on
the opposite Side of the Quarter-Deck , and at what Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1096

<font> A. <$$font> I remember the shot coming in very well , knocking
Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> down , and knocking me down , and
dismounting a Gun , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1097

but do@ @n't remember any thing of the two Men being wounded :
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1098

I believe it was about eight o'Clock . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1099

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember the Day I saw the seven Sail of
<font> Spanish <$$font> Men of War , what I said to my People , seeing
their Frigate firing on my Convoy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1100

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't remember any particular Thing ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1101

a great deal of Discourse happened . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1102

I remember you said you was in hopes of meeting with Mr. <font> Knowles
<$$font> , and that he would be a Match for them ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1103

and upon some Passengers advising you to bear away , you bid them hold
their Tongues , and say nothing about it , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1104

for you had a great deal of Money on Board .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1105

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you think during the Action I behaved myself like
an Officer , and as a Person who had a just Regard for the Honour of the
<font> British <$$font> Arms ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1106

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't pretend to be a Judge of an Officer of a
Ship , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1107

but I did not see but what Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> did his
Endeavour , as far as I could perceive . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,61.1108

<P_62>

<font> Court . <$$font> At that Time the Advice was given to Capt.
<font> Holmes <$$font> to bear down after those three Ships of the Enemy
, was the <font> Lenox <$$font> then engaged ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1110

<font> A. <$$font> I believe not . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1111

<font> Q. <$$font> How soon afterwards did she engage ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1112

<font> Q. <$$font> It might be ten or fifteen Minutes ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1113

we were then making Sail in order to get up to the Enemy .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1114

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see , or do you know of any Signal being
made to chase to Leeward ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1115

<font> A. <$$font> I did not see it , nor know of it ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1116

after we begun to engage , I did not mind any Signal .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1117

<font> Q. <$$font> What Number of Men with small Arms had you under
your Command ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1118

<font> A. <$$font> I had thirteen Marines , and I believe eight or ten
Passengers , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1119

but whether or no any of them were quartered to the great Guns , at the
beginning , I do@ @n't remember . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1120

<font> Q. <$$font> Did not the Enemy's small Shot at any Time reach
your Ship ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1121

<font> A. <$$font> We had one Marine shot in the Calf of the Leg :
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1122

I always took it to be with a small Shot ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1123

it was a Ball . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1124

I think it was about the time the Admiral's Maintop-Mast was shot away ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1125

but I am not certain of the time . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1126

<font> Q. <$$font> Was any of our Ships engaged with those three Ships
of the Enemy's when Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> was advised to bear
down to them ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1127

<font> A. <$$font> I believe not , except the <font> Warwick <$$font>
was ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1128

she was a-stern , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1129

and was firing , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1130

but I can@ @not say at what . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1131

<font> Q. <$$font> She was a-stern you say ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1132

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , rather upon our Quarter .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1133

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know any thing of firing into the <font>
Strafford ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1134

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1135

<font> Q. <$$font> Where was you ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,62.1136

<P_63>

<font> A. <$$font> Upon the Quarter-Deck . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1138

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know how you came to fire into her ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1139

<font> A. <$$font> No , but I know as soon as we knew it was the <font>
Strafford <$$font> , Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> sent me down to tell
them to cease firing , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1140

for it was the <font> Strafford . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1141

<font> Q. <$$font> To whom did you give these Orders ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1142

<font> A. <$$font> To Mr. <font> Davis . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1143

<font> Q. <$$font> How soon do you think they were obeyed ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1144

<font> A. <$$font> Instantly ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1145

they seemed to be in a Passion with me , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1146

for there had been Orders given before . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1147

<font> Q. <$$font> How did you know it was the <font> Strafford ?
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1148

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't tell how I came to know it ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1149

but I imagined it to be her , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1150

and told Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> it was the <font> Strafford .
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1151

<font> Q. <$$font> What Time of Night was it ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1152

<font> A. <$$font> I believe about half an Hour past seven , betwixt
seven and eight , to the best of my Remembrance .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1153

<font> Q. <$$font> Was it a dark Night , or a light Night ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1154

<font> A. <$$font> Neither ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1155

it was moderate . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1156

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see any distinguishing Light on board the
<font> Strafford ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1157

<font> A. <$$font> I know we were sorry we could not see them ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1158

but the Lights were placed in such a Manner , it was impossible for us
to see them ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1159

we were off the off-side of her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1160

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did we not engage them three Ships that were
coming up afterwards ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1161

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , we did . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1162

<font> Court . <$$font> How long did you fire into the <font> Strafford
<$$font> before you discovered it was her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1163

<font> A. <$$font> We might fire about fifteen or twenty Guns , but not
upon the Quarter-Deck , I supposing it to be the <font> Strafford .
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1164

<font> And then he withdrew . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,63.1165

<P_64>

<font> Wednesday , January <$$font> 17 . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1167

<font> Mr. <$$font> Birke , <font> quartered at the Braces , Mate of
the <$$font> Lenox . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1168

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font> keep close
to the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , and as close to the Enemy , except the
little time she was upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1169

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1170

<font> Q. <$$font> How came the <font> Lenox <$$font> upon the <font>
Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1171

<font> A. <$$font> The Head of the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Maintop-Mast was gone , her Foresail hawled up , her Topsail close down
, or upon the Cap , by which she had Stern-way ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1172

and in my Opinion we were endeavouring to run betwixt our Admiral and
the Enemy , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1173

but could not wear , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1174

so for fear of being on board of him , we luffed up .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1175

<font> Court . <$$font> How do you know you were endeavouring to wear ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1176

<font> A. <$$font> Why , we were endeavouring to shiver the Maintopsail
, HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1177

but could not ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1178

we hoisted the Jibs , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1179

and I heard the Capt. cry , <font> hard-a-weather . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1180

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> How long were we upon the <font> Cornwal's
<$$font> Weather-Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1181

<font> A. <$$font> About eight or ten Minutes at farthest , in my
Opinion . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1182

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you observe her having shot upon the <font>
Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter when she first came there ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1183

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1184

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> You have said the <font> Lenox <$$font>
was so near the <font> Cornwal <$$font> that you was afraid of being on
board of her , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1185

was she not so near that you could hear with a speaking Trumpet ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1186

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , if there were no Guns firing , nor no Noise
made , to be sure . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,64.1187

<P_65>

<font> Q. <$$font> What Sail had the <font> Lenox <$$font> out when she
shot upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1189

<font> A. <$$font> We had our Topsails and Mizen hawled out ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1190

and I believe we were hawling up the Fore-sail then .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1191

<font> Q. <$$font> You have said you sprung your Luff for fear of being
on board her , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1192

could not the <font> Lenox <$$font> have easier gone to Windward of the
<font> Cornwal <$$font> , and have gone up a-head of her , than wearing
under her Stern , at the time you put your Helm a Lee to prevent your
being on board her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1193

<font> A. <$$font> I believe we could , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1194

but there was some body upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Poop a waving
, as if we were to go Leeward . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1195

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Were Seamen-like Endeavours used to clear
the <font> Lenox <$$font> from the <font> Cornwal <$$font> as soon as we
could ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1196

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1197

<font> Q. <$$font> Did we not as soon as we were under the <font>
Cornwal's <$$font> Stern keep bearing down to the Enemy ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1198

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1199

<font> Q. <$$font> Did I ever spring my Luff , till I had like to have
been on board the <font> Warwick ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1200

<font> A. <$$font> No , not after we were upon the <font> Cornwal's
<$$font> Weather-Quarter we never did , till we had like to have been on
board the <font> Warwick . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1201

<font> Q. <$$font> Was I not bearing down when that Boat came , and
before that Boat came ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1204

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1205

<font> Q. <$$font> Did I not hawl aft my Starboard Main-sheet , soon
after that Boat had been along side of me , and bear away ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1206

<font> A. <$$font> You ordered the Mainsail to be let fall before that
Boat came on Board , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,65.1207

and being told <P_66> that the Boat was coming on Board , the Captain
ordered to stand fast the Mainsail till the Admiral's Boat came on Board
; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1208

immediately after she came along side of you , you hawled aft the
Starboard Mainsheet , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1209

and edged more away . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1210

<font> Q. <$$font> As soon as we were clear of the <font> Warwick
<$$font> , did I not edge away again a little , and engage the Enemy ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1211

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , immediately . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1212

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Was the <font> Warwick <$$font> then

<font> A. <$$font> I believe she was . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1214

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did not the <font> Lenox <$$font> some time

<font> Court . <$$font> What do you call close ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1217

<font> A. <$$font> I call half Musket-shot close .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1218

<font> Q. <$$font> What reason have you to think you was within half
Musket-shot ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1219

<font> A. <$$font> We being so very close to them .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1220

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know of any Musket-Ball coming on Board , or
any Body being wounded by Musket Ball ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1221

HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1223

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> What sort of a Night was it ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1224

<font> A. <$$font> A very dark Night , till about eleven o'Clock .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1225

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you think our firing into the <font> Strafford
<$$font> was owing to the Darkness of the Night , or taking her for one
of the Enemy's Ships , or what Accident ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1226

<font> A. <$$font> I certainly believe owing to the Darkness of the
Night , and taking her to be one of the Enemy's Ships .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1227

<font> Q. <$$font> Was not our Foretopsail shot to Pieces and when ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,66.1228

<P_67>

HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1230

about six or seven o'Clock it was shot , so that it was all to Pieces ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1231

we were obliged to bend another next Morning .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1232

<font> Court . <$$font> Why could you not shiver your Maintopsail ,
when you was upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1233

<font> A. <$$font> We had eight or ten Foot of our Larboard Maintopsail
Yard-Arm shot away , and likewise our Lee Maintop Bowline {TEXT:Bowling}
. HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1234

<font> Q. <$$font> By what Means did you afterwards fall a-stern of the
<font> Cornwal <$$font> , so as to go under her Lee Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1235

<font> A. <$$font> We clapt all a-back , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1236

and as soon as we had room we hoisted our Jib ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1237

and the Captain ordered the Foretop-Mast Staysail to be hoisted ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1238

but the Head of it was shot away . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1239

<font> Q. <$$font> If you could not shiver your Maintopsail to prevent
your going upon the Weather-Quarter , how came you to back it to fall
a-stern ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1240

<font> A. <$$font> As we Luft up , the Sail certainly shook ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1241

and then when we Luft up , we bent our Maintop Studdingsail-Halliards to
serve as a sort of Maintopsail-Brace . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1242

<font> Q. <$$font> Had you no preventer Braces ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1243

<font> A. <$$font> I believe we had at the lower Yards ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1244

but do@ @n't know whether we had at Topsail-Yards or not ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1245

but I believe not , because if we had we should certainly have made use
of them . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1246

<font> Q. <$$font> When you passed to Leeward of the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> , and you say you bore away , did you bear away as much as the
Enemy did ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1247

<font> A. <$$font> I can@ @not say whether we did or not ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1248

but we came along Side HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1249

and engaged them ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1250

we could just see their Van upon our Larboard-Bow .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1251

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you engage them as you were bearing away ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,67.1252

HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1256

we were not so close then as we were afterwards .

<font> Q. <$$font> How long was the Mainsail kept down , after he went
away <font> ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1258

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't know how long ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1259

but it was kept down till we came very close to the Enemy .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1260

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the Signal for chasing on board the
Admiral ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1261

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see a blue Flag at the Mizen Peak ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1264

<font> A. <$$font> I believe it was in the Mizen Shrouds ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1265

I saw it there . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1266

<font> Q. <$$font> Was her Mainsail set at that Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1269

<font> A. <$$font> I believe it was ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1270

we were pretty nigh , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1271

and upon seeing the blew Flag we bore more down to the Enemy ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1272

the Enemy I think was edging away a little .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1273

<font> Q. <$$font> At what o'Clock was it when you fired upon the
<font> Strafford ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1274

<font> A. <$$font> I am not positive whether we fired into the <font>
Strafford <$$font> or not , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1275

but it was about seven o'Clock when they said do not fire into that Ship
, HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1276

it is the <font> Strafford . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,68.1277

<P_69>

<font> A. <$$font> They were going away , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,69.1286

and we were going after them , firing at them too .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,69.1287

<font> Q. <$$font> Had the <font> Strafford <$$font> , the Ship you
were firing into , any distinguishing Lights out when you stopt firing
at her ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,69.1288

<font> A. <$$font> No , to be sure , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,69.1289

or else I would not have fired into her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,69.1290

and did we not endeavour to wear the <font> Lenox <$$font> to Leeward of
the <font> Cornwal <$$font> , before we shot upon her Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,71.1336

<font> A. <$$font> I saw some Gentlemen in the <font> Cornwal's
<$$font> Gallery , with@ @a Hat and a Trumpet , waving as I took it to
bear to Leeward . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,71.1337

I heard the Orders given to flat the Head-Sails , and hawl in the
Starboard-Braces , and to hoist the Foretop-Mast Staysail ;

the Head of the Foretop-Mast Staysail was shot away ,

HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,71.1340

the Lee Maintop-Bowline {TEXT:Maintop-Bowling} was shot away , by which
Means the after Sails flew forward , which threw the Ship up in the Wind
that she would not wear , or answer her Helm .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,71.1341

I then called to the Master , what was he about ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,71.1342

for he was going to disable both Ships , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,71.1343

and would run their Gib-Boom into the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Stern .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,71.1344

I likewise called that the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Head of the

Orders given to clap the Helm a Starboard to shake our Ship in the Wind

the Enemy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,72.1354

Cornwal <$$font> as we had room to wear , the Foresail was set , the Gib
hoisted , and the Foretop-Mast Staysail hoisted by a single Rope , which
I assisted the Boatswain to bend to the Bolt-Rope ,

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember a Boat coming from the <font>
Cornwal <$$font> to me ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,72.1361

<font> A. <$$font> I had the Starboard Clue-Garnet of the Mainsail in
my Hand . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,72.1362

There were Orders to hawl aft the Starboard Sheet of the Mainsail ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,72.1363

there was then directly Orders given to keep all fast , for that a Boat
was coming , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,72.1364

and I heard some of the Officers say , they believed the Admiral was
coming , upon which I made fast the Clue-Garnet , stept over to the
Larboard Side , and leaned over the Gunnel .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,72.1365

I heard a Gentleman in the Boat say , you must bear down upon the <font>
Spanish <$$font> Admiral , to the best of my Remembrance , upon which
the Mainsail was let fall , and the Starboard-Sheet hawled aft ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,72.1366

The People called out from the Top that the Foretop-Gallant-Yard was
shot in two , and the Larbord Yard-Arm <P_73> of the Foretopsail wounded
; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1368

we could set no more Sail that would do any Service , to my Sight .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1369

<font> Court . <$$font> Do you remember before the <font> Cornwal's
<$$font> Boat came on Board you , if you was going in a parallel Line
with the Enemy , or whether you were more to Windward , or more from the
Wind , than they were ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1370

<font> A. <$$font> We were going a great deal more from the Wind than
the Enemy , because to the best of my Remembrance we had two of the
Enemy's Van open upon our Larboard-Bow , and also three of our Ships .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1371

<font> Q. <$$font> Was you engaged at this Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1372

<font> A. <$$font> We did fire some Guns at the Enemy's Rearmost Ships
, as they were firing at us , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1373

but as to firing Broadsides we did not to my Remembrance .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1374

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did we come into close Action again before
Sun-set ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1375

<font> A. <$$font> After we had got clear of the <font> Warwick
<$$font> we were so close engaged , that shot of all Kinds fell about us
, as if Hail was coming down . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1376

<font> Court . <$$font> How came you so near the <font> Warwick ?
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1377

<font> A. <$$font> As the <font> Warwick <$$font> had a greater press
of Sail than us , and going in a Line with the Enemy , and engaging and
firing at that Time , I believe , to the best of my Knowledge , we were
obliged to Luff clear of her , by not having an equal press of Sail with
her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1378

<font> Q. <$$font> Did the <font> Warwick <$$font> go a-head of you ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1379

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1380

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember what became of the <font> Warwick ?
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1381

<font> A. <$$font> We then luffing more up felt the Weight of the Wind
better , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1382

and so shot a-head of her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1383

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> Do you know what became of her
afterwards ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,73.1384

<P_74>

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't remember that I afterwards saw the <font>
Warwick <$$font> , till I saw her going after a single Ship detached
from the <font> Spanish <$$font> Squadron . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1386

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> What sort of a Night was it ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1387

<font> A. <$$font> A moderate Night , but a very dark one , till
betwixt ten and eleven , to the best of my Remembrance .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1388

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you think our firing into the <font> Strafford
<$$font> was owing to the Darkness of the Night , or what Cause ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1389

<font> A. <$$font> The Night was very dark ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1390

and as we were smartly engaged with the Enemy , I remember a Ship coming
athwart our Hawse , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1391

and not knowing who she was , and seeing no Lights , I believe there
were some Guns fired into her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1392

<font> Court . <$$font> Can you recollect which way the <font>
Strafford <$$font> stood , which way was her Head ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1393

<font> A. <$$font> To the best of my Knowledge she had her Head
somewhere betwixt the West and the North , standing partly athwart of us
. HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1394

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> What did we do after that ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1395

<font> A. <$$font> We went a-stern of her , to the best of my Knowledge
, HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1396

and bore more away , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1397

and kept engaging the Enemy . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1398

<font> Court . <$$font> Did you know it was the <font> Strafford
<$$font> you fired into ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1399

<font> A. <$$font> I did not till I heard Orders from abaft to cease
firing , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1400

for it was the <font> Strafford . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1401

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> How long did we engage that Night ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1402

<font> A. <$$font> I think to the best of my Knowledge it was till
something past nine o'Clock . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1403

<font> Q. <$$font> Did we continue Action till that Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1404

<font> A. <$$font> Some Time about eight o'Clock , to the best of my
Remembrance , the Starboard Clue of the Foretopsail was shot away , and
her Foretopsail terribly shattered ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,74.1405

I heard the Men in the Top call out , that the Fore-Chain that slung the
Foreyard was shot , and her Foretopsail Ties were <P_75> shot , the
Enemy being at that Time at a greater Distance from us than they were at
any Time before that I saw them : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1406

We kept firing and chasing till we came so nigh the Shore , that the Man
at the Lead called out eleven and seven Fathom , and to the best of my
Knowledge , said he saw the Surf of the Shore , which put us in an
Uproar , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1407

and to my Knowledge , there was no firing at that Time , which I took to
be past nine o'Clock . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1408

<font> Court . <$$font> What did you do upon this Uproar in the Ship ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1409

<font> A. <$$font> I heard the Helm ordered a-Port ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1410

and made what we could of the Headsails , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1411

and wore her round . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1412

<font> Q. <$$font> How was the Enemy standing from you at that Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1413

<font> A. <$$font> At that Time I do@ @n't remember I saw any of the
Enemy , till we stood a little further off Shore ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1414

then we saw some Flashes of Fire ; upon which there were Orders to bear
to that Fire , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1415

in a short Time the Fire ceased ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1416

then we hawled more off Shore . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1417

<font> Q. <$$font> Had you lost sight of the Enemy before you thought
you saw the Rut of the Shore ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1418

<font> A. <$$font> Not as I remember before we were put in a Confusion
. HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1419

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> After we had left off the Engagement , did I
not set the People to Work to fit the Ship for Action again ; to
knotting and splicing the Rigging ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1420

<font> A. <$$font> I remember the Boatswain and I were very busy about
it , and especially in getting the Starboard Clue of the Foretopsail
stopped , and the Topsail-Sheet . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1421

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember the Day I saw the seven Sail of
<font> Spanish <$$font> Men of War , and they chasing us ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,75.1422

what did I say to my People upon my seeing <P_76> their Frigate firing
upon some of the Sternmost of my Convoy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1423

Adm. <font> Knowles <$$font> answers , <font> I admit you did every
thing in your Power , and behaved like a good Officer in saving the
Convoy , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1424

and the Consequence bespeaks it . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1425

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Do you think I endeavoured to do every thing
I could to annoy the Enemy during Action ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1426

<font> A. <$$font> I imagine myself to have been long enough at Sea to
be a Judge of it , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1427

and have been in several Actions , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1428

and I think that there was both Seaman-like , and as good Conduct , as
it was possible to use to annoy the Enemy . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1429

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you hear any Body in the Passage afterwards in
our Ship , ever say or whisper any thing to the contrary ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1430

<font> A. <$$font> In several Discourses in the Coach , where I messed
, it was the whole Opinion , that we had done Wonders , according as our
Ship was manned . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1431

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you then imagine the Conduct of the <font> Lenox
<$$font> would be called in question for that Day's Action ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1432

<font> A. <$$font> So far the Reverse , that when I even read it in the
publick Papers , I would not believe it , till I had Capt. <font>
Holmes <$$font> 's Letter . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1433

Adm. <font> Knowles . <$$font> What Time did the <font> Lenox <$$font>
first begin the Action , in the Afternoon , a-stern of the <font>
Cornwal ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1434

<font> A. <$$font> To the best of my Knowledge some little time before
three o'Clock . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1435

<font> Q. <$$font> As the <font> Lenox <$$font> had but fifty-six Guns
mounted , did she get any of her Guns over from her other Ports to that
Side she fought on ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1436

<font> A. <$$font> I do believe she did . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1437

<font> Q. <$$font> How many ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1438

<font> A. <$$font> Two I know of . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,76.1439

<P_77>

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember whether they were upper Deck , lower
Deck , or Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1441

<font> A. <$$font> I remember the After-Gun in the Gun-Room , and one
in the Cabbin . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1442

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Can you recollect whether there was not a
want of Shot before the Action ceased , and whether the <font> Spaniards
<$$font> which were then on board did not hand Shot up very briskly ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1443

<font> A. <$$font> This I recollect , that I myself along with
Lieutenant <font> Davis <$$font> , examined all the Shot-Lockers upon
the upper Deck , and round the Foremast , and tho' we had counted
twenty-five Shot in each Locker upon the upper Deck , yet there was none
to be found , nor Wads . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1444

Mr. <font> Davis <$$font> run to the Gunner with his Cutlash ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1445

and made a stroke at him ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1446

I caught him by the Hand HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1447

and said , Mr. <font> Davis <$$font> , are you going to murder the Man
, upon which Mr. <font> Davis <$$font> was making a second Stroke at
him , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1448

and I prevented that likewise . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1449

He ordered Mr. <font> Birk <$$font> the Mate to go into the Hold , and
stave some empty Casks to get to the Shot-Lockers ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1450

and abaft there were Orders for some People to go into the Magazine to
assist filling of Powder . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1451

Mr. <font> Egan <$$font> , a Gentleman Passenger , was one that went
down , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1452

got the Master of Arms@ @'s Coat to go down in , having lost his own ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1453

and I helpt him to put it on . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1454

The <font> Spaniards <$$font> continued so to do , till ten o'Clock in
the Evening that Night ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1455

there was <font> Junk <$$font> handed up , which we made Wads of , tho'
the Gunner had told me with his own Mouth , there were fifty rounds of
Wads before the Action begun . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1456

I asked the Cooper's-@ @Mate the next Day <paren> <font> Richard Junk
<$$font> by Name <$$paren> what Powder was expended ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1457

he told me there were one_hundred_and_sixteen empty Barrels in the
Magazine , of which there could not be above a_Dozen before the Action
began : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,77.1458

Likewise two more of the People told me , they believed <P_78> there
were one_hundred Barrels of Powder expended .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1459

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did I not bend another Topsail that Night ,
or the next Morning after the Action ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1460

<font> A. <$$font> Some Time betwixt twelve o'Clock and Day-light .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1461

<font> Then he withdrew . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1462

<font> Mr. <$$font> Bone , <font> a Midshipman quartered upon the Poop
. <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1463

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Was we not bearing down on the Enemy when
Capt. <font> Taylor <$$font> came along-side of me in a Boat from the
Admiral ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1464

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1465

<font> Q. <$$font> What did we do upon those Orders soon after ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1466

<font> A. <$$font> We let go the Starboard Clue-Garnet ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1467

and hawled aft the Main-Sheet . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1468

<font> Q. <$$font> Did we not engage closer before Sun-set , and after
it was Dark , than we did when we were in a Line of Battle ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1469

<font> A. <$$font> Much closer . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1470

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember any Grape-Shot , Lang-ridge , or
Musket-Ball , coming on board us during the Action ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1471

<font> A. <$$font> One Piece of Langridge I picked up ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1472

and Grape-Shot there were two or three came through the Mizen ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1473

Musket-Ball I remember none . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1474

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember whether we bent another Foretopsail
that Night , or next Morning ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1475

<font> A. <$$font> To the best of my Remembrance , we bent one next
Morning . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1476

<font> Court . <$$font> Was it before Daylight or after ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1477

<font> A. <$$font> Before Daylight . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1478

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Do you remember at the first of the Action ,
by what Accident we were upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Weather-Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,78.1479

<P_79>

<font> A. <$$font> By Reason of the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> having
her Maintop-Mast shot away , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1481

and her Mizentopsail I took at that Time to be a-back , she having
Stern-way {TEXT:Sternway} , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1482

and being very near her at the Time , we were obliged to Luff up to
prevent being on board of her . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1483

<font> Court . <$$font> Could you not have wore to have gone to Leeward
as well as Luff up to go to Windward ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1484

<font> A. <$$font> I believe we might . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1485

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know any Reason why you did not ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1486

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1487

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the Signal of a blue Flag from the
Admiral's Ship ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1488

<font> A. <$$font> No I did not . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1489

<font> Mr. <$$font> Egan , <font> a Passenger on board the <$$font>
Lenox . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1490

<font> Court . <$$font> Where was you ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1491

<font> A. <$$font> I was upon the upper Deck , the first Part of the
Action , but not the latter Part . {TEXT:?} HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1492

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did you see any of the <font> Cornwal's
<$$font> Topsails a-back before you went off the Quarter-Deck , and at
what Time ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1493

<font> A. <$$font> I saw her Mizentopsail aback ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1494

I believe it was not quite an Hour after the Action begun ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1495

it was just before you got upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font>
Weather-Quarter . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1496

<font> Q. <$$font> How long was the <font> Lenox <$$font> upon the
<font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1497

<font> A. <$$font> I ca@ @n't be exact as to the Time ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1498

I believe about ten or fifteen Minutes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1499

I saw our People very busy in trimming the Sails .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1500

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you ever see , or ever hear it whispered by the
Officers or Ships Crew , that during the Action I acted in any manner
that might sully my Character ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,79.1501

<P_80>

<font> A. <$$font> No , I never heard it mentioned by either Officers
or Seamen , that I ever heard talk of it , but that Capt. <font> Holmes
<$$font> behaved with the greatest Resolution a Man could do ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1503

and they said it would encourage a Man to fight under him .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1504

<font> Q. <$$font> As far as you could observe do you think that I did
my utmost , and that with Vigilance to annoy the Enemy ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1505

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , I think as far as a Land-Man can judge of this
Affair , that Capt. <font> Holmes <$$font> did his utmost to annoy the
Enemy , and to come at them as soon as he could .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1506

He stood upon the Quarter-Deck to give Orders ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1507

and ordered the Man at the Wheel not to bring the Ship up till she was
as near the Enemy , as the Headmost Ship the <font> Cornwal . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1508

<font> Q. <$$font> Tho' you were below , and by my Desire , did we not
continue firing till nine o'Clock , or thereabouts ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1509

<font> A. <$$font> We continued firing till about nine o'Clock .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1510

Thomas Pearson , <font> a Midshipman on board the <$$font> Lenox ,
<font> quartered upon the Quarter-Deck , the first Gun . <$$font>
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1511

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> What Distance was we from the <font> Cornwal
<$$font> when we came to Action ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1512

<font> A. <$$font> I believe not a Cables Length off .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1513

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember the <font> Lenox <$$font> being on
the <font> Cornwal <$$font> 's Weather-Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1514

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1515

<font> Q. <$$font> How long did she continue there ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1516

<font> A. <$$font> I believe about five Minutes was the outside .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1517

<font> Q. <$$font> What was the Reason of the <font> Lenox <$$font>
being upon the <font> Cornwal's <$$font> Weather-Quarter ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1518

<font> A. <$$font> I take it , the Reason was the <font> Cornwal's
<$$font> Foretopsail was upon the Cap , her Maintop-Mast shot away , and
I believe the Mizentopsail a-back , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,80.1519

<P_81>

and I believe the Ship had Stern-way , our Ship had Head-way , and for
that Reason we shot up upon her Quarter . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1521

I believe our Bowsprit might be as far as their Mizen Chains .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1522

<font> Q. <$$font> Did we not endeavour to get a-stern of the <font>
Cornwal <$$font> again as soon as we could ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1523

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , we did , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1524

but Part of our Maintopsail Yard-Arm was shot away ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1525

and our Maintop-Bowlines {TEXT:Maintop-Bowlings} were shot away ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1526

that was the Reason we could not spill the Sails to wear .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1527

<font> Q. <$$font> Did we not as soon as we had room clear of the
<font> Cornwal <$$font> , ware under her Stern , and keep bearing down
to the Enemy ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1528

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , we received our preventer Brace ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1529

and backed the Maintopsail , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1530

and wore directly as soon as the <font> Cornwal <$$font> was shot a-head
a little way . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1531

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember a Boat coming from the <font>
Cornwal ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1532

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1533

<font> Q. <$$font> Were we not bearing down when that Boat came along
Side ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1534

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , we were edging down then , at that Time .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1535

<font> Q. <$$font> Did I ever spring my Luff after we passed under the
<font> Cornwal's <$$font> Stern , till I had like to have been on board
the <font> Warwick . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1536

<font> A. <$$font> No , never till the <font> Warwick <$$font> came to
Leeward of us , and had like to have been on board of us ;
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1537

we were obliged to do it , or be on board of her .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1538

<font> Q. <$$font> Were we not afterwards engaged close before Sun-set
? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1539

<font> A. <$$font> I think the closest of our Engagement was about Dark
. HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1540

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you observe any Grape-Shot or Musket-Ball coming
on board us ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1541

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , there were both . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1542

<font> Court . <$$font> How do you know there were both ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,81.1543

<P_82>

<font> A. <$$font> Because I saw two Grape-Shot taken out of the
Quarter-Deck , that had lodged there : HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1545

I saw four or five Musket-Balls as they were sweeping the Quarter-Deck
next Day , that had been flattened by striking against the Ship's Side ,
so that I was certain they must come from the Enemy ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1546

for I picked them up myself . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1547

George Lester , <font> Midshipman , quartered the aftermost Gun but one
, upon the upper Gun-Deck . <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1548

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Do you remember any Grape-Shot sticking in
the Ship's Sides ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1549

<font> A. <$$font> Yes , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1550

and I saw the People that were quartered with me pick them out .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1551

<font> Lieutenant <$$font> Thomson , <font> first Lieutenant of the
<$$font> Strafford , <font> quartered upon the upper Gun-Deck .
<$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1552

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did you ever see the <font> Lenox <$$font> ,
after the <font> Cornwal <$$font> hawled out of the Line , and ceased to
engage , hawl upon the <font> Strafford's <$$font> Larboard Quarter .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1553

<font> A. <$$font> As I was quartered in the Waist , I could not see if
any Ship was on her Weather-Quarter or not .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1554

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember to have heard any murmuring amongst
the <font> Strafford's <$$font> People on Account of the <font> Lenox
<$$font> not coming down ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1555

<font> A. <$$font> No . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1556

<font> Q. <$$font> At that Time in what Position , and at what Distance
was the <font> Lenox <$$font> when she fired some Guns into the <font>
Strafford <$$font> , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1557

and how many Guns did she fire into her , do you think ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1558

<font> A. <$$font> When I first saw the <font> Lenox <$$font> she was
upon our Larboard-Bow , standing athwart our Fore-foot , and then firing
some Guns into us . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,82.1559

I was ordered by Capt. <font> Brodie <$$font> to take the speaking
Trumpet , go upon the Forecastle , and hail the <P_83> <font> Lenox
<$$font> , and tell them we were the <font> Strafford <$$font> , which I
did , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1560

and they ceased their Fire . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1561

<font> Court . <$$font> Was it Daylight , or Dark at that Time ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1562

<font> A. <$$font> It was Dark . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1563

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> After the <font> Lenox <$$font> was hailed ,
what became of her , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1564

or which way did she stand ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1565

<font> A. <$$font> As far as I could see her she stood athwart us down
towards the Enemy before the Wind ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1566

after hailing I went down to my Quarters . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1567

<font> Court . <$$font> Did you see any of the Enemy's Ships at that
Time , and how many ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1568

<font> A. <$$font> The Enemy , I am sure , were all to Leeward of us ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1569

for I do@ @n't remember to have seen any more than the Ship engaged with
us . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1570

<font> Q. <$$font> You was engaged at that Time ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1571

was you not ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1572

<font> A. <$$font> Yes . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1573

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you hoist any distinguishing Lights ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1574

and if you hoisted any , when was it ? HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1575

<font> A. <$$font> If they were hoisted , I do@ @n't remember to have
seen them ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1576

as I was quartered in the Waist I could not see the Lights upon the
Driver-Boom . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1577

<font> Prisoner . <$$font> Did you see any Ships engaged with the Enemy
when you left off , and were lying to , towards nine o'Clock ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1578

<font> A. <$$font> I remember Capt. <font> Innes <$$font> in the
<font> Warwick <$$font> came down and hailed us ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1579

and to the best of my Remembrance , he said he was going down to the
Assistance of some Ships engaged to Leeward of us .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1580

Capt. <font> Brodie <$$font> made Answer , that we were very much
shattered , but would follow him down ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1581

there were Ships engaging to Leeward at that Time .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,83.1582

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you think our firing into the <font> Strafford
<$$font> was owing to the Darkness of the Night , and <P_84> taking her
for an Enemy's Ship , in the warmth of the Engagement , or what Cause ?
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,84.1583

<font> A. <$$font> It is my Opinion so ; HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,84.1584

I can@ @not think any Man would be so base as to fire into a known
Friend . HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,84.1585

<font> Court . <$$font> How long time did the <font> Lenox <$$font>
fire into the <font> Strafford ? <$$font> HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,84.1586

<font> A. <$$font> I do@ @n't remember her having fired above six or
seven Shot to my Knowledge , HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,84.1587

and that could take but a very little Time .
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,84.1588

<font> Here Captain <$$font> Holmes <font> closed his Evidence ,
HOLMES-TRIAL-1749-1,84.1589

and then delivered into Court a Paper , containing a Summary of his Case
and Evidence , which was read by the Judge Advocate as follows .
