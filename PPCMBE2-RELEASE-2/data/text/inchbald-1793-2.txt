Act III . INCHBALD-1793-2,29.4

Scene I . INCHBALD-1793-2,29.5

<font> A Library at Lord <$$font> Norland <font> 's . <$$font>
INCHBALD-1793-2,29.6

<font> Enter Lord <$$font> Norland , <font> followed , by Mr. <$$font>
Harmony . INCHBALD-1793-2,29.7

<font> Lord <$$font> Norland , <font> in anger . <$$font> <$$heading> I
tell you , Mr. Harmony , that if an indifferent person , one on whom I
had never bestowed a favour in my life , were to offend me , it is in my
nature never to forgive . INCHBALD-1793-2,29.8

Can I then forgive my own daughter , my only child , on whom I heaped
continually marks of the most affectionate fondness ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,29.9

Shall she dare to offend me in the tenderest point , and you dare to
suppose I will pardon her ? INCHBALD-1793-2,29.10

<font> Har. <$$font> Your child , consider . INCHBALD-1793-2,29.11

<font> Lord N. <$$font> The weakest argument you can use .
INCHBALD-1793-2,29.12

- As my child , was not she most bound to obey me ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,29.13

As my child , ought she not to have sacrificed her own happiness to mine
? Instead of which , mine has been yielded up for a whim , a fancy , a
fancy to marry a beggar ; INCHBALD-1793-2,29.14

and as such is her choice , let her beg with him .
INCHBALD-1793-2,29.15

<font> Har. <$$font> She does by me ; INCHBALD-1793-2,29.16

- pleads hard for your forgiveness {TEXT:forgivenness} .
INCHBALD-1793-2,29.17

<font> Lord N. <$$font> If I thought she dared to send a message to me
, though dictated on her knees , she should find that she had not yet
felt the full force of my resentment . INCHBALD-1793-2,29.18

<font> Har. <$$font> What could you do more ? INCHBALD-1793-2,29.19

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I have done nothing yet .
INCHBALD-1793-2,29.20

At present , I have only abandoned her ; INCHBALD-1793-2,29.21

- but I can persecute . INCHBALD-1793-2,29.22

<font> Har. <$$font> I have no doubt of it : INCHBALD-1793-2,29.23

and , that I may not be the means of aggravating your displeasure , I
assure you , that what I have now said has been entirely from myself ,
without any desire of hers ; INCHBALD-1793-2,29.24

and , <P_30> at the same time , I give you my promise , I will never
presume to intrude the subject again . INCHBALD-1793-2,30.25

<font> Lord N. <$$font> On this condition , <paren> but on no other ,
<$$paren> I forgive you now . INCHBALD-1793-2,30.26

<font> Har. <$$font> And now then , my Lord , let us pass from those
who have forfeited your love , to those who possess it .
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.27

- I heard some time ago , but I never presumed to mention it to you ,
that you had adopted a young man as your son ? INCHBALD-1793-2,30.28

<font> Lord N <$$font> " A young man ! " INCHBALD-1793-2,30.29

Pshaw ! - No ; a boy - a mere child , who fell in my way by accident .
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.30

<font> Har. <$$font> A chance child ! INCHBALD-1793-2,30.31

Ho ! ho ! - I understand you . INCHBALD-1793-2,30.32

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Do not jest with me , Sir .
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.33

Do I look - INCHBALD-1793-2,30.34

<font> Har. <$$font> Yes , you look as if you would be ashamed to own
it , if you had one . INCHBALD-1793-2,30.35

<font> Lord N. <$$font> But this boy I am not ashamed of :
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.36

- he is a favourite - rather a favourite . INCHBALD-1793-2,30.37

- I did not like him so well at first ; INCHBALD-1793-2,30.38

- but custom , - and having a poor creature entirely at one's mercy ,
one begins to love it merely from the idea of - What would be its fate
if one did not ? INCHBALD-1793-2,30.39

<font> Har. <$$font> Is he an orphan then ? INCHBALD-1793-2,30.40

<font> Lord N. <$$font> No . INCHBALD-1793-2,30.41

<font> Har. <$$font> You have a friendship for his parents ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.42

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I never saw the father : INCHBALD-1793-2,30.43

his mother I had a friendship for once . <paren> <font> Sighing .
<$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,30.44

<font> Har. <$$font> Ay , while the husband was away ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.45

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I tell you , no . <font> <paren> <font>
violently . <$$font> <$$paren> - INCHBALD-1793-2,30.46

But ask no more questions . INCHBALD-1793-2,30.47

Who his parents are , is a secret , which neither he , nor any one
<paren> that is now living <$$paren> knows , except myself ; nor ever
shall . INCHBALD-1793-2,30.48

<font> Har. <$$font> Well , my Lord , since 't@ @is your pleasure to
consider him as your child , I sincerely wish you may experience more
duty from him than you have done from your daughter .
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.49

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Thank Heaven , his disposition is not in the
least like her's . INCHBALD-1793-2,30.50

- No : <paren> <font> very much impassioned . <$$font> <$$paren> I have
the joy to say , that never child was so unlike its mother .
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.51

<P_31>

<font> Har. <$$font> <paren> <font> starting . <$$font> <$$paren> How
! His mother ! INCHBALD-1793-2,31.53

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Confusion ! INCHBALD-1793-2,31.54

- what have I said ? INCHBALD-1793-2,31.55

I am ashamed - INCHBALD-1793-2,31.56

<font> Har. <$$font> No , - be proud . INCHBALD-1793-2,31.57

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Of what ? INCHBALD-1793-2,31.58

<font> Har. <$$font> That you have a lawful heir to all your riches ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,31.59

proud that you have a grandson . INCHBALD-1793-2,31.60

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I would have concealed it from all the world ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,31.61

I wished it even unknown to myself . INCHBALD-1793-2,31.62

And let me tell you , Sir , <paren> as not by my design , but through my
inadvertency , you are become acquainted with this secret , <$$paren>
that , if ever you breathe it to a single creature , the boy shall
answer for it ; INCHBALD-1793-2,31.63

for , were he known to be her's , though he were dearer to me than ever
<font> she <$$font> was , I would turn him from my house , and cast him
from my heart , as I have done her . INCHBALD-1793-2,31.64

<font> Har. <$$font> I believe you ; INCHBALD-1793-2,31.65

- and in compassion to the child , give you my <font> solemn promise
<$$font> never to reveal who he is . INCHBALD-1793-2,31.66

I have heard that those unfortunate parents left an infant behind when
they went abroad , and that they now lament him as lost .
INCHBALD-1793-2,31.67

Will you satisfy my curiosity , in what manner you sought and found him
out ? INCHBALD-1793-2,31.68

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Do you suppose I searched for him ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,31.69

No ; he was forced upon me . INCHBALD-1793-2,31.70

A woman followed me , about eight years ago , in the fields adjoining to
my country seat , with a half-starved boy in her hand ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,31.71

and asked my charity for my grand-child : INCHBALD-1793-2,31.72

the impression of the word , made me turn round involuntarily ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,31.73

and casting my eyes , upon him , I was rejoiced , not to find a feature
of his mother's in all his face ; INCHBALD-1793-2,31.74

and I began to feel something like pity for him . INCHBALD-1793-2,31.75

In short , he caught such fast hold by one of my fingers , that I asked
him carelessly " if he would go home and live with me ? " On which , he
answered me so willingly " Yes , " I took him at his word ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,31.76

<P_32>

<font> Har. <$$font> And did never your regard for him , plead on his
mother's behalf ? INCHBALD-1793-2,32.78

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Never . INCHBALD-1793-2,32.79

For , by Heaven . I would as soon forgive the robber who met me last
night at my own door , and , holding a pistol to my breast , took from
me a sum to a considerable amount , as I would pardon her .
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.80

<font> Har. <$$font> Did such an accident happen to you ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.81

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Have you not heard of it ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.82

<font> Har. <$$font> No . INCHBALD-1793-2,32.83

<font> Lord N. <$$font> It is amazing we can@ @not put a stop to such
depredations . INCHBALD-1793-2,32.84

<font> Har. <$$font> Provisions are so scarce ! INCHBALD-1793-2,32.85

<font> Enter <$$font> Servant . INCHBALD-1793-2,32.86

<font> Ser. <$$font> Miss Wooburn , my Lord , if you are not engaged ,
will come and sit an hour with you . INCHBALD-1793-2,32.87

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I have no company but what she is perfectly
acquainted with , INCHBALD-1793-2,32.88

and shall be glad of her visit . INCHBALD-1793-2,32.89

<font> Exit Servant , <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,32.90

<font> Har. <$$font> You forget I am a stranger , and my presence may
not be welcome . INCHBALD-1793-2,32.91

<font> Lord N. <$$font> A stranger ! INCHBALD-1793-2,32.92

What to my ward ? to Lady Ramble ? INCHBALD-1793-2,32.93

for that is the name which custom would authorise her to keep ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.94

but such courtesy she disdains , in contempt of the unworthy giver of
the title . INCHBALD-1793-2,32.95

<font> Har. <$$font> I am intimate with Sir Robert , my Lord ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.96

and though I acknowledge that both you and his lady have cause for
complaint , yet Sir Robert has still many virtues .
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.97

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Not one . INCHBALD-1793-2,32.98

He is the most vile , the most detestable of characters .
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.99

He not only contradicted my will in the whole of his conduct ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.100

but he seldom met me that he did not give me some personal affront .
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.101

<font> Har. <$$font> It is , however , generally held better to be
uncivil in a person's presence , than in his absence .
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.102

<font> Lord N. <$$font> He was uncivil to me in every respect .
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.103

<P_33>

<font> Har. <$$font> That I will deny ; INCHBALD-1793-2,33.105

for I have heard Sir Robert , in your absence , say such things in your
praise ! INCHBALD-1793-2,33.106

- <font> Lord N. <$$font> Indeed ! INCHBALD-1793-2,33.107

<font> Har. <$$font> Most assuredly . INCHBALD-1793-2,33.108

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I wish he had sometimes done me the honour to
have spoken politely to my face . INCHBALD-1793-2,33.109

<font> Har. <$$font> That is not Sir Robert's way ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,33.110

- he is no flatterer . INCHBALD-1793-2,33.111

But then , no sooner has your back been turned {TEXT:tarned} , than I
have heard him lavish in your praise . INCHBALD-1793-2,33.112

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I must own , Mr Harmony , that I never looked
upon Sir Robert as incorrigible . INCHBALD-1793-2,33.113

I could always discern a ray of understanding and a beam of virtue
through all his foibles ; INCHBALD-1793-2,33.114

nor would I have urged the divorce , but that I found his wife's ,
sensibility could not bear his neglect ; INCHBALD-1793-2,33.115

and even now , notwithstanding her endeavour to conceal it , she pines
in secret , INCHBALD-1793-2,33.116

and laments her hard fortune . INCHBALD-1793-2,33.117

All my hopes of restoring her health rest on one prospect - that of
finding a man worthy of my recommendation for her second husband , and ,
by creating a second passion , expel the first . INCHBALD-1793-2,33.118

- Mr Harmony , you and I have been long acquainted .
INCHBALD-1793-2,33.119

- I have known your disposition from your infancy .
INCHBALD-1793-2,33.120

- Now , if such a man as you were to offer - INCHBALD-1793-2,33.121

<font> Har. <$$font> You flatter me . INCHBALD-1793-2,33.122

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I do not . INCHBALD-1793-2,33.123

- Would you venture to become her husband ? INCHBALD-1793-2,33.124

<font> Har. <$$font> I can@ @not say I have any particular desire ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,33.125

but if it will oblige either you or her , - for my part I think the
short time we live in this world , we should do all we can to oblige
each other . INCHBALD-1793-2,33.126

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I should rejoice at such an union myself ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,33.127

and I think I can answer for her . INCHBALD-1793-2,33.128

- You permit me then to make overtures to her in your name ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,33.129

<font> Har. <$$font> <paren> <font> considering . <$$paren> <$$font>
This is rather a serious piece of business - INCHBALD-1793-2,33.130

However , I never did make a difficulty <P_34> when I wished to oblige a
friend . INCHBALD-1793-2,34.131

- But there is one proviso , my Lord ; INCHBALD-1793-2,34.132

I must first mention it to Sir Robert . INCHBALD-1793-2,34.133

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Why so ? INCHBALD-1793-2,34.134

<font> Har. <$$font> Because he and I have always been very intimate
friends ; INCHBALD-1793-2,34.135

and to marry his wife without telling him of it , will appear very
uncivil ! INCHBALD-1793-2,34.136

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Do you mean then to ask his consent ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.137

<font> Har. <$$font> Not absolutely his consent ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.138

but I will insinuate the subject to him , and obtain his approbation in
a manner suitable to my own satisfaction . INCHBALD-1793-2,34.139

<font> Lord N. <$$font> You will oblige me then if you will see him as
early as possible ; INCHBALD-1793-2,34.140

for it is reported he is going abroad . INCHBALD-1793-2,34.141

<font> Har. <$$font> I will go to him immediately ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.142

and , my Lord , I will do all in my power to oblige you , Sir Robert and
the Lady ; INCHBALD-1793-2,34.143

<font> <paren> aside . <$$paren> <$$font> - but as to obliging myself ,
that was never one of my considerations . INCHBALD-1793-2,34.144

<paren> <font> Exit . <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,34.145

<font> Enter Miss Wooburn . <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,34.146

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I am sorry to see you thus ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.147

you have been weeping ? INCHBALD-1793-2,34.148

Will you still lament your separation from a cruel husband ; as if you
had followed a kind one to the grave ? INCHBALD-1793-2,34.149

<font> Miss W. <$$font> By no means , my Lord . INCHBALD-1793-2,34.150

Tears from our sex are not always the result of grief ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.151

they are frequently no more than little sympathetic tributes which we
pay to our fellow-beings , while the mind and the heart are steeled
against the weakness which our eyes indicate . INCHBALD-1793-2,34.152

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Can you say , your mind and heart are so
steeled ? INCHBALD-1793-2,34.153

<font> Miss W. <$$font> I can : INCHBALD-1793-2,34.154

My mind is as firmly fixed against Sir Robert Ramble , as , at our first
acquaintance , it was fixed upon him . INCHBALD-1793-2,34.155

And I solemnly protest - INCHBALD-1793-2,34.156

<font> Lord N. <$$font> To a man of my age and observation ,
protestations are vain . INCHBALD-1793-2,34.157

- Give me a proof that you have rooted him from your heart .
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.158

<P_35>

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Any proof you require , I will give without a
moment's hesitation . INCHBALD-1793-2,35.160

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I take you at your word ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.161

and desire you to accept a Gentleman , whom I shall recommend for your
second husband . INCHBALD-1793-2,35.162

<paren> <font> Miss <$$font> Wooburn <font> starts . <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.163

- You said you would not hesitate a moment . INCHBALD-1793-2,35.164

<font> Miss W. <$$font> I thought I should not ; INCHBALD-1793-2,35.165

but this is something so unexpected - INCHBALD-1793-2,35.166

<font> Lord N. <$$font> You break your word then ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.167

and still give cause for this ungrateful man , to ridicule your fondness
for him . INCHBALD-1793-2,35.168

<font> Miss W. <$$font> No , I will put an end to that humiliation ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.169

and whoever the gentleman {TEXT:gentelman} is whom you mean to propose -
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.170

Yet , do not name him at present - INCHBALD-1793-2,35.171

but give me the satisfaction of keeping the promise I have made to you
<paren> at least for a little time <$$paren> without exactly knowing how
far it extends ; INCHBALD-1793-2,35.172

for , in return , I have a promise to ask from you , before I acquaint
you with the nature of your engagement . INCHBALD-1793-2,35.173

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I give my promise . INCHBALD-1793-2,35.174

Now name your request . INCHBALD-1793-2,35.175

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Then , my Lord , <font> hesitating and confused
<$$font> <$$paren> - the law gave me back , upon my divorce from Sir
Robert , the very large fortune which I brought to him .
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.176

- I am afraid , that in his present circumstances , to enforce the
strict payment of this debt , would very much embarrass him .
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.177

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What if it did ? INCHBALD-1793-2,35.178

<font> Miss W. <$$font> It is my entreaty to you <paren> in whose hands
is invested the power to demand this right of law <$$paren> to lay my
claim aside for the present . INCHBALD-1793-2,35.179

<paren> <font> Lord <$$font> Norland <font> offers to speak <$$font>
<$$paren> I know , my Lord , what you are going to say ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.180

I know Sir Robert is not <font> now , <$$font> but I can never forget
that he <font> has been <$$font> my husband . INCHBALD-1793-2,35.181

<font> Lord N. <$$font> To shew my gratitude for your complaince with
the request I have just made you , <paren> <font> Goes to a table in the
library <$$font> <$$paren> here is the bond by which I am <P_36>
impowered to seize on the greatest {TEXT:greaest} part of his estates in
right of you : INCHBALD-1793-2,36.182

take the bond into your own possession till your next husband demands it
of you ; INCHBALD-1793-2,36.183

and by the time you have called him husband for a few weeks , this
tenderness , or delicacy to Sir Robert , will be worn away .
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.184

<font> Enter <$$font> Harmony <paren> <font> hastily . <$$font>
<$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,36.185

<font> Har. <$$font> My Lord , I beg pardon ; INCHBALD-1793-2,36.186

- but I forgot to mention - INCHBALD-1793-2,36.187

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Oh , Mr Harmony , I have not seen you before I
know not when : INCHBALD-1793-2,36.188

I am particularly happy at your calling just now ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.189

for I have - <paren> <font> hesitating <$$font> <$$paren> a little
favour to ask of you . INCHBALD-1793-2,36.190

<font> Har. <$$font> If it were a great favour , Madam , you might
command me . INCHBALD-1793-2,36.191

<font> Miss W. <$$font> But - my Lord , I beg your pardon .
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.192

- but the favour I have to ask of Mr Harmony must be told to him in
private . INCHBALD-1793-2,36.193

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Oh , I am sure , I have not the least objection
to you and Mr Harmony having a private conference .
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.194

I@ @'ll leave you together . INCHBALD-1793-2,36.195

<paren> Harmony <font> appears embarrassed . <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.196

You do not derange my business - INCHBALD-1793-2,36.197

I@ @'ll be back in a short time . INCHBALD-1793-2,36.198

<paren> <font> Exit . <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,36.199

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Mr Harmony , you are the very man on earth I
most wanted to see . INCHBALD-1793-2,36.200

<paren> Harmony <font> bows . <$$font> <$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,36.201

I know the kindness of your heart , the liberality of your sentiments ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.202

and I wish to repose a charge to your trust , very near to me indeed -
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.203

but you must be secret . INCHBALD-1793-2,36.204

<font> Har. <$$font> When a Lady reposes a trust in me , I should not
be a man if I were not . INCHBALD-1793-2,36.205

<font> Miss W. <$$font> I must first inform you , that Lord Norland has
just drawn from me a promise , that I will once more enter into the
marriage-state ; INCHBALD-1793-2,36.206

and without knowing to whom he intends to give me , I will keep my
promise - INCHBALD-1793-2,36.207

But it is in vain to say , that though I mean all duty and fidelity to
my second husband , I shall not experience moments when my thoughts -
will wander on my first . INCHBALD-1793-2,36.208

<P_37>

<font> Har. <paren> starting . <$$paren> <$$font> Hem - Hem ! -
<paren> <font> To her <$$font> - indeed ? INCHBALD-1793-2,37.210

<font> Miss W. <$$font> I must always rejoice in Sir Robert's successes
, and lament over his misfortunes . INCHBALD-1793-2,37.211

<font> Har. <$$font> If that is all - INCHBALD-1793-2,37.212

<font> Miss W. <$$font> No , I would go one step further :
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.213

<paren> Harmony <font> starts again <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.214

I would secure him from those misfortunes , which to hear of , will
disturb my peace of mind . INCHBALD-1793-2,37.215

I know his fortune has suffered very much , INCHBALD-1793-2,37.216

and I can@ @not , <font> will not , <$$font> place it in the power of
the man , whom my Lord Norland may point out for my next marriage , to
distress him farther . INCHBALD-1793-2,37.217

- This is the writing , by which that Gentleman may claim the part of my
fortune from Sir Robert Ramble , which is in landed property ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.218

carry it , my dear Mr Harmony , to Sir Robert instantly ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.219

and tell him , that in separating from him , I meant only to give him
liberty ; not make him the debtor , perhaps the prisoner of my future
husband . INCHBALD-1793-2,37.220

<font> Har. <$$font> Madam , I will most undoubtedly take this bond to
my friend ; INCHBALD-1793-2,37.221

but will you give me leave to suggest to you , that the person on whom
you bestow your hand , may be a little surprised to find , that while he
is in possession of you , Sir Robert is in the possession of your
fortune ? INCHBALD-1793-2,37.222

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Do not imagine , Sir , that I shall marry any
man , without {TEXT:witout} first declaring what I have done -
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.223

I only wish at present it should be concealed from Lord Norland -
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.224

When this paper is given , as I have required , it can@ @not be recalled
; INCHBALD-1793-2,37.225

and when that is past , I shall divulge my conduct to whom I please ;
and first of all , to him , who shall offer me his addresses .
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.226

<font> Har. <$$font> And if he is a man of my feelings , his addresses
will be doubly importunate for this proof of liberality to your former
husband . INCHBALD-1793-2,37.227

- But are you sure , that in the return of this bond , there is no
secret affection , no latent spark of love ? INCHBALD-1793-2,37.228

<font> Miss W. <$$font> None . INCHBALD-1793-2,37.229

I know my heart : INCHBALD-1793-2,37.230

and if there <P_38> was , I could not ask you , Mr Harmony <paren> nor
any one like you <$$paren> , to be the messenger of an imprudent passion
. INCHBALD-1793-2,38.231

Sir Robert's vanity , I know , may cause him to judge otherwise ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.232

but undeceive him ; INCHBALD-1793-2,38.233

let him know this is a sacrifice to the golden principles of duty , and
not an offering to the tinselled shrine of love .
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.234

<font> Enter Lord <$$font> Norland . INCHBALD-1793-2,38.235

Put up the bond . INCHBALD-1793-2,38.236

- <paren> Harmony <font> conceals it . <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.237

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Well , my dear , have you made your request .
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.238

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Yes , my Lord . INCHBALD-1793-2,38.239

<font> Lord N. <$$font> And has he granted it ? INCHBALD-1793-2,38.240

<font> Har. <$$font> Yes , my Lord , I am going to grant it .
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.241

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I sincerely wish you both joy of this good
understanding between you . INCHBALD-1793-2,38.242

But , Mr Harmony , <paren> <font> in a whisper <$$font> <$$paren> are
not you going to Sir Robert ? INCHBALD-1793-2,38.243

<font> Har. <$$font> Yes , my Lord , I am going this moment
{COM:missing_punctuation} INCHBALD-1793-2,38.244

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Make haste then , INCHBALD-1793-2,38.245

and do not forget your errand . INCHBALD-1793-2,38.246

<font> Har. <$$font> No , my Lord , I sha'@ @n't forget my errand ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.247

it wo@ @n't slip my memory - INCHBALD-1793-2,38.248

Good morning , my Lord - INCHBALD-1793-2,38.249

good morning , Madam . INCHBALD-1793-2,38.250

<font> Exit . <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,38.251

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Now , my dear , as you and Mr Harmony seem to
be on such excellent terms , I think I may venture to tell you <paren>
if he has not yet told you himself , <$$paren> that he is the man who is
to be your husband . INCHBALD-1793-2,38.252

<font> Miss W. <$$font> He ! INCHBALD-1793-2,38.253

Mr Harmony ! INCHBALD-1793-2,38.254

- No , my Lord , he has not told me ; INCHBALD-1793-2,38.255

and I am confident he never will . INCHBALD-1793-2,38.256

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What makes you think so ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.257

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Because - because - he must be sensible he
would not be the man I should choose . INCHBALD-1793-2,38.258

<font> Lord N. <$$font> And where is the woman who marries ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.259

the man she would choose ? INCHBALD-1793-2,38.260

You are reverting the order of society ; INCHBALD-1793-2,38.261

men , only , have the right of choice in marriage .
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.262

Were women permitted theirs , we should have handsome beggars allied to
our noblest families , and no such object in our whole island as an old
maid . INCHBALD-1793-2,38.263

<P_39>

<font> Miss W. <$$font> But being denied that choice , why forbid to
remain as I am ? INCHBALD-1793-2,39.265

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What are you now ? INCHBALD-1793-2,39.266

Neither a widow , a maid , nor a wife . INCHBALD-1793-2,39.267

If I could fix a term to your present state , I should not be thus
anxious to place you in another . INCHBALD-1793-2,39.268

<font> Miss W. <$$font> I am perfectly acquainted with your friendly
motives , INCHBALD-1793-2,39.269

and feel the full force of your advice . INCHBALD-1793-2,39.270

- I therefore renew my promise INCHBALD-1793-2,39.271

and although Mr Harmony <paren> in respect to the marriage state
<$$paren> is as little to my wishes as any man on earth , I will
nevertheless endeavour - whatever struggles it may cost me - to be to
him , if he prefers his suit , a dutiful , an obedient -
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.272

but , for a loving wife , that I can never be again ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.273

<paren> <font> Exeunt severally . <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,39.274

Scene . INCHBALD-1793-2,39.276

<font> An Apartment at Sir <$$font> Robert Ramble <font> 's . <$$font>
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.277

<$$heading>

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Robert <font> and Mr <$$font> Harmony .
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.279

<font> Sir R. <$$font> I thank you for this visit .
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.280

I was undetermined what to do with myself . INCHBALD-1793-2,39.281

Your company has determined me to stay at home . INCHBALD-1793-2,39.282

<font> Har. <$$font> I was with a gentleman just now , Sir Robert ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.283

and you were the subject of our conversation , INCHBALD-1793-2,39.284

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Had it been a Lady , I should be anxious to know
what she said . INCHBALD-1793-2,39.285

<font> Har. <$$font> I have been with a Lady likewise ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.286

and she made you the subject of her discourse . INCHBALD-1793-2,39.287

<font> Sir R. <$$font> But was she handsome ? INCHBALD-1793-2,39.288

<font> Har. <$$font> Very handsome . INCHBALD-1793-2,39.289

<font> Sir R. <$$font> My dear fellow , what is her name ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.290

What did she say , INCHBALD-1793-2,39.291

and where may I meet with her ? INCHBALD-1793-2,39.292

<font> Har. <$$font> Her name is Wooburn . INCHBALD-1793-2,39.293

<font> Sir R. <$$font> That is the name of my late wife .
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.294

<font> Har. <$$font> It is her I mean . INCHBALD-1793-2,39.295

<P_40>

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Zounds , you had just put my spirits into a
flame , INCHBALD-1793-2,40.297

and now you throw cold water all over me . INCHBALD-1793-2,40.298

<font> Har. <$$font> I am sorry to hear you say so ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.299

for I came from her this moment ; INCHBALD-1793-2,40.300

and what do you think is the present she has given me to deliver to you
? INCHBALD-1793-2,40.301

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Pshaw ! I want no presents .
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.302

Some of my old love-letters returned , I suppose , to remind me of my
inconstancy ! INCHBALD-1793-2,40.303

<font> Har. <$$font> Do not undervalue her generosity :
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.304

this is her present ; - this bond , which has power to take from you
three_thousand a year , her right . INCHBALD-1793-2,40.305

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Ah ! this is a present indeed .
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.306

Are you sure you speak truth ? INCHBALD-1793-2,40.307

Let me look at it : INCHBALD-1793-2,40.308

- Sure my eyes deceive me ! INCHBALD-1793-2,40.309

- No , by heaven it is true ! INCHBALD-1793-2,40.310

<paren> <font> Reads . <$$font> <$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,40.311

The very thing I wanted , and will make me perfectly happy .
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.312

Now I@ @'ll be generous again ; INCHBALD-1793-2,40.313

my bills shall be paid , my gaming debts cancelled ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.314

poor Irwin shall find a friend ; INCHBALD-1793-2,40.315

and I@ @'ll send her as pretty a copy of verses as ever I wrote in my
life . INCHBALD-1793-2,40.316

<font> Har. <$$font> Take care how you treat with levity a woman of her
elevated mind . INCHBALD-1793-2,40.317

She charged me to assure you , " that love has no share whatever in this
act , but merely compassion to the embarrassed state of your affairs .
" INCHBALD-1793-2,40.318

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Sir , I would have you to know , I am no object
of compassion . INCHBALD-1793-2,40.319

However , a Lady's favour one can@ @not return ; INCHBALD-1793-2,40.320

and so , I@ @'ll keep this thing . INCHBALD-1793-2,40.321

<paren> <font> Puts it in his pocket , <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,40.322

<font> Har. <$$font> Nay , if your circumstances are different from
what she imagines , give it me back , and I will return it to her .
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.323

<font> Sir R. <$$font> No , poor thing ! INCHBALD-1793-2,40.324

it would break her heart to send it back . INCHBALD-1793-2,40.325

- No I@ @'ll keep it . INCHBALD-1793-2,40.326

- She would never forgive me , were I to send it back .
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.327

I@ @'ll keep it . INCHBALD-1793-2,40.328

And she is welcome to attribute her concern for me to what she pleases .
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.329

But surely you can see - INCHBALD-1793-2,40.330

you understand - INCHBALD-1793-2,40.331

But Heaven bless <P_41> her for her love ! INCHBALD-1793-2,41.332

and I would love her in return - if I could . INCHBALD-1793-2,41.333

<font> Har. <$$font> You would not talk thus , if you had seen the firm
dignity with which she gave me that paper - INCHBALD-1793-2,41.334

Assure him , " said she , " no remaining affection comes along with it ,
but merely a duty which I owe to him , to protect him from the
humiliation of being a debtor to the man whom I am going to marry . "
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.335

<font> Sir R. <$$font> <paren> <font> with the utmost emotion ,
<$$font> <$$paren> Why , she is not going to be married again !
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.336

<font> Har. <$$font> I believe , so . INCHBALD-1793-2,41.337

<font> Sir R. <$$font> But are you sure of it , Sir ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.338

Are you sure of it ? INCHBALD-1793-2,41.339

<font> Har. <$$font> Both she and her guardian told me so .
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.340

<font> Sir R. <$$font> That guardian , my Lord Norland {TEXT:Noreland}
, is one of the basest , vilest of men . INCHBALD-1793-2,41.341

- I tell you what , Sir , INCHBALD-1793-2,41.342

I@ @'ll resent this usage . INCHBALD-1793-2,41.343

<font> Har. <$$font> Wherefore ? INCHBALD-1793-2,41.344

- As to his being the means of bringing about your separation , in that
he obliged you . INCHBALD-1793-2,41.345

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Yes , Sir , he did , INCHBALD-1793-2,41.346

he certainly did ; INCHBALD-1793-2,41.347

- but though I am not the least offended with him on that head , <paren>
for at that I rejoice , <$$paren> yet I will resent his disposing of her
a second time . INCHBALD-1793-2,41.348

<font> Har. <$$font> And why ? INCHBALD-1793-2,41.349

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Because , little regard as I have for her myself
, yet no other man shall dare to treat her so ill , as I have done .
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.350

<font> Har. <$$font> Do not fear it - INCHBALD-1793-2,41.351

Her next husband will be a man , who , I can safely say , will never
insult , or even offend her ; but sooth , indulge , and make her happy .
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.352

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And do you dare to tell me , that her next
husband will make her happy ? INCHBALD-1793-2,41.353

Now that is worse than the other - INCHBALD-1793-2,41.354

No , Sir , no man shall ever have it to say " he has made her either
happy or miserable , " but myself . INCHBALD-1793-2,41.355

<P_42>

<font> Har. <$$font> I know of but one way to prevent it .
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.357

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And what is that ? INCHBALD-1793-2,42.358

<font> Har. <$$font> Pay your addresses to her , INCHBALD-1793-2,42.359

and marry her again yourself . INCHBALD-1793-2,42.360

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And I would , rather than she should be happy
with any body else . INCHBALD-1793-2,42.361

The devil take me if I would not . INCHBALD-1793-2,42.362

<font> Har. <$$font> To shew that I am wholly disinterested in this
affair , I will carry her a letter from you , if you like , and say all
I can in your behalf . INCHBALD-1793-2,42.363

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Ha , ha , ha ! INCHBALD-1793-2,42.364

Now , my dear Harmony , you carry your good-natured simplicity too far .
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.365

However , I thank you , INCHBALD-1793-2,42.366

I sincerely thank you . INCHBALD-1793-2,42.367

- But do you imagine I should be such a blockhead , as to make love to
that same woman I made love to seven years ago , and who for the last
six years I totally neglected ? INCHBALD-1793-2,42.368

<font> Har. <$$font> Yes : for if you neglected her six years , she
will now be a novelty . INCHBALD-1793-2,42.369

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Egad , and so she will . INCHBALD-1793-2,42.370

You are right . INCHBALD-1793-2,42.371

<font> Har. <$$font> But being in possession of her fortune , you can
be very happy without her . INCHBALD-1793-2,42.372

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Take her fortune back , Sir <paren> <font>
Taking the bond from his pocket , and offering it to <$$font> Harmony .
<$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,42.373

I would starve , INCHBALD-1793-2,42.374

I would perish , die in poverty and infamy , rather than owe an
obligation to a vile , perfidious , inconstant woman .
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.375

<font> Har. <$$font> Consider , Sir Robert , if you insist on my taking
this bond back , it may fall into the husband's hands .
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.376

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Take it back - INCHBALD-1793-2,42.377

I insist upon it INCHBALD-1793-2,42.378

<paren> <font> Gives it him , INCHBALD-1793-2,42.379

and <$$font> Harmony <font> puts it up . <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.380

But , Mr Harmony , depend on it , Lord Norland shall hear from me , in
the most serious manner , for his interference . INCHBALD-1793-2,42.381

I repeat , he is the vilest , the most villanous of men .
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.382

<font> Har. <$$font> How can you speak with such rancour of a nobleman
, who speaks of you in the highest terms ? INCHBALD-1793-2,42.383

<P_43>

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Does he , ' faith ? INCHBALD-1793-2,43.385

<font> Har. <$$font> He owns you have some faults .
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.386

<font> Sir <$$font> R. I know I have . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.387

<font> Har. <$$font> But he thinks your good qualities are numberless .
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.388

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Now dam' me , if ever I thought so ill of <font>
him , <$$font> as I have appeared to do ! INCHBALD-1793-2,43.389

- But who is the intended husband , my dear friend ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.390

Tell me , that I may laugh at him , and make you laugh at him .
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.391

<font> Har. <$$font> No , I am not inclined to laugh at him .
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.392

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Is it old Solus ; INCHBALD-1793-2,43.393

<font> Har. <$$font> No . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.394

<font> Sir <$$font> R. But I will bet you a wager it is somebody
equally ridiculous . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.395

<font> Har. <$$font> I never bet . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.396

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Solus is mad for a wife , INCHBALD-1793-2,43.397

and has been praising mine up to the heavens ; INCHBALD-1793-2,43.398

you need say no more ; INCHBALD-1793-2,43.399

I know it is he . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.400

<font> Har. <$$font> Upon my honour , it is not .
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.401

However I can@ @not disclose to you at present the person's name ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.402

I must first obtain Lord Norland's permission . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.403

<font> Sir <$$font> R. I shall ask you no more .
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.404

I@ @'ll write to her - INCHBALD-1793-2,43.405

she will tell me ; INCHBALD-1793-2,43.406

- or , I@ @'ll pay her a visit , and ask her boldly myself .
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.407

- Do you think <paren> <font> anxiously <$$font> <$$paren> - do you
think she would see me ? INCHBALD-1793-2,43.408

<font> Har. <$$font> You can but try . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.409

<font> Enter <$$font> Servant . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.410

<font> Ser. <$$font> Mr Solus . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.411

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Now I find out the secret immediately .
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.412

- I@ @'ll charge him with being the intended husband .
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.413

<font> Har. <$$font> I will not stay to hear you .
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.414

<font> Enter <$$font> Solus . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.415

Mr. Solus , how do you do ? INCHBALD-1793-2,43.416

I am extremely sorry that my engagements take me away as soon as you
enter . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.417

<paren> <font> Exit <$$font> Har. <font> running , to avoid an
explanation . <$$font> <$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,43.418

<font> Sol. <$$font> Sir Robert , what is the matter ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.419

Has any thing ruffled you ? INCHBALD-1793-2,43.420

Why , I never saw you look more out of temper , even while you were
married . INCHBALD-1793-2,43.421

<P_44>

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Ah ! that I had never married ! never known
what marriage was ! INCHBALD-1793-2,44.423

for , even at this moment , I feel its torments in my heart .
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.424

<font> Sol. <$$font> I have often heard of the torments of matrimony ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.425

but I conceive , that at the worst , they are nothing more than a kind
of violent tickling , which will force the tears into your eyes , though
at the same time you are bursting your sides with laughter .
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.426

<font> Sir R. <$$font> You have defined marriage too favourably ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.427

there is no laughter in the state : INCHBALD-1793-2,44.428

all is melancholy , all gloom . INCHBALD-1793-2,44.429

<font> Sol. <$$font> Now I think marriage is an excellent remedy for
the spleen . INCHBALD-1793-2,44.430

I have known a gentleman at a feast receive an affront , disguise his
rage , step home , vent it all upon his wife , return to his companions
, and be as good company as if nothing had happened .
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.431

. <font> Sir R. <$$font> But even the necessary expences of a wife
should alarm you . INCHBALD-1793-2,44.432

<font> Sol. <$$font> I can then retrench some of my own .
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.433

Oh ! my dear Sir , a married man has so many delightful privileges to
what a bachelor has ! INCHBALD-1793-2,44.434

- An old lady will introduce her daughters to you in a dishabille -
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.435

" It does not signify , my dears , INCHBALD-1793-2,44.436

it@ @'s a married man " - INCHBALD-1793-2,44.437

One lady will suffer you to draw on her glove - INCHBALD-1793-2,44.438

" Never mind , INCHBALD-1793-2,44.439

it@ @'s a married man " - INCHBALD-1793-2,44.440

Another will permit you to pull on her slipper ; INCHBALD-1793-2,44.441

a third will even take you into her bed-chamber - INCHBALD-1793-2,44.442

" Pshaw , it@ @'s <font> nothing <$$font> but a married man . "
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.443

<font> Sir R. <$$font> But the weight of your fetters will overbalance
all these joys . INCHBALD-1793-2,44.444

<font> Sol. <$$font> And I can@ @not say , notwithstanding you are
relieved from the bond , that I see much joy or brightness here .
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.445

<font> Sir R. <$$font> I am not very well at present ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.446

I have the head-ach ; INCHBALD-1793-2,44.447

and , if ever a wife can be of comfort to her husband , it must be when
he is indisposed . INCHBALD-1793-2,44.448

A <P_45> wife , then , binds up your head , INCHBALD-1793-2,45.449

mixes your powders , INCHBALD-1793-2,45.450

bathes your temples , INCHBALD-1793-2,45.451

and hovers about , in a way that is most endearing .
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.452

<font> Sol. <$$font> Do@ @n't speak of it ; INCHBALD-1793-2,45.453

I long to have one hover about me . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.454

But I will - INCHBALD-1793-2,45.455

I am determined I will , before I am a week older .
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.456

Do@ @n't speak , INCHBALD-1793-2,45.457

do@ @n't attempt to persuade me not . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.458

Your description has renewed my eagerness - INCHBALD-1793-2,45.459

I will be married . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.460

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And without pretending not to know who you mean
to make your wife , I tell you plainly , it is , Miss Wooburn , - it is
my late wife . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.461

- I know you have made overtures to my Lord Norland , and that he has
given his consent . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.462

<font> Sol. <$$font> You tell me a great piece of news -
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.463

I@ @'ll go ask my Lord if it be true ; INCHBALD-1793-2,45.464

and if he says it is , I shall be very glad to find it so .
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.465

<font> Sir R. <$$font> That is right , Sir ; INCHBALD-1793-2,45.466

marry her , INCHBALD-1793-2,45.467

marry her ; INCHBALD-1793-2,45.468

I give you joy , INCHBALD-1793-2,45.469

- that@ @'s all . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.470

- Ha , ha , ha ! INCHBALD-1793-2,45.471

I think I should know her temper - INCHBALD-1793-2,45.472

But if you will venture to marry her , I sincerely wish you happy .
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.473

<font> Sol. <$$font> And if we are not , you know we can be divorced .
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.474

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Not always . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.475

Take my advice , INCHBALD-1793-2,45.476

and live as you are . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.477

<font> Sol. <$$font> You almost stagger my resolution -
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.478

I had painted such bright prospects of marriage : INCHBALD-1793-2,45.479

Good day to you . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.480

<paren> <font> going , returns . <$$font> <$$paren> - You think I had
better not marry ? INCHBALD-1793-2,45.481

<font> Sir R. <$$font> You are undone if you do .
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.482

<font> Sol. <paren> sighing . <$$font> <$$paren> <font> You <$$font>
ought to know from experience . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.483

<font> Sir R. <$$font> From that I speak . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.484

<font> Sol. <$$font> <paren> <font> Going to the door , and returning
once or twice , as unstable in his resolution . <$$font> <$$paren> But
then what a poor disconsolate object shall I live , without a wife to
hover about me ; to bind up my head , and bathe my temples !
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.485

Oh ! I am impatient for all the chartered rights , privileges , and
immunities of a married man . INCHBALD-1793-2,45.486

<paren> <font> Exit . <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,45.487

<P_46>

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Furies , racks , torments -
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.489

I can@ @not bear what I feel , INCHBALD-1793-2,46.490

and yet I am ashamed to own I feel any thing ! INCHBALD-1793-2,46.491

<font> Enter Mr <$$font> Placid . INCHBALD-1793-2,46.492

<font> Pla. <$$font> My dear Sir Robert , give me joy .
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.493

Mrs Placid and I are come to the very point you advised ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.494

matters are in the fairest way for a separation .
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.495

<font> Sir R. <$$font> I do give you joy , and most sincerely .
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.496

- You are right ; INCHBALD-1793-2,46.497

you@ @'ll soon be as happy as I am , <paren> <font> sighing . <$$font>
<$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,46.498

But would you suppose it ? INCHBALD-1793-2,46.499

that deluded woman , my wife , is going to be married again !
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.500

I thought she had enough of me ! INCHBALD-1793-2,46.501

<font> Pla. <$$font> You are hurt , I see , lest the world should say
she has forgot you . INCHBALD-1793-2,46.502

<font> Sir R. <$$font> She can@ @not forget me ; INCHBALD-1793-2,46.503

I defy her to forget me . INCHBALD-1793-2,46.504

<font> Pla. <$$font> Who is her intended husband ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.505

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Solus , Solus . An old man - an ugly man ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.506

He left me this moment , INCHBALD-1793-2,46.507

and owned it - owned it ! INCHBALD-1793-2,46.508

Go after him , will you , INCHBALD-1793-2,46.509

and persuade him not to have her . INCHBALD-1793-2,46.510

<font> Pla. <$$font> My advice will have no effect ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.511

for you know he is bent upon matrimony . INCHBALD-1793-2,46.512

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Then {TEXT:Theu} could not you , my dear Sir
<paren> as you are going to be separated <$$paren> , could not you
{TEXT:yon} recommend him to marry your wife . INCHBALD-1793-2,46.513

- It will be all the same to him , I dare say , INCHBALD-1793-2,46.514

and I shall like it much better . INCHBALD-1793-2,46.515

<font> Pla. <$$font> Ours will not be a divorce , consider , but merely
a separate maintenance . INCHBALD-1793-2,46.516

But were it otherwise , I wish no man so ill , as to wish him married to
Mrs. Placid . INCHBALD-1793-2,46.517

<font> Sir R. <$$font> That is my case exactly .
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.518

I wish no man so ill , as to wish him married to my Lady Ramble ; and
poor old Solus in particular , poor old man ! a very good sort of a man
- INCHBALD-1793-2,46.519

I have a great friendship for Solus . INCHBALD-1793-2,46.520

- I ca@ @n't stay a moment in the house - INCHBALD-1793-2,46.521

I must go somewhere - INCHBALD-1793-2,46.522

I@ @'ll go to Solus . INCHBALD-1793-2,46.523

- No , I@ @'ll go <P_47> to Lord Norland - INCHBALD-1793-2,47.524

No , I will go to Harmony ; INCHBALD-1793-2,47.525

and then I@ @'ll call on you , INCHBALD-1793-2,47.526

<font> An Apartment at Mr. <$$font> Harmony <font> 's .
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.533

Enter Mr. <$$font> Harmony . INCHBALD-1793-2,47.534

<$$heading>

Harmony . And now , for one of the most painful tasks that brotherly
love ever draw upon me ; to tell another , the suit , of which I gave
him hope , has failed . INCHBALD-1793-2,47.536

- Yet , if I can but overcome Captain Irwin's delicacy so far , as to
prevail on him to accept one proof more of my good wishes towards him ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.537

- but to a man of his nice sense of obligations , the offer must be made
with caution . INCHBALD-1793-2,47.538

<font> Enter Lord Norland . <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,47.539

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Mr Harmony , I beg your pardon :
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.540

I come in thus abruptly , from the anxiety I feel concerning what passed
between us this morning in respect to Miss Wooburn .
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.541

You have not changed your mind , I hope ? INCHBALD-1793-2,47.542

<font> Har. <$$font> Indeed , my Lord , I am very sorry that it will
not be in my power to oblige you . INCHBALD-1793-2,47.543

<font> Lord N. <$$font> <paren> <font> in anger . <$$font> <$$paren>
How , Sir ? INCHBALD-1793-2,47.544

Did not you give me your word ? INCHBALD-1793-2,47.545

<font> Har. <$$font> Only conditionally , my Lord .
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.546

<font> Lord N. <$$font> And what were the conditions ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.547

<P_48>

<font> Har. <$$font> Have you forgot them ? INCHBALD-1793-2,48.549

Her former husband . INCHBALD-1793-2,48.550

<font> Ser. <$$font> Sir Robert Ramble is in his carriage at the door ,

<font> Har. <$$font> Why should you shun him ? INCHBALD-1793-2,48.559

<font> Lord N. <$$font> because he used his wife ill .
INCHBALD-1793-2,48.560

<font> Har. <$$font> He did . INCHBALD-1793-2,48.561

But I believe he is very sorry for it . INCHBALD-1793-2,48.562

- And as for you , he said to me only a few hours ago -
INCHBALD-1793-2,48.563

but no matter . INCHBALD-1793-2,48.564

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What did he say ? INCHBALD-1793-2,48.565

I insist upon knowing . INCHBALD-1793-2,48.566

<font> Har. <$$font> Why then he said , " that if he had a sacred trust
to repose in any one , <font> you <$$font> should be the man on earth ,
to whom he will confide it . " INCHBALD-1793-2,48.567

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Well , I am in no hurry ;

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Yes , Sir Robert , Miss Wooburn is tolerably

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Only tolerably , my Lord ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.592

I am sorry for that . INCHBALD-1793-2,49.593

<font> Har. <$$font> I hope , my Lord , you will excuse my mentioning

but I was telling Sir Robert just now , of your intentions respecting a
second marriage for that Lady ; INCHBALD-1793-2,49.595

but Sir Robert does not appear to approve of the design .
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.596

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What objection can <font> he <$$font> have ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.597

<font> Sir R. <$$font> My Lord , there are such a number of bad
husbands ; INCHBALD-1793-2,49.598

there are such a number of dissipated , unthinking , unprincipled men !
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.599

- And - I should be extremely sorry to see any Lady with whom I have had
the honour of being so closely allied , united to one who would
undervalue her worth . INCHBALD-1793-2,49.600

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Pray , Sir Robert , were you not then extremely
sorry for her , while she was united to you ? INCHBALD-1793-2,49.601

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Very sorry for her indeed , my Lord .
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.602

But , at that time , my mind was so taken up with other cares , I own I
did not feel the compassion which was her due ; INCHBALD-1793-2,49.603

but now that I am single , I shall have leisure to pay her more
attention ; INCHBALD-1793-2,49.604

and should I find her unhappy , it must , inevitably , make me so .
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.605

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Depend upon it , that on the present occasion ,
I shall take infinite care in the choice of her husband .
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.606

<font> Sir R. <$$font> If your Lordship would permit me to <P_50> have
an interview with Miss Wooburn , I think I should be able at least -
INCHBALD-1793-2,50.607

<font> Lord N. <$$font> You would not sure insult her by your presence
? INCHBALD-1793-2,50.608

<font> Sir R. <$$font> I think I should be able at least to point out
an object worthy of her taste - INCHBALD-1793-2,50.609

I know what she will like better than any body in the world .
INCHBALD-1793-2,50.610

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Her request has been , that I may point her out
a husband the reverse of you . INCHBALD-1793-2,50.611

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Then , upon my honour , my Lord , she wo@ @n't
like him . INCHBALD-1793-2,50.612

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Have not you liked women the reverse of her ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,50.613

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Yes , my Lord , perhaps I have ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,50.614

and perhaps I still do . INCHBALD-1793-2,50.615

I do not pretend to love <font> her ; <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,50.616

I did not say I did ; INCHBALD-1793-2,50.617

nay , I positively protest I do not ; INCHBALD-1793-2,50.618

but this indifference I acknowledge as one of my faults ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,50.619

INCHBALD-1793-2,50.629

<font> Sir R. <$$font> My Lord , I feel myself a little embarrassed .
INCHBALD-1793-2,50.630

- I am afraid I have made myself a little ridiculous upon this occasion
- INCHBALD-1793-2,50.631

Will your Lordship do me the favour to forget it ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,50.632

<P_51>

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I will forget whatever you please .
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.634

<font> Har. <$$font> <paren> <font> following him , whispers .
<$$font> <$$paren> I am sorry to see you going away in despair .
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.635

<font> Sir R. <$$font> I never did despair in my life , Sir ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.636

and while a woman is the object of my wishes , I never will .
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.637

<paren> <font> Exit . <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,51.638

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What did he say ? INCHBALD-1793-2,51.639

<font> Har. <$$font> That he thought your conduct that of a just and an
upright man . INCHBALD-1793-2,51.640

<font> Lord N. <$$font> To say the truth , he has gone away with better
manners than I could have imagined , considering his jealousy is
provoked . INCHBALD-1793-2,51.641

<font> Har. <$$font> Ah ! I always knew he loved his wife ,
notwithstanding his behaviour to her ; INCHBALD-1793-2,51.642

for , if you remember , he always spoke well of her behind her back .
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.643

<font> Lord N. <$$font> No , I do not remember it .
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.644

<font> Har. <$$font> Yes , he did ; INCHBALD-1793-2,51.645

and that is the only criterion of a man's love , or of his friendship .
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.646

<font> Enter Servant . Sir . <$$font> A young gentleman is at the door
, Sir , enquiring for Lord Norland . INCHBALD-1793-2,51.647

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Who can it be ? INCHBALD-1793-2,51.648

<font> Har. <$$font> Your young gentleman from home , I dare say .
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.649

Desire him to walk in . INCHBALD-1793-2,51.650

Bring him here . INCHBALD-1793-2,51.651

<paren> <font> Exit Servant . <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,51.652

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What business can he have to follow me ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.653

<font> Enter <$$font> Edward . INCHBALD-1793-2,51.654

<font> Ed. <$$font> Oh , my Lord , I beg your pardon for coming hither
; INCHBALD-1793-2,51.655

but I come to tell you something you will be glad to hear .
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.656

<font> Har. <$$font> Good heaven ! how like his mother !
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.657

<font> Lord N. <$$font> <paren> <font> Taking him by the hand .
<$$font> <$$paren> I begin to think he is - INCHBALD-1793-2,51.658

but he was not so when I first took him . INCHBALD-1793-2,51.659

No , no , if he had , he would not have been thus near me now ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.660

but to turn him away , because his countenance is a little changed , I
think would not be right . INCHBALD-1793-2,51.661

<P_52>

<font> Ed. <$$font> <paren> <font> to <$$font> Harmony . <$$paren>
Pray , Sir , did you know my mother . INCHBALD-1793-2,52.663

<font> Har. <$$font> I have seen her . INCHBALD-1793-2,52.664

<font> Ed. <$$font> Did <font> you <$$font> ever see her , my Lord ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.665

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I thought you had orders never to enquire about
your parents ? INCHBALD-1793-2,52.666

Have you forgot those orders ? INCHBALD-1793-2,52.667

<font> Ed. <$$font> No , my Lord ; but when this gentleman said
{TEXT:sai} I was like my mother - it put me in mind of her .
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.668

<font> Har. <$$font> You do not remember your mother , do you ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.669

<font> Ed. <$$font> Sometimes I think I do . INCHBALD-1793-2,52.670

I think sometimes I remember her kissing me , when she and my father
went on board of a ship ; INCHBALD-1793-2,52.671

and so hard she pressed me - I think I feel it now .
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.672

<font> Har. <$$font> Perhaps she was the only Lady that ever saluted
you ? INCHBALD-1793-2,52.673

<font> Ed. <$$font> No , Sir , not by many . INCHBALD-1793-2,52.674

<font> Lord N. <$$font> But pray young man , <paren> to have done with
this subject , <$$paren> what brought you here ? INCHBALD-1793-2,52.675

You seem to have forgot your errand ? INCHBALD-1793-2,52.676

<font> Ed. <$$font> And so I had , upon my word .
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.677

Speaking of my mother , put it quite out of my head .
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.678

But , my Lord , I came to let you know , the robber who stopped you last
night is taken . INCHBALD-1793-2,52.679

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I am glad to hear it . INCHBALD-1793-2,52.680

<font> Ed. <$$font> I knew you would , INCHBALD-1793-2,52.681

and therefore I begged to be the first to tell you .
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.682

<font> Har. <$$font> <paren> <font> to Lord <$$font> Norland .
<$$paren> Should you know the person again ? INCHBALD-1793-2,52.683

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I can@ @not say I should ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.684

his face seemed so much distorted . INCHBALD-1793-2,52.685

<font> Har. <$$font> Ay , wretched man ! INCHBALD-1793-2,52.686

I suppose with terror . INCHBALD-1793-2,52.687

<font> Lord N. <$$font> No ; it appeared a different passion from fear
. INCHBALD-1793-2,52.688

<font> Ed. <$$font> Perhaps , my Lord , it was <font> your <$$font>
fear that made you think so . INCHBALD-1793-2,52.689

<font> Lord N. <$$font> No , Sir , I was not frightened .
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.690

<P_53>

<font> Ed. <$$font> Then why did you give him your money ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.692

<font> Lord N. <$$font> It was surprise caused me to do that .
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.693

<font> Ed. <$$font> I wondered what it was ! INCHBALD-1793-2,53.694

You said it was not fear , INCHBALD-1793-2,53.695

and I was sure it could not be love . INCHBALD-1793-2,53.696

<font> Har. <$$font> How has he been taken ? INCHBALD-1793-2,53.697

<font> Ed. <$$font> A person came to our steward ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.698

and informed against him ; INCHBALD-1793-2,53.699

and , Oh ! my Lord , his poor wife told the officers who took him ,
they had met with misfortunes , which she feared had caused a fever in
her husband's head ; INCHBALD-1793-2,53.700

and , indeed ; they found him too ill to be removed ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.701

and so , she hoped , she said , " that as a man , not in his perfect
mind , you would be merciful to him . " INCHBALD-1793-2,53.702

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I will be just . INCHBALD-1793-2,53.703

<font> Ed. <$$font> And that is being merciful , is it not , my Lord ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.704

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Not always . INCHBALD-1793-2,53.705

<font> Ed. <$$font> I thought it had been . INCHBALD-1793-2,53.706

- It is not <font> just <$$font> to be unmerciful , is it ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.707

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Certainly not . INCHBALD-1793-2,53.708

<font> Ed. <$$font> Then it must be <font> just , <$$font> to have
mercy . INCHBALD-1793-2,53.709

<font> Lord N. <$$font> You draw a false conclusion .
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.710

Great as is the virtue of <font> mercy , justice <$$font> is greater
still . INCHBALD-1793-2,53.711

justice holds its place among those cardinal virtues which include all
the lesser . INCHBALD-1793-2,53.712

- Come , Mr Harmony , will you go home with me ? INCHBALD-1793-2,53.713

And before I attend to this business , let me persuade you , to forget
there is such a person in the world as Sir Robert ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.714

and suffer me to introduce you to Miss Wooburn , as the man who -
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.715

<font> Har. <$$font> I beg to be excused - INCHBALD-1793-2,53.716

Besides the consideration of Sir Robert , I have another reason why I
can@ @not go with you . INCHBALD-1793-2,53.717

The melancholy tale which this young gentleman has been telling , has
cast a gloom on my spirits which renders me unfit for the society of a
Lady . INCHBALD-1793-2,53.718

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Now I should not be surprised were <P_54> you
to go in search of this culprit and his family , and come to me , to
entreat me to forego the prosecution ; INCHBALD-1793-2,54.719

but , before you ask me , I tell you it is in vain -
INCHBALD-1793-2,54.720

I will not . INCHBALD-1793-2,54.721

<font> Har. <$$font> Lord Norland , I have lately been so unsuccessful
in my petitions to you , I shall never presume to interpose between your
rigour and a weak sufferer more . INCHBALD-1793-2,54.722

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Plead the cause of the good , and I will listen
; INCHBALD-1793-2,54.723

but you find none but the wicked for your compassion .
INCHBALD-1793-2,54.724

<font> Har. <$$font> The good in all states , even in the very jaws of
death , are objects of envy ; INCHBALD-1793-2,54.725

it is the bad who are the only real sufferers : INCHBALD-1793-2,54.726

There , where no internal consolation cheers , who can refuse a little
external comfort ? INCHBALD-1793-2,54.727

- And let me tell you , my Lord , that amidst all your authority , your
state , your grandeur , I often pity you . <paren> <font> Speaking with
unaffected compassion . <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,54.728

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Good-day , Mr Harmony ; INCHBALD-1793-2,54.729

and when you have apologised for what you have said , we may be friends
again . INCHBALD-1793-2,54.730

<paren> <font> Exit , leading off <$$font> Edward .
INCHBALD-1793-2,54.731

<font> Har. <$$font> Nay , hear my apology now .
INCHBALD-1793-2,54.732

I can@ @not INCHBALD-1793-2,54.733

first time admitted into your house ; to solicit this Lady's hand .
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.831

And , after having had it once , no force shall compel me to take a
refusal . INCHBALD-1793-2,58.832

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I will try however - INCHBALD-1793-2,58.833

Madam , quit the room instantly . INCHBALD-1793-2,58.834

<font> Sir R. <$$font> My Lord , she shall not quit it .
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.835

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I command her to go . INCHBALD-1793-2,58.836

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And I command her to stay .
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.837

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Which of us will you obey ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.838

<font> Miss W. <$$font> My inclination , my Lord , disposes me to obey
you ; INCHBALD-1793-2,58.839

- but I have so lately been accustomed to obey him , that <font> custom
<$$font> inclines me to obey him still . INCHBALD-1793-2,58.840

<font> Sir R. <$$font> There ! There ! There , my Lord !
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.841

Now I hope you will understand better for the future , and not attempt
to interfere between a man and his wife . INCHBALD-1793-2,58.842

<font> Lord N. <$$font> <paren> <font> to her . <$$font> <$$paren> Be
explicit in your answer to this question - INCHBALD-1793-2,58.843

Will you consent to be his wife ? INCHBALD-1793-2,58.844

<font> Miss W. <$$font> No , never . INCHBALD-1793-2,58.845

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Zounds , my Lord , now you are hurrying matters
. INCHBALD-1793-2,58.846

- You should do it by gentle means ; INCHBALD-1793-2,58.847

- let me ask her gently . INCHBALD-1793-2,58.848

<paren> <font> With a most soft voice . <$$font> <$$paren> Maria ,
Maria , will you be my wife once again ? INCHBALD-1793-2,58.849

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Never . INCHBALD-1793-2,58.850

<font> Sir R. <$$font> So you said seven years ago , when I asked you ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.851

and yet you consented . INCHBALD-1793-2,58.852

<font> Lord N. <$$font> And now , Sir Robert , you have had your answer
; INCHBALD-1793-2,58.853

leave my house . <paren> <font> Going up to him . <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.854

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Yes , Sir ; INCHBALD-1793-2,58.855

but not without my other half . INCHBALD-1793-2,58.856

<font> Lord N. <$$font> " Your other half ? " INCHBALD-1793-2,58.857

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Yes , the wife of my bosom - the wife , <P_59>
whom I swore at the altar " to love and to cherish , " and , forsaking
all others , cleave only to her as " long as we both should live . "
INCHBALD-1793-2,59.858

<font> Lord N. <$$font> You broke your oath , INCHBALD-1793-2,59.859

and made the contract void . INCHBALD-1793-2,59.860

<font> Sir R. <$$font> But I am ready to take another oath ; and
another after that , and another after that - INCHBALD-1793-2,59.861

And , Oh , my dear Maria , be propitious to my vows ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,59.862

and give me hopes you will again be mine . INCHBALD-1793-2,59.863

<paren> <font> He goes to her , INCHBALD-1793-2,59.864

and kneels in the most supplicating attitude . <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,59.865

<font> Enter <$$font> Edward , <font> shewing in Mr <$$font> Solus
<font> and Mr <$$font> Placid ; INCHBALD-1793-2,59.866

Edward <font> points to Sir <$$font> Robert <paren> <font> who has his
back to them <$$font> <$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,59.867

<font> and goes off . <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,59.868

<font> Sir R. <$$font> <paren> <font> Still on his knees , and not
perceiving their entrance . <$$font> <$$paren> I can@ @not live without
you . INCHBALD-1793-2,59.869

- Receive your penitent husband , thus humbly acknowledging his faults ,
and imploring you to accept him once again . INCHBALD-1793-2,59.870

<font> Sol. <$$font> <paren> <font> Going up to Sir <$$font> Robert .
<$$paren> Now , is it wonderful that I should want a wife .
INCHBALD-1793-2,59.871

<font> Pla. <$$font> And is it to be wondered at , if I should hesitate
about parting with mine ? INCHBALD-1793-2,59.872

<font> Sir R. <$$font> <paren> <font> Starts up in great confusion .
<$$font> <$$paren> Mr Solus , Mr Placid , I am highly displeased that my
private actions should be thus inspected . INCHBALD-1793-2,59.873

<font> Sol. <$$font> No one shall persuade me now , to live a day
without a wife . INCHBALD-1793-2,59.874

<font> Pla. <$$font> And no one shall persuade me now , not to be
content with my own . INCHBALD-1793-2,59.875

<font> Sol. <$$font> I will procure a special licence , and marry the
first woman I meet . INCHBALD-1793-2,59.876

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Mr Solus , you are , I believe , interested in a
peculiar manner , about the marriage of this Lady .
INCHBALD-1793-2,59.877

<font> Sol. <$$font> And poor man , you are sick ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,59.878

and want somebody to " bathe your temples , " and to " hover about you .
" INCHBALD-1793-2,59.879

<font> Miss W. <$$font> You come in most opportunely , my dear <P_60>
Mr Solus , to be a witness - INCHBALD-1793-2,60.880

<font> Sir R. <$$font> " My dear Mr Solus ! " INCHBALD-1793-2,60.881

<font> Sol. <$$font> To be a witness , Madam , that a man is miserable
without a wife . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.882

I have been a fatal instance of that , for some time .
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.883

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Come to me then , INCHBALD-1793-2,60.884

and receive a lesson . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.885

<font> Sir R. <$$font> No , Madam , he shall not come to you ;
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.886

nor shall he receive a lesson . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.887

No one shall receive a lesson from you , but me .
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.888

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Sir Robert , one would suppose by this
extraordinary behaviour , you were jealous . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.889

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And so I am , my Lord ; INCHBALD-1793-2,60.890

I have cause to be so . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.891

<font> Lord N. <$$font> No cause to be jealous of Mr Solus -
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.892

He is not Miss Wooburn's lover , I assure you . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.893

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Then , my Lord , I verily believe it is yourself
. INCHBALD-1793-2,60.894

Yes , I can see it is ; INCHBALD-1793-2,60.895

I can see it by her eyes , and by every feature in your face .
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.896

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Oh ! my good friend , Mr Placid , only listen
to him . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.897

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And why " my good friend , Mr Placid ? "
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.898

<paren> <font> To <$$font> Placid . <$$paren> By Heavens , Sir , I
believe that you only wished to get rid of your own wife , in order to
marry mine . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.899

<font> Pla. <$$font> I do not wish to part with my own wife , Sir
Robert , since what I have just seen . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.900

<font> Sir R. <paren> Going up to <$$font> Solus <font> and Lord
<$$font> Norland . <$$paren> Then , pray , gentlemen , be so good as to
tell me , which of you two is the happy man , that I may know how to
conduct myself towards him ? INCHBALD-1793-2,60.901

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Ha , ha , ha ! INCHBALD-1793-2,60.902

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Do you insult me , Maria ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.903

- Oh ! have pity on my sufferings . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.904

<font> Sol. <$$font> If you have a mind to kneel down again , we will
go out of the room . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.905

<font> Pla. <$$font> just as I was comforting myself with the prospect
of a divorce , I find my instructor and director pleading on his knees
to be remarried . INCHBALD-1793-2,60.906

<P_61>

<font> Enter Mrs <$$font> Placid . INCHBALD-1793-2,61.908

<font> Mrs Pla. <$$font> What were you saying about a divorce ?
INCHBALD-1793-2,61.909

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Now , down on your knees ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,61.910

and beg pardon . INCHBALD-1793-2,61.911

<font> Miss W. <$$font> My dear Mrs Placid , if this visit is to me , I
take it very kind . INCHBALD-1793-2,61.912

<font> Mrs Pla. <$$font> Not absolutely to you , my dear .
INCHBALD-1793-2,61.913

I saw Mr Placid's carriage at the door , INCHBALD-1793-2,61.914

and so I stepped in to desire him to go home . INCHBALD-1793-2,61.915

Go home directly . INCHBALD-1793-2,61.916

<font> Pla. <$$font> Presently , my dear ; I will go presently .
INCHBALD-1793-2,61.917
