Act II . DAVYS-1716-1,23.4

Scene <font> Lady <$$font> Ample <font> 's <$$font> . DAVYS-1716-1,23.5

<$$heading>

<font> Lady <$$font> Ample , <font> Lady <$$font> Swish , <font> Lady
<$$font> Cordivant , <font> and Lady <$$font> Greasy , <font> set at
Breakfast , with hot Ale and Ginger , Butter , Rolls , a huge <$$font>
Cheshire <font> Cheese , and a Plate of drunken Toast , before them .
<$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,23.7

L. <font> Swish . <$$font> And as I was telling your Ladyship , my
Husband , Alderman <font> Swish <$$font> , lost three of his best
Customers , for refusing his Vote to Capt. <font> Flip . <$$font>
DAVYS-1716-1,23.8

L. <font> Cor. <$$font> Aye , aye , it@ @'s an easier Matter to lose
one's Customers by refusing a Vote , than get new ones by giving on@ @'t
. DAVYS-1716-1,23.9

L. <font> Am. <$$font> But , Madam , if the Alderman lost his
Customers , he gain'd his Cause ; DAVYS-1716-1,23.10

and that was worth something . DAVYS-1716-1,23.11

L. <font> Cor. <$$font> So it was , Madam ; DAVYS-1716-1,23.12

and he that has got it , is an honest Gentleman . DAVYS-1716-1,23.13

I promis'd him my Husband's Vote , when he was not at Home ,
DAVYS-1716-1,23.14

and had much ado to make him stand to it ; DAVYS-1716-1,23.15

but next Morning I had a Ham and a Hare sent me , DAVYS-1716-1,23.16

and that brought him over to my Side . DAVYS-1716-1,23.17

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Marry , when my Husband's Worship was alive , I
got nothing for his Vote , but a Kiss , and a Couple of Congees ,
DAVYS-1716-1,23.18

and thought my self hugely paid <P_24> too : DAVYS-1716-1,24.19

for he was a curious fine Gentleman , DAVYS-1716-1,24.20

and smelt like any Perfumer's Shop : DAVYS-1716-1,24.21

But I wish'd I had not seen him ; DAVYS-1716-1,24.22

for I could not abide my own Husband for above a Month after .
DAVYS-1716-1,24.23

L. <font> Swish . <$$font> Well , my Lady <font> Greasy <$$font> , if
you got nothing but a Kiss and a Compliment , your Neighbour , Mrs.
<font> Double <$$font> , got something else , DAVYS-1716-1,24.24

or she@ @'s fouly bely'd . DAVYS-1716-1,24.25

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Nay , Ladies , if you introduce Scandal , you
invade the Rights of the Tea-Table ; DAVYS-1716-1,24.26

and since you will have none of the Liquor , pray let@ @'s have none of
the Talk . DAVYS-1716-1,24.27

Lady <font> Greasy <$$font> , why do@ @n't you drink your Ale ?
DAVYS-1716-1,24.28

You@ @'ll let it be cold . DAVYS-1716-1,24.29

I wish I had known of your coming , DAVYS-1716-1,24.30

I would have had something better for you . DAVYS-1716-1,24.31

L. <font> Gre. <$$font> Indeed , my Lady , every Thing is very good ;
DAVYS-1716-1,24.32

but I can drink no more , unless we had had a Bit of Flesh ;
DAVYS-1716-1,24.33

a Collop of Bacon , or hung Beef , would have done well .
DAVYS-1716-1,24.34

L. <font> Am. <$$font> I am sorry I am no better provided of suitable
Meat for such Stomachs . <bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket>
DAVYS-1716-1,24.35

But if you will please to stay the frying of an Egg and a Collop , my
Maid shall do it in a Motion . DAVYS-1716-1,24.36

L. <font> Swish . <$$font> No , Madam , by no Means ;
DAVYS-1716-1,24.37

it@ @'s too late now : DAVYS-1716-1,24.38

But where is the young Gentlewoman that we came to drink with :
DAVYS-1716-1,24.39

Must we not have her good Company , to take a Cup of hotted Ale with us
? DAVYS-1716-1,24.40

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Yes , yes , Madam , she will be here presently
; DAVYS-1716-1,24.41

she happens to be up this Morning , which is a Wonder ;
DAVYS-1716-1,24.42

for she is one of those that loves no Companion in the Morning so well
as her Bed . DAVYS-1716-1,24.43

And I am sure such Company must needs confirm her in her Choice .
<bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> DAVYS-1716-1,24.44

But here she comes . DAVYS-1716-1,24.45

<font> Enter <$$font> Isabella <font> , DAVYS-1716-1,24.46

all rise but Lady <$$font> Greasy . DAVYS-1716-1,24.47

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Sweet Mrs. <font> Isbel <$$font> , pray excuse
me ; DAVYS-1716-1,24.48

for I have got such a Pain in my Huck-bone , that when I am once set , I
ca@ @n't get up again . DAVYS-1716-1,24.49

<font> Isa. <$$font> Pray , Ladies , be pleas'd to sit .
DAVYS-1716-1,24.50

I suppose , Madam , you have got a Cold in your Hip .
DAVYS-1716-1,24.51

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> No , Mrs. <font> Isbel <$$font> , I have had
it a great while , DAVYS-1716-1,24.52

and they tell me 't@ @is a Certificate . DAVYS-1716-1,24.53

L. <font> Am. <$$font> I rather fancy , Madam , it is a <font>
Sciatica . <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,24.54

<P_25>

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Nay , I know not , DAVYS-1716-1,25.56

it@ @'s some hard Word ; DAVYS-1716-1,25.57

but whatever they call it , I am sure I feel it . DAVYS-1716-1,25.58

<font> <paren> Belches <$$paren> <$$font> Oh ! wo worth this Wind ,
DAVYS-1716-1,25.59

it just overcomes me . DAVYS-1716-1,25.60

<font> Isa. Aside . <$$bracket> <$$font> Aye , and every Body else , a
nasty Pole-Cat . DAVYS-1716-1,25.61

<font> To Lady <$$font> Ample . Madam , have you no Brandy for my Lady
; DAVYS-1716-1,25.62

<bracket> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$bracket> for I fancy that@ @'s what
she would be at . DAVYS-1716-1,25.63

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Aye , Mrs. <font> Isbel {COM:sic_font_change}
<$$font> , you know what@ @'s good for an old Woman .
DAVYS-1716-1,25.64

Truly I never us'd to drink Brandy 'til now of late , that I have been
troubled with an Expression at my Stomach . DAVYS-1716-1,25.65

<font> Isa. Aside . <$$bracket> <$$font> So , this is like her
Certificate . DAVYS-1716-1,25.66

She has abundance of new Distempers . DAVYS-1716-1,25.67

Ladies , will any of you drink a Dish of Tea this Morning ?
DAVYS-1716-1,25.68

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> No , Mrs. <font> Isbel <$$font> , no ; we are
for none of your far-fetch'd Liquors . DAVYS-1716-1,25.69

Tea ! what is it good for , but to swill one's Guts , scald the Teeth
out , and never warm the Heart . DAVYS-1716-1,25.70

No , I thank you , DAVYS-1716-1,25.71

we are for none of your Tea . DAVYS-1716-1,25.72

<font> Isa. <$$font> I doubt , Madam , you@ @'re not sociable , if you
do@ @n't drink Tea . DAVYS-1716-1,25.73

I am sure you are in a Neighbourhood where they drink a great deal .
DAVYS-1716-1,25.74

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Yes , yes , but I do@ @n't like 'em ;
DAVYS-1716-1,25.75

they are too proud , DAVYS-1716-1,25.76

and knows not how to behave themselves to their Betters .
DAVYS-1716-1,25.77

There@ @'s one of them but a Knight's Wife , DAVYS-1716-1,25.78

and she , forsooth , must sit above me , tho' my Husband was a Lord ;
nay , one of the best Sort of Lords , DAVYS-1716-1,25.79

he was Lord-Mayor . DAVYS-1716-1,25.80

L. <font> Swish . <$$font> Aye , and another proud Flirt jostled me
from the Head of the Table , tho' her Husband was but a paultry Officer
, a Colonel , or some such Thing . DAVYS-1716-1,25.81

<font> Isa. Aside . <$$bracket> <$$font> I have not Patience with
those ignorant Brutes . DAVYS-1716-1,25.82

Ladies , you speak with too much Contempt . DAVYS-1716-1,25.83

There are a great many fine Gentlemen in the Army , that behave
themselves with as much good Manners and Gallantry at Home , as Bravery
and Honour Abroad . DAVYS-1716-1,25.84

L. <font> Swish . <$$font> Aye , aye ; I know you young Ladies like
their fine Fringes and Feathers . DAVYS-1716-1,25.85

But what do you think of Captain <font> Tinsel <$$font> , Madam ?
DAVYS-1716-1,25.86

<font> Isa. <$$font> I do@ @n't know much of him ; DAVYS-1716-1,25.87

but allowing him to be a Man of no Worth , would you condemn a <P_26>
whole Society because they happen to have one Scoundrel among 'em .
DAVYS-1716-1,26.88

<font> Enter a Servant . <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,26.89

<font> Serv. <$$font> Madam , Sir <font> Jeffrey Hearty <$$font> is
just alighted , DAVYS-1716-1,26.90

and desires to know if your Ladyship be at Leisure . DAVYS-1716-1,26.91

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Wait on him up Stairs . DAVYS-1716-1,26.92

<bracket> <font> Exit Serv. <$$font> <$$bracket> DAVYS-1716-1,26.93

You@ @'ll pardon the Freedom I take , Ladies , in introducing a Stranger
into your Company , DAVYS-1716-1,26.94

but he is a Relation , and a Country Gentleman , one that wo@ @n't
overload you with Compliments {TEXT:Complements} , I dare promise you .
DAVYS-1716-1,26.95

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Jeffrey . DAVYS-1716-1,26.96

L. <font> Am. <$$font> You@ @'re welcome to <font> York , <$$font> Sir
<font> Jeffrey . <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,26.97

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Cousin <font> Ample <$$font> , I am yours .
DAVYS-1716-1,26.98

Cousin <font> Bella <$$font> , I am glad to see you .
DAVYS-1716-1,26.99

Ladies , your humble Servant . DAVYS-1716-1,26.100

<bracket> <font> Salutes them all . <$$font> <$$bracket>
DAVYS-1716-1,26.101

Aye , this is like the good old_fashion'd Way of House-keeping .
DAVYS-1716-1,26.102

I expected to have found you all set round a Table no bigger than a
Past-board , and not much stronger , by my Troth , with a Parcel of
little Crocks , that hold no more than a Girl would drink before her
Sweet-heart . DAVYS-1716-1,26.103

Come , have you left any Thing , that a Man may partake with you ?
DAVYS-1716-1,26.104

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Aye , Sir , you Brede of me ;
DAVYS-1716-1,26.105

you and I shou'd do mains weell together . DAVYS-1716-1,26.106

I am for something in my Stomach that will keep out the Wind , and not
swill my Guts with hot Water , 'till one may hear it swash as I go .
DAVYS-1716-1,26.107

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Truly , Madam , you are in the right on@ @'t .
DAVYS-1716-1,26.108

The Women in this Age mind nothing but their Pleasure ,
DAVYS-1716-1,26.109

and study nothing but how to consume their Husband's Money .
DAVYS-1716-1,26.110

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Rise at Noon . DAVYS-1716-1,26.111

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Dine at Night . DAVYS-1716-1,26.112

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Go to Bed in the Morning . DAVYS-1716-1,26.113

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> As soon as thay@ @'re up , call <font> Jenny
<$$font> to hang on the Tea-Kettle , and bring them a clear-starch'd
Muslin Apron . DAVYS-1716-1,26.114

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Aye ; and for fear it should keep too long
clean , the Dog with his mucky Paws must be laid upon it .
DAVYS-1716-1,26.115

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> When the Tea@ @'s ready they sit down ,
DAVYS-1716-1,26.116

and eat and drink 'till they are ready to burst ; DAVYS-1716-1,26.117

and then <P_27> their Husbands or Fathers must pity them , because they
can eat no Dinner . DAVYS-1716-1,27.118

<font> Isa. <$$font> I wonder , Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font> , how you ,
that live in the Country , come to be so well acquainted with the
Behaviour of the Ladies of <font> York ! <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,27.119

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Oh , Madam , 't@ @is not the first Time I have
been among the Ladies of <font> York . <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,27.120

As soon as the Cloth@ @'s taken away , thay dispatch a Courier to three
or four Idlers , like themselves , to make up a Set at Lue , at which ,
when thay have lost all their Money , and fall'n out , thay begin to
dress for the Assembly . L. <font> Am. <$$font> Where , as Mr.
<font> Congreve <$$font> says , the Coroner's Inquest fits upon all the
murder'd Reputations of the Town . DAVYS-1716-1,27.121

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> True , Madam . DAVYS-1716-1,27.122

<font> Isa. <$$font> But pray , Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font> , how must
your Spouse behave herself when you get her ? DAVYS-1716-1,27.123

If she must rise at four to look after her Dairy , and keep undress'd
herself to dress your Dinner , I think she might as well have taken one
of your Tenants as your self ; DAVYS-1716-1,27.124

for Nature has made no Difference betwixt a Gentlewoman and a
Kitchen-Wench ; DAVYS-1716-1,27.125

it is the Sweets of Life that has done it , DAVYS-1716-1,27.126

and if we must not enjoy them , they are of no Use .
DAVYS-1716-1,27.127

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Well said , my little <font> Bell . <$$font>
DAVYS-1716-1,27.128

Come , come , you and I must talk again about this Matter .
DAVYS-1716-1,27.129

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Pray , my Lady <font> Ample <$$font> , will you
call your Maid , that we may know what Bread and Ale we have had ;
DAVYS-1716-1,27.130

for I must needs be going . DAVYS-1716-1,27.131

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Ladies , I should take it as the greatest Mark
of your Favour , if you would dispense with the Custom of the Town for
once , and let this little Treat be mine . DAVYS-1716-1,27.132

L. <font> Swish . <$$font> By no Means , Madam ; DAVYS-1716-1,27.133

I had as lieve break a Leg or an Arm , as an old Custom .
DAVYS-1716-1,27.134

L. <font> Cor. <$$font> No , my Lady , no ; DAVYS-1716-1,27.135

this has been a Custom Time out of Mind . DAVYS-1716-1,27.136

Our ancient and loyal City of <font> York <$$font> , has always been
famous for keeping up an hearty and neighbourly Way among our selves ,
which keeps us all Friends ; DAVYS-1716-1,27.137

for eating , as well as lying together , makes Folks love .
DAVYS-1716-1,27.138

<P_28>

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Well , Ladies , if it must be so , I had better
submit my single Opinion , than oppose so many superior ones .
DAVYS-1716-1,28.140

Here , <font> Susan <$$font> , bring a Plate , DAVYS-1716-1,28.141

and let us know what Bread and Ale we have had . DAVYS-1716-1,28.142

Sir <font> Jef. Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> How much Bread and Ale !
DAVYS-1716-1,28.143

what a Plague do they mean ? DAVYS-1716-1,28.144

<font> Enter <$$font> Susan <font> with a Plate . <$$font>
DAVYS-1716-1,28.145

<font> Su. <$$font> There@ @'s four Quarts of Country Ale , one of
strong Beer , and three_Pennyworth of Bread . DAVYS-1716-1,28.146

L. <font> Cor. <$$font> Pri@ @thee , Barn , tell us how much it comes
to ; DAVYS-1716-1,28.147

for we are no great Reckoners . DAVYS-1716-1,28.148

<font> Su. Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> No , so it seems , by my Troth
. DAVYS-1716-1,28.149

Madam , it comes to just two and nine Pence . DAVYS-1716-1,28.150

L. <font> Gr. takes the Plate . <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,28.151

Come then , our Twelvepence a-piece does it , DAVYS-1716-1,28.152

and there@ @'s something for the Maid . DAVYS-1716-1,28.153

<font> Su. Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> Take two and nine Pence out of
three Shilling , DAVYS-1716-1,28.154

and what remains ? DAVYS-1716-1,28.155

A Pox on their Threepenny Present . DAVYS-1716-1,28.156

<bracket> <font> The Ladies get up , DAVYS-1716-1,28.157

and take their Leaves . <$$font> <$$bracket> DAVYS-1716-1,28.158

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> Susan . DAVYS-1716-1,28.159

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Good Morrow , my good Lady <font> Ample
<$$font> , DAVYS-1716-1,28.160

and thank you for me . DAVYS-1716-1,28.161

Sweet Mrs. <font> Isbel <$$font> , your Servant , DAVYS-1716-1,28.162

Servant Sir . DAVYS-1716-1,28.163

<bracket> <font> Exeunt <$$font> Ladies . DAVYS-1716-1,28.164

<font> Isa. <$$font> So , Thanks to my Stars , I am rid of my Plague .
DAVYS-1716-1,28.165

I had rather sit in the Stocks all Day , and hear the Mob sing Ballads ,
than be consin'd to the Impertinence of those worshipful Ladies .
DAVYS-1716-1,28.166

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Why what a Pox , DAVYS-1716-1,28.167

Cousin <font> Ample <$$font> , do you invite Folks to your House , and
then make them pay the Reckoning . DAVYS-1716-1,28.168

Belike I shall have my Beer to pay for by_and_by . DAVYS-1716-1,28.169

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Ha , ha , ha : No , Sir <font> Jeffrey ,
<$$font> you shall come off scot-free , I warrant you .
DAVYS-1716-1,28.170

I would not , you see , have taken their Money , but in Compliance to a
foolish Custom , of which they are very fond , tho' they pay for@ @'t .
DAVYS-1716-1,28.171

You might have minded my Opposition put 'em into a mighty Stickle in
Defence of their Privileges . DAVYS-1716-1,28.172

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> A foolish Custom , quoth@ @a !
DAVYS-1716-1,28.173

Is it your Custom to go to one another's Houses , guzzle five or six
Quarts of Ale , and then club round to pay for@ @'t ?
DAVYS-1716-1,28.174

<P_29>

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Nay , Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font> , if you find
Fault with our Proceedings , you must no more be admitted into our
Society . DAVYS-1716-1,29.176

I do assure you , this Humour prevails all the Town over ,
DAVYS-1716-1,29.177

and every trivial Occasion brings them together . DAVYS-1716-1,29.178

<font> Isa. <$$font> Aye , aye , if a Friend comes to Town , they come
to drink with you for Joy ; DAVYS-1716-1,29.179

if they go out of Town , they come to help you to wash away Sorrow ; so
that the good People are resolv'd to share both your Pleasure and your
Pain , provided they may have a little Victuals and Drink to keep up
their Spirits . DAVYS-1716-1,29.180

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> I have often heard of the Gossips of <font>
York <$$font> , DAVYS-1716-1,29.181

but never saw any of 'em before . DAVYS-1716-1,29.182

Pray what extraordinary Occasion brought 'em here to_Day .
DAVYS-1716-1,29.183

<font> Isa. <$$font> They came , I thank 'em , to drink with me , as
they call it . DAVYS-1716-1,29.184

To_Morrow , I suppose , Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font> , they will come and
drink you to Town . DAVYS-1716-1,29.185

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Gad's Bud , I would they would , by the Lord
Harry , DAVYS-1716-1,29.186

I@ @'d make 'em a Boul of Punch should send 'em Home so chirping merry ,
they should remember me 'till I came again ; DAVYS-1716-1,29.187

and then , if they would , I@ @'d make 'em another .
DAVYS-1716-1,29.188

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Truly , Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font> , I believe
if some of 'em knew your Mind , they would go near to take you at your
Word ; DAVYS-1716-1,29.189

for they do@ @n't love Tea . DAVYS-1716-1,29.190

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Well , my little Bell , how many Sweethearts
hast got ? DAVYS-1716-1,29.191

Come , I doubt you@ @'re hard to please . DAVYS-1716-1,29.192

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Aye , Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font> , so she is .
DAVYS-1716-1,29.193

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Come , I believe I must bring her one from the
Races , a brisk young Fellow that can leap over a five_barr'd Gate ,
either a Foot or a Horseback ; can hollow after a Pack of Dogs , without
straining his lungs ; and gallop after a Hare , without breaking the
Neck . DAVYS-1716-1,29.194

What say you to that , my Lass ? DAVYS-1716-1,29.195

<font> Isa. <$$font> I say Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font> , you have not
describ'd the Man I like , DAVYS-1716-1,29.196

I should be better pleas'd with one that lov'd less violent Exercises ,
and gave me less Fears in his Absence ; DAVYS-1716-1,29.197

for whatever Pleasure he might take Abroad , I am sure I should not have
much at Home , when I came to consider his Danger . DAVYS-1716-1,29.198

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Well said , my little <font> Bell ; <$$font>
DAVYS-1716-1,29.199

by my Troth , that Answer is worth a Pint of Sack . DAVYS-1716-1,29.200

Why thou <P_30> hast too much good Nature in thee for a modern Wife ,
DAVYS-1716-1,30.201

and vow to Gad I believe will love thy Husband . DAVYS-1716-1,30.202

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Gad , I have a good {TEXT:good_a} Mind to

<font> Isa. <$$font> No , Sir , I ca@ @n't promise to be equally
complaisant to all Men alike neither ; DAVYS-1716-1,30.209

for as I am resolv'd to love the Man I marry , I am resolv'd to marry
the Man I love ; DAVYS-1716-1,30.210

for Love , like Charity , covers a Multitude of Faults .
DAVYS-1716-1,30.211

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font> , will you dine

<font> Isa. <$$font> No , Madam ; DAVYS-1716-1,30.221

but I can say they have brought me something worse than nothing .
DAVYS-1716-1,30.222

It will be very hard if my Person and Fortune can command nothing better
than an old Country Knight . DAVYS-1716-1,30.223

L. <font> Am. <$$font> True , Child ; DAVYS-1716-1,30.224

Me@ @thinks , Madam , you that have a Taste for Wit , should never
prefer a Fool to a Man of Sense ; DAVYS-1716-1,31.234

succeed , where <font> Gamont <$$font> thinks fit to address .

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Well , <font> Isabella <$$font> , I can but

DAVYS-1716-1,35.376

<font> Lou. . <$$font> Why so , my Dear ? DAVYS-1716-1,35.377

<font> Isa. <$$font> Because it is a general Thing ;
DAVYS-1716-1,35.378

every Man makes Love to every Woman he sees . DAVYS-1716-1,35.379

For my part , I only expect it in my Turn , DAVYS-1716-1,35.380

<font> Lou. <$$font> Phu , phu , this must be Affectation in you ;
because you know your Merit commands Sincerity . DAVYS-1716-1,35.382

<font> Isa. <$$font> Indeed , <font> Louisa <$$font> , I never had
Vanity enough to think any Thing , but my Money , could secure a Heart ;

'T@ @is true , I do love her Brother more than Life ;

<$$heading>

<font> Enter <$$font> Isabella <font> and <$$font> Liddy .
DAVYS-1716-1,37.429

<font> Isa. <$$font> 'T@ @is Pity Nature did not change thy Sex , and
Fortune thy Vocation ; DAVYS-1716-1,37.430

thou wouldst have made an admirable Lawyer ; DAVYS-1716-1,37.431

for I find , as it is , you can speak for your Fee .
DAVYS-1716-1,37.432

<font> Lid. <$$font> If I have taken too great a Freedom , Madam , I
hope your Ladyship will pardon it , DAVYS-1716-1,37.433

't@ @was an Effect of my Zeal . DAVYS-1716-1,37.434

<font> Isa. <$$font> Yes , Zeal for <font> Gamont ; DAVYS-1716-1,37.435

<$$font> but if you had any for my Interest , you would rather persuade
me from him , than take such Pains in his Behalf . DAVYS-1716-1,37.436

You know as well as I he has no Estate . DAVYS-1716-1,37.437

<font> Lid. <$$font> True , Madam ; DAVYS-1716-1,37.438

but your Ladyship knows , and so do I too , he must have one e'er long ;
DAVYS-1716-1,37.439

his old Father must in a little Time resign both it and Life ,
DAVYS-1716-1,37.440

and then - DAVYS-1716-1,37.441

<font> Isa. <$$font> And then perhaps he will be as imperious as he is
now submissive ; DAVYS-1716-1,37.442

therefore say no more , DAVYS-1716-1,37.443

for I am resolv'd to be satisfy'd : DAVYS-1716-1,37.444

My Person comes at least upon a Level with my Money ,
DAVYS-1716-1,37.445

or I must give up all Thoughts of him for ever . DAVYS-1716-1,37.446

<font> Lid. Aside . <$$font> Aye , but , Heaven be prais'd , that@ @'s
out of your Power ; DAVYS-1716-1,37.447

you love him too well for that . DAVYS-1716-1,37.448

Well , Madam , I shou'd be glad to have you satisfy'd ,
DAVYS-1716-1,37.449

but do@ @n't know what Method you can take to be so .
DAVYS-1716-1,37.450

<font> Isa. <$$font> I can do nothing without thy Help .
DAVYS-1716-1,37.451

I heard you say once , you could write a good Man's Hand .
DAVYS-1716-1,37.452

<font> Lid. <$$font> Yes , Madam , if that will be of any Service to
you , so I can . DAVYS-1716-1,37.453

<font> Isa. <$$font> Of very considerable Service : DAVYS-1716-1,37.454

This very Man's Hand of yours must be employ'd in writing a Letter from
my Unkle <font> Richlove <$$font> in <font> London <$$font> to me here
at <font> York <$$font> , to let me know that Alderman <font> Brittle
<$$font> , in whose Hands my Money is , is broke , and gone off with all

<P_38>

<font> Lid. <$$font> I understand your Ladyship : DAVYS-1716-1,38.457

Then if Mr. <font> Gamont - <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,38.458

<font> Isa. <$$font> Aye , then if <font> Gamont <$$font> proves the
Man I wish him , and you believe him , to be , my Person and Fortune are
his ; DAVYS-1716-1,38.459

but if I find any Alteration , I@ @'ll immediately give my self to
another before his Face . DAVYS-1716-1,38.460

<font> Lid. <$$font> And so to revenge your self on a Man you only
fancy does not love you , you will give your self away to one you are
sure you hate . DAVYS-1716-1,38.461

<font> Isa. <$$font> Yes ; DAVYS-1716-1,38.462

and it would be less Mortification to lie in the Arms of one I do@ @n't
love , who I am sure loves me , than be consin'd to one I do , and have
no Return but Indifference . DAVYS-1716-1,38.463

<font> Lid. <$$font> Your Prudence , Madam , is not to be disputed by
me ; DAVYS-1716-1,38.464

but if I were to be hang'd for it , I ca@ @n't forbear thinking you try
the poor Gentleman a little too far , because - DAVYS-1716-1,38.465

<font> Isa. Liddy <$$font> , no more ; DAVYS-1716-1,38.466

I@ @'ll go this Minute and write the Letter for you to copy ;

To tell Mr. <font> Gamont <$$font> , would be to betray my Lady ,
DAVYS-1716-1,38.471

and Treachery I scorn . DAVYS-1716-1,38.472

Yet if I do@ @n't tell him , nothing but Mischief can be the Event .
DAVYS-1716-1,38.473

For to say the Truth , I do@ @n't think his Love runs so high as she
expects ; DAVYS-1716-1,38.474

What the Devil do you mean by asking such a Question ?
DAVYS-1716-1,39.491

<font> Lid. <$$font> Nay , nothing , Sir ; DAVYS-1716-1,39.492

but as the World goes now , there is more Danger of your Sex's revolting

<font> Lid. <$$font> Upon my Word , Sir , no Body has said any Thing to
your Disadvantage ; DAVYS-1716-1,39.500

your Fate lies wholly in your own Behaviour , which must be manag'd with
Circumspection , DAVYS-1716-1,39.501

or your Case may prove a little desperate . DAVYS-1716-1,39.502

<font> Gam. <$$font> Instead of clearing the Matter , you have made it
more intricate ; DAVYS-1716-1,39.503

either speak to be understood , DAVYS-1716-1,39.504

or say nothing . DAVYS-1716-1,39.505

I am sorry for@ @'t , for more Reasons than one . DAVYS-1716-1,42.624

I suppose this will put a full Stop to your Amour ; DAVYS-1716-1,42.625

What will you do ? DAVYS-1716-1,42.626

<font> Gam. <$$font> Do ? DAVYS-1716-1,42.627

I know not what to do ; DAVYS-1716-1,42.628

to go abruptly off will be base , because she made no Scruple of my
Circumstances before this happen'd ; DAVYS-1716-1,42.629

and to persist , will be Folly and Madness . DAVYS-1716-1,42.630

Ods Death I was never so puzzl'd in my Life . DAVYS-1716-1,42.631

Pri@ @thee advise me . DAVYS-1716-1,42.632

<font> Wel. <$$font> I know not how : DAVYS-1716-1,42.633

You must e'en pretend your Father has sent for you Home ;
DAVYS-1716-1,42.634

I know no other Way , unless you art resolv'd to marry her right or
wrong . DAVYS-1716-1,42.635

<font> Gam. <$$font> No ; for her Sake I@ @'ll not marry her now ;
DAVYS-1716-1,42.636

but if she will be content to stay 'till my Father dies , she shall
certainly be my Choice ; DAVYS-1716-1,42.637

for tho' her Fortune began my first Liking , I have found something in
her Person very worthy of my Love : DAVYS-1716-1,42.638

Beside , it <P_43> would be the highest Ingratitude to leave her , if
for no other Reason but because I believe she loves me .
DAVYS-1716-1,43.639

<font> Wel. <$$font> I am glad to find you so generous a Lover ;

<font> Wel. <$$font> It is so very lucky , that I do@ @n't understand
one Word on@ @'t . DAVYS-1716-1,43.652

<font> Gam. <$$font> Why then I@ @'ll tell you ; DAVYS-1716-1,43.653

<font> Isabella <$$font> , I suppose , has taken it into her Head to
grow jealous of her own Fortune , DAVYS-1716-1,43.654

and , doubtless , fancies I like it better than her ; upon which she has
contriv'd this Letter <paren> for it is her own Hand-Writing <$$paren>

<font> Wel. <$$font> If you are sure it is her Hand , it must be so ;
DAVYS-1716-1,43.656

and then , as you say , the Discovery is lucky enough .

Yes , yes , her Hand , I am sure it is her Hand . DAVYS-1716-1,43.661

Behaviour , bid me act with Circumspection , and let Love and Honour be

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Why , Child , I wou'd have you to make your

Misfortunes are very <P_44> common to the Inhabiters of this World ;
DAVYS-1716-1,44.675

mercenary . DAVYS-1716-1,44.680

And , Madam , tho' while my Father lives , I have not an Estate that can
deserve you , yet if you can confine your self to my present
Circumstances I@ @'ll make you as happy as I can now , and be doubly

<font> Isa. aside . <$$font> This is better than I expected .
DAVYS-1716-1,44.682

No , Mr. <font> Gamont <$$font> , it would be a Pity to involve you in

I@ @'ll e'en content my self with a private single Life ,

DAVYS-1716-1,45.722

it would vex me to my Heart to have him lose for want of looking after .

DAVYS-1716-1,50.899

<font> Capt. <$$font> No , I had no Time to ask her .

well with Bumpers , 'till they began to grow careless ,

then tipp'd the Wink upon <font> Miss <$$font> to follow me , which she
did to the other End of the Booth ; DAVYS-1716-1,50.904
