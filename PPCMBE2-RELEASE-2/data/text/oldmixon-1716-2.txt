The Life of the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,9.3

Tho' some Sublime Genius's , who think every Thing they do or say has
its Importance , will bear nothing done or said by others , but what is
Important , and despise the <font> Minutiae <$$font> of Great Men's
Lives ; yet we are satisfy'd the much greater , and perhaps the more
reasonable Part of Mankind are as well pleas'd , with the Relation of
the <font> Beginnings <$$font> , as with that of the <font> Ends
<$$font> of the Lives of Illustrious <font> Heroes <$$font> and <font>
Statesmen <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,9.4

For this Reason it is , that we lament the want of <font> Memoirs
<$$font> of the <font> Life <$$font> of my Lord <font> Somers <$$font>
from his Youth to his Manhood . OLDMIXON-1716-2,9.5

All that we have been able to learn in the short space of Time from his
Death till now , is , That he was the Son of Mr. <font> John Somers
<$$font> of the City of <font> Worcester <$$font> , Attorney_at_Law , by
Mrs. <font> Catherine Ceaverne <$$font> , a <font> Shropshire <$$font>
Gentlewoman . OLDMIXON-1716-2,9.6

The Grandfather of Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> was a Citizen of <font>
Worcester <$$font> , of good Substance ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,9.7

<P_10>

and Mrs. <font> Ceaverne <$$font> 's Ancestors were none of the meanest
of the <font> Shropshire <$$font> Gentry . OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.9

Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> , the Subject of this History , was Born in
the Year 1652 , OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.10

and being prepar'd for Grammar Learning , was put to the College School
in the City of <font> Worcester <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.11

I have not heard to what University he was afterwards sent ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.12

but am inform'd , by good Hands , his Contemporaries , that he was
esteem'd the most forward Youth in the <font> School <$$font> , and was
soon taken Notice of for the Quickness of his Wit , and the Soundness of
Judgment . OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.13

Before he settled at the Inns of Court , he serv'd a Clerkship with Sir
<font> Francis Winnington <$$font> , who , from being a Servitor in
<font> Trinity-College <$$font> , had rais'd a great Estate by the Law ,
tho' his Talent consisted rather in speaking fluently , than in sepeking
Eloquently , and he knew how to Wrangle , better than how to Argue ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.14

but it was his usual Saying , the <font> Lawyers get Money <$$font> ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.15

and on that Account , he always spake well of his Profession .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.16

Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> , after his Clearkship was ended , follow'd
his Studies with great Application and Success in the <font>
Middle-Temple <$$font> , living in great Intimacy with Mr. <font> Jekyl
<$$font> , who from his Friend became his Brother-in-Law .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.17

Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> 's Father us'd to frequent the Terms at
<font> London <$$font> , OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.18

and in his Way from <font> Worcester <$$font> , was wont to leave his
Horse at the <font> George <$$font> at <font> Acton <$$font> , where he
often made Mention of the hopeful Son he had at the <font> Temple
<$$font> , especially when he was call'd to the Bar .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.19

<font> Cobbet <$$font> , who kept the Inn , hearing him enlarge so much
in Praise of his Son , to compliment the Old Gentleman , cry'd , <font>
Why wo@ @n't you let us see him , Sir ? <$$font> OLDMIXON-1716-2,10.20

The Father , to oblige his Merry Landlord , took an Opportunity to
desire the Young Gentleman <P_11> to accompany him so far on his Way ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.21

and Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> being come to the <font> George <$$font>
, took his Landlord aside , OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.22

and said , <font> I have brought him <$$font> , Cobbet ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.23

<font> but you must not talk to him as you do to me ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.24

he will not suffer such Fellows as you in his Company <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.25

As mean as this Incident is , I wish I had more such , as well attested
. OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.26

They wou'd certainly add to the Reader's Pleasure , whatever they might
do to his Instruction ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.27

and as 't@ @is the Duty of all Writers to study to please , as well as
to instruct , I do not think any Particular of a Great Man's Life too
trifling to be reported . OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.28

While Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> was at the <font> Temple <$$font> , he
vary'd his Studies , OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.29

and did not spoil the Fineness of his Taste , by confining them to such
dry Reading , as is that of Law . OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.30

He was conversant with all Parts of Polite Literature ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.31

and particularly took great Delight in <font> Poetry <$$font> and <font>
History <$$font> ; in both which t@ @is evident by what he has left us ,
that he wou'd have perform'd with the greatest Excellence , had he not
been diverted by Studies of more Use to the Publick and to Himself .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.32

Besides many little Pieces in <font> Verse <$$font> , He translated the
Life of <font> Alcibiades <$$font> , in the <font> 2d <$$font> Volume of
<font> Plutarch <$$font> 's Lives , and the Epistle of <font> Ariadne
<$$font> to <font> Theseus <$$font> , in the Translation of <font> Ovid
<$$font> 's Epistles , both publish'd by Mr. <font> Tonson <$$font> ,
who had the Honour of being intimate with him when he was a young
Barrister {TEXT:Barister} . OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.33

I doubt not the Reader will be entertain'd with some Poetical Sketches
of Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> 's , taken out of those Two Performances
, both in Blank Verse , and in Rhime . OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.34

I shall begin with a Translation of some Verses of <font> Archippus
<$$font> on the Son of <font> Alcibiades <$$font> , who vainly affected
to Lisp like his Father , as well as to live like him .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,11.35

<P_12>

{COM:verse_omitted}

And then speaking of <font> Alcibiades <$$font> 's Victory
{TEXT:missing_"Victory"} at the <font> Olympick_Games <$$font>
{COM:font_change_around_"Olympick"} , he Translates the Original thus ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,12.38

{COM:translation_and_verse_omitted}

If we were to compare this Translation with our Modern <font>
Translators <$$font> of Heroick Poems , Men who profess no other <font>
Art <$$font> , we shou'd soon see by <P_13> the Comparison , how little
they are Masters of that of <font> Poetry <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,13.40

What can be more Easy , more Musical ? What Truth , what Harmony ?
OLDMIXON-1716-2,13.41

We have the whole Spirit of <font> Euripides <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,13.42

The Translator of <font> Plutarch <$$font> giving us a Passage out of
<font> Plato <$$font> , the Comick Poet , renders it thus :
OLDMIXON-1716-2,13.43

It relates to the Banishment of <font> Hyperbolus <$$font> , an Ordinary
Citizen {TEXT:City} of <font> Athens <$$font> , by <font> Ostracism
<$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,13.44

{COM:verse_omitted}

<font> Aristophanes <$$font> 's Saying of the Love of the <font>
Athenians <$$font> to <font> Alcibiades <$$font> .

And the same Author's Verses on their Jealousy . OLDMIXON-1716-2,13.48

<P_14>

As much Pleasure as I take in repeating any Part of the Works of this
Noble Peer and Patriot , I must remember 't@ @is a sort of Digression
from my Subject , which is the History of his Life ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,14.55

and I shall therefore content my_self with the following Instance of his
Mastership in the Art of Poetry ; being a few Lines out of his
Translation of <font> Ovid <$$font> 's Epistle of <font> Ariadne
<$$font> to <font> Theseus <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,14.56

{COM:verse_omitted}

Tho' Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> was young , when he diverted himself
with these <font> Translations <$$font> , yet by the <font> Excellence
<$$font> of his Performance , we may assure our_selves that he cou'd
perform , both in Poetry and History , to the greatest Perfection ; and
that his Oratory was not confin'd to the <font> Bar <$$font> , or the
<font> Bench <$$font> , where a Graceful Mien {TEXT:Mein} , and
Readiness <P_15> of Expression , have supply'd the Place of Eloquence in
the most Famous Lawyers and Judges . OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.58

Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> apply'd himself also to the Study of the
Civil Law , OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.59

and became a great Proficient in it . OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.60

'T@ @is the general Belief , that the Bishops Trial , was the first
Occasion of his distinguishing himself at the <font> Bar <$$font> ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.61

but it is certain , he was in many considerable Causes , some Years
before the Trial of the Bishops ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.62

particularly I find him one of the Counsel for the Gentlemen , who were
try'd for a Riot in the City at the chusing of the Sheriffs , in the
Year 1682 ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.63

the Persons accus'd , were <font> Thomas Pilkington <$$font> , Esq;
{COM:sic_here_and_passim} <font> Samuel Shute <$$font> , Esq; <font>
Henry Cornish <$$font> , Esq; <font> Ford <$$font> Lord <font> Gray
<$$font> , Sir <font> Thomas Player <$$font> , Mr. <font> John Jekyl
<$$font> , Sen. Father of Sir <font> Joseph Jekyl <$$font> , and
several more Worthy and Wealthy Citizens and Gentlemen .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.64

Their Councel were Mr. <font> Holt <$$font> , Mr. <font> Thompson
<$$font> , Mr. <font> Williams <$$font> , Sir <font> Francis Winnington
<$$font> , Mr. <font> Wallop <$$font> , Mr. <font> Freke <$$font> ,
and Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.65

They were try'd the 24th of <font> June <$$font> , 1683 .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.66

And notwithstanding the Learned Arguments of these Lawyers , the Chiefs
of their Profession , the Jury , among whom were Sir <font> Benjamin
Newland <$$font> , Sir <font> Edmund Wiseman <$$font> , <font> Thomas
Blackmore <$$font> , Percival Gilburn <$$font> , &c. found the
Gentlemen and Citizens Guilty , OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.67

and they had heavy Fines laid upon them . OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.68

From this Time Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> 's Practice increas'd Daily ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.69

and it is said he got Seven_Hundred Pounds a Year by it , in King <font>
James <$$font> the IId@ @'s Reign . OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.70

He inherited a good Estate , after the Death of his Father ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,15.71

and was look'd upon as one of the most rising Councel in <font> England
<$$font> , before he appear'd at the Trial of the Bishops , with Sir
<font> Francis Pemberton <$$font> , Sir <font> Robert Sawyer <$$font> ,
<font> Heneage Finch <$$font> , Esq; Serjeant <font> Levintz <$$font> ,
<P_16> and other Lawyers , the most Eminent of their Time :
OLDMIXON-1716-2,16.72

Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> was the last that spoke , as if he was to
crown all that had been said in Behalf of the Bishops , with his
Superior Learning and Eloquence , against the <font> Dispensing Power
<$$font> , much insisted upon by Sir <font> Thomas Powis <$$font> , Sir
<font> Bartholomew Shower <$$font> , and other <font> Staunch Churchmen
<$$font> , against the Bishops . OLDMIXON-1716-2,16.73

" Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> mention'd the Case of <font> Thomas
<$$font> and <font> Sorrel <$$font> , in the <font> Exchequer-Chamber
<$$font> , upon the Validity of the Dispensation of the Statute of
<font> Edward <$$font> the VIth , touching selling of Wine ; urging ,
that there it was the Opinion of every one of the Judges , that there
never could be an Abrogation , or a Suspension <paren> which is a
temporary Abrogation <$$paren> of an Act of Parliament , but by the
Legislative Power : That indeed it was disputed , how far the King might
dispense with the Penalties in such a particular Law , as to particular
Persons ; but it was agreed by all , that the King had no Power to
suspend any Law , of which there could be no Dispensation , but by an
Act of Parliament . That by the Laws of all civiliz'd Nations , if the
Prince does require something to be done , which the Person who is to do
it , takes to be unlawful , it is not only lawful , but his Duty ,
<font> Rescribere Principi <$$font> ; which is all the Bishops had done
here , and that in the most humble Manner . That the Matter of Fact
alledg'd in the Bishops' {TEXT:Bishop's} Petition , had been prov'd
perfectly true , by the Journals of both Houses ; that there could be no
Design to diminish the Prerogative by it , because the King has <P_17>
no such Prerogative : That the Petition could not be <font> Seditious
<$$font> , because it was presented to the King in private , and alone :
Nor <font> False <$$font> , because the Matter of it was true : Nor
<font> Malicious <$$font> , for the Occasion was not sought , the Thing
was prest upon them : Nor in short , a <font> Libel <$$font> , because
the Intent was innocent , and they kept within the Bounds set by the Act
of Parliament , that gives the Subject Leave to apply to his Prince , by
Petition , when he is aggriev'd . " OLDMIXON-1716-2,17.74

What Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> urg'd in this short , but very just
Argument , made more than ordinary Impression on the Jury ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,17.75

and was more taken Notice of , than the Arguments of the Elder Counsel ,
who pleaded the Bishops Cause before him . OLDMIXON-1716-2,17.76

His Reputation increas'd daily ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,17.77

and when the Prince of <font> Orange <$$font> Landed , Mr. <font>
Somers <$$font> was become one of the most Noted and Popular Lawyers in
<font> Westminster-Hall <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,17.78

It was impossible but a Man of his Learning , Sense and Judgment , must
have right Notions in Politicks , and abhor all Measures that tended to
the enslaving his Country . OLDMIXON-1716-2,17.79

His future Conduct shew'd , that he was as well acquainted with the
Politicians , as with the Poets and Historians ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,17.80

and such a Man could not avoid being plac'd in the most Eminent Stations
of the Law , when our Law , as well as Religion , was deliver'd from the
Tyranny of King <font> James <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,17.81

In the Convention which met by the Prince of <font> Orange <$$font> 's
Summons , the 22d of <font> January <$$font> 1688 . <font> John Somers
<$$font> , Esq; represented his Native City of <font> Worcester <$$font>
; OLDMIXON-1716-2,17.82

and a Difference arising about the Word <font> Abdicated <$$font> ,
between the House of Lords and House of Commons , Mr. <font> Somers
<$$font> was one of the <P_18> <font> Managers <$$font> for the Commons
, at the free Conference with the Lords . OLDMIXON-1716-2,18.83

Their Lordships had amended the Commons Vote , and put <font> Deserted
<$$font> in the Room of it ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,18.84

Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> was the Second Member of the House of
Commons , that spoke at the Conference ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,18.85

and how much the House depended on him for maintaining their strong Term
<font> Abdicated <$$font> , may be seen by his Speech , which is as
follows . OLDMIXON-1716-2,18.86

{COM:speech_omitted}

<P_23>

It appears by this Speech , that Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> had dipt
deep in the <font> Civil Law <$$font> , OLDMIXON-1716-2,23.89

and in the Course of the Conference , we find that the Earl of <font>
Clarendon <$$font> , and the Earl of <font> Nottingham <$$font> , took a
great deal of Pains to answer what he had urg'd out of the <font>
Civilians <$$font> to Support the Word <font> Abdicate <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,23.90

The Earl of <font> Clarendon <$$font> calls him the <font> Learned and
Ingenious Mr. Somers <$$font> , OLDMIXON-1716-2,23.91

and the Earl of <font> Nottingham <$$font> acknowledges , that he had
fully made out the Signification of the Word <font> Abdicate <$$font> ,
in the Civil Law ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,23.92

but insisting upon it that it was a Word not known to the Common Law ,
Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> reply'd to this ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,23.93

{COM:reply_omitted}

<P_25>

To this , Two Brothers , the Earls of <font> Rochester <$$font> , and
<font> Clarendon <$$font> , made some Reply ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,25.96

but the Force of Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> , and the rest of the
Managers {COM:missing_apostrophe} Reasons , was such , that the Lords
agreed to pass the Vote of the <font> Commons <$$font> , as they sent it
up , OLDMIXON-1716-2,25.97

and the Word <font> Abdicated <$$font> made way for the filling the
Throne with their Majesties King <font> William <$$font> and Queen
<font> Mary <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,25.98

Soon after their Accession to it , Mr. <font> Somers <$$font> was made
Sollicitor-General , and Knighted . OLDMIXON-1716-2,25.99

While he was in this Post , he had some Thoughts of Marrying ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,25.100

and made his Addresses to a young Lady , Mrs. <font> Anne Bawdon
<$$font> , Daughter of Sir <font> John Bawdon <$$font> , an Alderman of
<font> London <$$font> ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,25.101

he went so far in it , as to deliver a <font> Rental <$$font> of his
Estate , towards making a Settlement , OLDMIXON-1716-2,25.102

and had several Meetings with the young Lady's Friends to treat of it ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,25.103

but the Treaty broke off , on Account of a Difference about the Marriage
Portion and Settlement , to the great Regret of the young Lady
afterwards , when she found , that in Two Years Time he was Lord Keeper
of the Great Seal of <font> England <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,25.104

<P_26>

Upon the Death of Sir <font> Henry Pollexfen <$$font> ,
Lord_Chief-Justice of the <font> Common-Pleas <$$font> , Sir <font>
George Treby <$$font> was advanc'd to that Station ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,26.106

and Sir <font> John Somers <$$font> was made Attorney-General in his
Place , being succeeded in that of Sollicitor , by <font> Thomas Trevor
<$$font> , Esq; now Lord <font> Trevor <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,26.107

While he was <font> Sollictor-General <$$font> , came on the Trials of
the Lord <font> Preston <$$font> , Mr. <font> Ashton <$$font> , and Mr.
<font> Elliot <$$font> , for High-Treason ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,26.108

and when the Lord <font> Preston <$$font> was brought to his Trial at
the <font> Old-@ @Bailey <$$font> , before the Lord_Chief-Justice <font>
Holt <$$font> , the 17th of <font> January <$$font> , 1690 , he pleaded
his <font> Peerage <$$font> ; to which Sir <font> John Somers <$$font>
reply'd , {COM:reply_omitted} OLDMIXON-1716-2,26.109

<P_28>

My Lord <font> Preston <$$font> demanding Copies of his Indictment , by
Virtue of the Statute of 46 <font> Edward <$$font> III. Sir <font> John
Somers <$$font> said , " My Lord , this Statute that my Lord <font>
Preston <$$font> mentions , the 46 of <font> Edw. <$$font> III. is
printed at large in the Preface to my Lord <font> Coke <$$font> 's 3d
Report ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.111

and has been insisted upon in several Cases in the <font> King's Bench
<$$font> , where the Prisoner has desired a Copy of his Indictment ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.112

but a Copy has always been denied , OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.113

and this Statute has been taken to extend only to Records , which may be
Evidence for the Subject . " OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.114

And when the Prisoner desir'd longer Time to provide for his Defence ,
Mr. <font> Sollicitor-General <$$font> reply'd , " My Lord , there has
been all the Care taken that the Nature of the Thing was capable of , to
prevent any complaint of this kind . OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.115

Order was given , that my Lord and these Gentlemen should have notice as
early as was possible . OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.116

As soon as ever Mr. Attorney-General had had an Opportunity in looking
into the Evidence , notice was given them , that they should be Tryed ,
and that this was the day appointed for their Tryal .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.117

But there shall be no contending in a Matter of this Nature , for a day
. OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.118

If it be desired , and the Court please to put it off till to-morrow ,
we are contented , OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.119

but there can be no reason to put it off for a longer Time .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.120

As there is always a Tenderness to be used , and I know will be , and as
far as I am concerned , always shall be towards Persons in these
Circumstances , so there is a Regard to be had towards the Government
and the Publick . OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.121

I am sure , if the Accusation that is against these Gentlemen is true ,
the Government is highly concerned , that this Matter should come to a
speedy Examination , and that Persons that enter into such Designs be
brought to Judgment : OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.122

The Charge in the Indictment is of such a Nature as draws very great
Consequences along with it , OLDMIXON-1716-2,28.123

it concerns no less than {TEXT:then} the Life of the King and Queen ,
the Destruction of the Fleet of the Kingdom , and the Invasion of the
Realm <P_29> by the Forces of a Declared Enemy . OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.124

These are the Things that the Prisoners are charged with ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.125

and certainly there ought to be no delay in the searching into such
Matters as these . OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.126

They have had a Week's {TEXT:Weeks} Notice of Tryal already ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.127

and for many Days of that Week at least , they have had as many Council
to assist them as they desired , OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.128

and all the solicitors that they had a mind to have had free access to
them , so that they have wanted no opportunity to prepare for their
Tryal that Men in their Circumstances could have .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.129

As to what has been said with relation to the Jury , the Law indulges
them in the Number of their peremptory Challenges , without being put to
shew Cause ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.130

and the Court hath granted them at the very instant of their Pleading ,
a Copy of the Pannel , OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.131

and there is a reasonable time between this and to_morrow for their
making such Enquiry into the Jury , as is justifiable and fit to be made
. OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.132

But if by time to look into the Jury , it be meant , that there may be a
time for tampering , that I am sure your tenderness of the Government
will not permit ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.133

you will take care as much that no such thing be done , as you will ,
that they should not be surprized . OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.134

If your Lordships are pleased , that the Tryal be put off till to_morrow
, we will be ready to_morrow to attend it . " OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.135

I shall wave what Sir <font> John Somers <$$font> says , about the
Exceptions to the Jury , and other Matters of less Importance , in the
beginning of the Trial , and insert his Speech at the opening of the
Charge . OLDMIXON-1716-2,29.136

<P_38>

This contains the whole Story of the Lord <font> Preston <$$font> 's
Treason , OLDMIXON-1716-2,38.139

and is told in a Manner , which shews the <font> Sollicitor-General
<$$font> was as great a Master of the Art of Narration , as of the
Science of the Law . OLDMIXON-1716-2,38.140

I shall not take Notice of the fair and exact Method of managing this
Trial by Mr. Sollicitor <font> Somers <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,38.141

There were Council for the King with him , Mr. <font> Knapp <$$font> ,
Sir <font> William Thompson <$$font> , Sir <font> John Tremayne <$$font>
; OLDMIXON-1716-2,38.142

and among the Witnesses , we find , the Duke of <font> Leeds <$$font> ,
the Earl of <font> Nottingham <$$font> , and the Earl of <font> Rumney
<$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,38.143

At the Trial of <font> Ashton <$$font> , Two Days after , Sir <font>
John Somers <$$font> was one of the Council for the King ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,38.144

but he spoke little , having borne {TEXT:born} the greatest Part of the
Fatigue of the Lord <font> Preston <$$font> 's Trial , which was very
long . OLDMIXON-1716-2,38.145

The other Council in <font> Ashton <$$font> 's Trial , were Sir <font>
William Thompson <$$font> , Sir <font> William Williams <$$font> , Sir
<font> John Tremaine <$$font> , Mr. <font> Trevor <$$font> , and Mr.
<font> Knapp <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,38.146

I have mention'd nothing <P_39> out of these Trials but what is Material
, and has particular Relation to Sir <font> John Somers <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.147

Sir <font> Henry Pollexfen <$$font> , Lord_Chief_Justice of the <font>
Common Pleas <$$font> , dying in the Year 1691 . Sir <font> George
Treby <$$font> succeeded him in that Station , OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.148

and Sir <font> John Somers <$$font> succeeded Sir <font> George <$$font>
as Attorney-General . OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.149

A new Parliament open'd their Session the <font> 6th
{COM:font_change_excludes_numeral} <$$font> of <font> March <$$font>
1692 . OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.150

and Sir <font> John Somers <$$font> and <font> William Bromley <$$font>
, Esq; were again Chosen to Represent the City of <font> Worcester
<$$font> , OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.151

but he did not sit long in this House of Commons ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.152

for 16 Days after their first Meeting , His Majesty was pleas'd to
declare him Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <font> England <$$font> ,
to the general Satisfaction of all true Lovers of Justice , Liberty ,
and Learning . OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.153

Two Years after his Lordship's Advancement , Mr. <font> Edmund Gibson
<$$font> of Queens-College in <font> Oxford <$$font> , now the Right
Reverend the Bishop of <font> Lincoln <$$font> , publish'd <font>
Cambden <$$font> 's <font> Britannia <$$font> , in a new Version , and
with very large Additions . OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.154

This Work he dedicated to the Lord Keeper <font> Somers <$$font> ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.155

and in his Epistle says , <font> To whom then can our <$$font> Britannia
<font> address her_self with a better Assurance , than to your Lordship
, whose Life is one continu'd Zeal for her Honour and Happiness ?
OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.156

She@ @'s sensible of your Favours , OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.157

and in return has pickt up these Rarities of Art and Nature for a
Present to your Lordship . OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.158

They are the Choice of her whole Stock , OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.159

and she hopes there may be something in them to divert you in that
Multitude of Business , wherein you are daily engag'd for her Peace and
Preservation . OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.160

But if there should not , she@ @'s sure , however , by disposing thus of
her Treasure to lay an universal Obligation upon her Sons .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,39.161

She <P_40> still remembers how they all blest you for your Defence of
her distressed Prelates , and how , upon your Lordhip's Advancement , a
general Joy ran through her whole Family : But that a more particular
Satisfaction appear'd among the Learned , to see the Honour conferr'd
upon a Leading Member of their own Body . OLDMIXON-1716-2,40.162

She was pleas'd to hear them say , that by such Promotions , they , as
well as their Neighbours might at last have their <$$font> Richlieus
<font> and <$$font> Colberts . OLDMIXON-1716-2,40.163

I take no part of this Address , but what has particular Relation to his
Lordship's {TEXT:Lordships} Character , which brighten'd more and more
daily , as he sat on the first Bench of Justice in the Nation .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,40.164

The Equity of his Decrees ; the Politness of his Manners ; the Variety
and Extent of his Learning ; his Zeal for the Service of his King and
Country , were common Topicks for Discourse , while the Seals were in
his Custody . OLDMIXON-1716-2,40.165

Nor was he one of those Keepers of them , whose Knowledge , and whose
Eloquence , were confin'd to the Bar , and in all whose <font> Harangues
<$$font> the <font> Lawyer <$$font> was always predominant .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,40.166

King <font> William <$$font> consulted no Man so much as him , on all
the arduous Affairs of the State . OLDMIXON-1716-2,40.167

No Man in <font> Great-Britain <$$font> , knew so well as he , the
Interests of Foreign Kingdoms , and Commonwealths ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,40.168

nor cou'd so well compare that of his own Country with theirs .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,40.169

It was a Study , in which he took Pleasure to spend great Part of his
Leisure Hours , OLDMIXON-1716-2,40.170

and arriv'd to that Skill in it , as made his Counsel not only useful ,
but necessary , in all the most important Incidents of Government .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,40.171

As I am no Judge of his Decisions in the Law , so I shall not digress
too far from his History on that Account . OLDMIXON-1716-2,40.172

'T@ @is sufficent to observe , that however the People of <font> England
<$$font> <P_41> differ'd in other Matters , they all agreed in this ,
that my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> did as much Honour to the high
Station he was in , as he receiv'd from it . OLDMIXON-1716-2,41.173

In the Year 1695 , on the 15th of <font> June <$$font> , he was
appointed one of the Lords Justices of <font> England <$$font> , during
his Majesty's Absence in the Campaign of <font> Namur <$$font> , so
glorious to the Memory of King <font> William <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,41.174

It was in this Year , that the Earl of <font> Bellamont <$$font>
inform'd his Lordship , of the great Spoil committed by some Pirates in
the <font> West_Indies <$$font> , and represented the absolute Necessity
of redressing them . OLDMIXON-1716-2,41.175

The Lord Keeper communicated it to the King , who commanded the Lords of
the Admiralty to examine the Affair , and provide a Ship for the Service
. OLDMIXON-1716-2,41.176

But that Board declaring there was not one to be spar'd , rather than
such a necessary Service shou'd be lost , the Lord Keeper consented to
be a part of the Charge of fitting out a Ship on Purpose : Which
generous and publick-spirited Act , was afterwards made an Article
against him . OLDMIXON-1716-2,41.177

This Year he was made one of the Trustees , or Commissioners for <font>
Greenwich-Hospital <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,41.178

On the first of <font> May <$$font> , 1969 , the King did him the same
Honour as the Year before , OLDMIXON-1716-2,41.179

and appointed him one of the Lords Justices , whom he then declar'd in
Council . OLDMIXON-1716-2,41.180

In the following Year , 1697 , he was again appointed one of the
Lords-Justices . OLDMIXON-1716-2,41.181

His Majesty also created him L=d= <font> Somers <$$font> , Baron of
<font> Evesham <$$font> , and Lord High-Chancellor of <font> England
<$$font> , the 22d of <font> April <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,41.182

For the Support of these Honours and Dignities , King <font> William
<$$font> was pleas'd to make his Lordship a Grant of the Manors of
<font> Reygate <$$font> and <font> Howlegh <$$font> , in the County
<P_42> of <font> Surrey <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,42.183

These Manors formerly belong'd to the Lord <font> Munson <$$font> , who
forfeited them for the siding with <font> Cromwell <$$font> and being
concern'd in the Death of King <font> Charles <$$font> I .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,42.184

After the <font> Restoration <$$font> , they were given to the Duke of
<font> York <$$font> ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,42.185

and he having fairly forfeited them by his <font> Abdication <$$font> ,
they remain'd to the Crown . OLDMIXON-1716-2,42.186

The Yearly Value of both of them , is not above 600 <font> l. <$$font>
a Year . OLDMIXON-1716-2,42.187

The Grant was made to <font> Joseph Jekyll <$$font> , Esq; in Trust for
his Lordship , who by this Means came to have great Influence on the
Election of Members of Parliament for that Borough ; where , before this
, Sir <font> John Parsons <$$font> , a Brewer of <font> London <$$font>
, us'd to make himself , and Son , and whom he pleas'd , their
Representatives . OLDMIXON-1716-2,42.188

After my Lord was possess'd of it , his Friend , <font> Stephen Harvey
<$$font> , Esq; whose Translations of the Passion of <font> Byblis
<$$font> , and a Satyr of <font> Juvenal <$$font> , made him talk'd of
among others of Mr. <font> Tonson <$$font> 's Authors , was always
chosen , but not without great Opposition from the Neighbouring Gentry ,
insomuch that several of his Lordship's Friends in Town , became
Freeholders in his Manor , as Mr. <font> Congreve <$$font> , Mr.
<font> Tonson <$$font> , and others , to strengthen that Interest
against the Riotous Expences , and Factious Cabals of his numerous
Opponents . OLDMIXON-1716-2,42.189

But as Five or Six_Hundred Pounds a Year , was a poor Provision for a
Peer of <font> Great-Britain <$$font> , King <font> William <$$font> ,
by Virtue of his Prerogative , and according to the Practice of all his
Royal Predecessors , Kings of <font> England <$$font> , added other
Revenues belonging to the Crown , to the Manors of <font> Reygate
<$$font> and <font> Howlegh <$$font> , OLDMIXON-1716-2,42.190

and gave his Lordship a Grant , to the Value of Two_Thousand_One_Hundred
Pounds <font> per_Annum <$$font> , out of the Fee-Farm-Rents .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,42.191

The <P_43> Persons nam'd in Trust for his Lordship in that Grant , were
<font> Humphrey Hetherington <$$font> , Esq; <font> Richard Adney
<$$font> , Esq; <font> Samuel Newton <$$font> , Esq; <font> Leonard
Hancock <$$font> , of <font> Cheshunt <$$font> in <font> Hertfordshire
<$$font> , Esq; and Mr. <font> John Warner <$$font> , of <font> London
<$$font> , Goldsmith . OLDMIXON-1716-2,43.192

Nothing had been more common , and indeed nothing was more just , than
that the Sovereign , who is the Fountain of Honour , should have equal
Power to Enrich , as well as to Ennoble ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,43.193

for Nobility without Estate , is rather a Curse than a Blessing ; a
Punishment than a Reward : OLDMIXON-1716-2,43.194

Yet the <font> Enemies <$$font> of his Lordship's Merit , made this also
an Article in their unjust Charge against him , Four Years after .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,43.195

If his Lordship had a Pension of Four_Thousand Pounds a Year , several
of his Predecessors had the same . OLDMIXON-1716-2,43.196

His Practice , when Attorney-General , could not amount to much less .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,43.197

And as the Office of Lord Keeper is very Expensive and Precarious , and
as it has not been known , that a Lord-Keeper ever return'd to the Bar
again upon the Loss of his Office , it would be very hard , if the Crown
might not make Amends to those great Men that serve it , for whatever
Interests they part with , in undertaking that Service .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,43.198

In the Year 1698 , his Lordship was , on the 16th of <font> July
<$$font> , again Nam'd one of the Lords-Justices , in the Absence of the
King Abroad . OLDMIXON-1716-2,43.199

Before his Majesty went to <font> Holland <$$font> , he communicated to
my Lord Chancellor , a Proposition made by Count <font> Tallard <$$font>
, to prevent a War , about the Succession of <font> Spain <$$font> ,
upon the Death of the then feeble King of that Kingdom .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,43.200

The Lord <font> Somers <$$font> 's constant Application to the Affairs
of his Office , and of the State , had <P_44> contributed very much to
the weakning , and the Decay of this Constitution ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,44.201

and his Health was now mightily impair'd : OLDMIXON-1716-2,44.202

For the Recovery of it , he desir'd Leave of his Majesty , before he
left <font> England <$$font> , to go to <font> Tunbridge <$$font> ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,44.203

and he was drinking the Waters there , when he receiv'd the following
Letter from the King in <font> Holland <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,44.204

{COM:letter_omitted}

<P_45>

It must be own'd , this Great Prince had not a more faithful Friend ,
than my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> , as well as more Loyal Subject , or
more useful Servant . OLDMIXON-1716-2,45.207

This Letter shews , what an Opinion King <font> William <$$font> , who
knew Men as well as ever King did , had of my Lord's Merit , and
Affection to his Person . OLDMIXON-1716-2,45.208

In Obedience to his Majesty's Command , my Lord communicated the
Contents of it to the Duke of <font> Shrewsbury <$$font> , the Earl of
<font> Orford <$$font> , and Mr. <font> Montagu <$$font> , afterwards
Lord <font> Hallifax <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,45.209

The latter , and Mr. <font> Vernon <$$font> , went to <font> Tunbridge
<$$font> to his Lordship , where they very seriously consider'd , and
debated the Contents of the Letter . OLDMIXON-1716-2,45.210

As great a Clamour as the <font> Treaty of Partition <$$font> made ,
when one reflects on the Superiority of the Power of <font> France
<$$font> at that Time , over all the Powers of <font> Christendom
<$$font> , and the dangerous Condition the King of <font> Spain <$$font>
's Life was in , one can@ @not but highly approve of the Measures that
were taken to prevent his Kingdoms falling entirely to a <font> Bourbon
<$$font> Prince . OLDMIXON-1716-2,45.211

And had <font> Charles <$$font> II. of <font> Spain <$$font> , dy'd in
<font> October <$$font> , as his Majesty apprehended he would , before
the <font> French <$$font> had corrupted the Court of <font> Madrid
<$$font> by their Bribes , and Misrepresentations , this Treaty would
have been the best Security which <font> Europe <$$font> would have had
, for the Preservation of <P_46> the <font> Balance of Power <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,46.212

<font> Charles <$$font> II. of <font> Spain <$$font> , had then made no
Will , OLDMIXON-1716-2,46.213

and the <font> French <$$font> King cou'd have had no Pretence to have
evaded this <font> Treaty <$$font> , by distinguishing between the
<font> Sense <$$font> , and the <font> Letter <$$font> of it .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,46.214

My Lord <font> Somers <$$font> having maturely consider'd the Matter
with his Friends , return'd his Majesty the following Answer to the
Letter , he had the Honour to receive from him . OLDMIXON-1716-2,46.215

{COM:body_of_letter_omitted}

The rest of the Letter is in the Answer to the first Article of the
Impeachment against his Lordship , From <font> First , That the
Entertainment of such a Proposal , to make further Advantages of their
Success <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,46.217

The Close is , <P_47> {COM:closing_of_letter_omitted}
OLDMIXON-1716-2,47.218

Notwithstanding that his Lordship acted with so much Caution in this
Critical Affair , and was sufficiently warranted to do what he did by
his Majesty's Command ; notwithstanding that his <font> Disobedience
<$$font> wou'd have been as Criminal , <P_48> as Insolent and Ungrateful
; yet did the Faction never cease clamouring against his Conduct , till
they had it examin'd in Parliament . OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.219

What Leisure his Lordship cou'd find amidst the Hurry of Publick Affairs
, he still spent in the Politer Studies . OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.220

All Men of Art and Merit were welcome to him ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.221

and he not only encourag'd but rewarded them . OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.222

Nor did he confine his Protection of Men of Letters to his Countrymen
only ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.223

Foreigners also shar'd of his Favour and Bounty , and Mr. <font> Le
Clerc <$$font> in particular . OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.224

About this Time , there was great Talk of Monsieur <font> Bayle <$$font>
's Great <font> Historical and Critical <$$font> Dictionary , as a Work
which was ready to be made Publick ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.225

and my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> had such a Character of it , that he
was desirous to do something for the Author . OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.226

Accordingly he wrote to a Friend in <font> Holland <$$font> , intimating
, that if Monsieur <font> Bayle <$$font> accepted of his Patronage for
his Dictionary , he had 150 Guineas at his Service .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.227

Mr. <font> Bayle <$$font> had been suspected of caballing with Persons
in the <font> French <$$font> Interest ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.228

and it was so far prov'd upon him , that King <font> William <$$font>
order'd him to be remov'd from his Professor's Place by the Magistracy
of <font> Rotterdam <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.229

This highly disgusted that Gentleman , OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.230

and on many Occasions he express'd his Resentment against King <font>
William <$$font> , but in none more than this . OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.231

For when a Friend of his communicated to him my Lord's Generous
Disposition towards him , and represented how much it would be for his
Honour and Advantage , Mr. <font> Bayle <$$font> said , <font> It was
true , but he could not bring himself to pay that Compliment to a Lord ,
who was Minister to a Prince of whom he had Reason to complain <$$font>
. OLDMIXON-1716-2,48.232

That King <font> William <$$font> had <P_49> reason to complain of him ,
we may very well imagine , when he was so well with the <font> French
<$$font> Court , that Count <font> Guiscard <$$font> offer'd him 1000
Crowns a Year , and the Liberty of his Religion , if he would return to
<font> France <$$font> , and be Tutor to his Sons : The King having
given him Permission to do it . OLDMIXON-1716-2,49.233

In the following Year , 1699 . my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> was once
more declar'd one of the Lords Justices , on the 31st of <font> May
<$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,49.234

His Majesty thought necessary , on the Death of the Electoral Prince of
<font> Bavaria <$$font> , who by the first Partition Treaty was to have
succeeded to the greatest Part of the <font> Spanish <$$font> Monarchy ,
to enter into a second Treaty , in Conjunction with the States-General .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,49.235

By this Treaty , the <font> Dauphin <$$font> was to possess a small Part
of that Monarchy , to prevent a War for the whole .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,49.236

This Treaty was manag'd in <font> Holland <$$font> ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,49.237

and my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> knew nothing of it , till after it
was so far concluded , that no Alternation could be made to it , as the
Plenipotentiaries declar'd themselves . OLDMIXON-1716-2,49.238

A Draught of that Treaty being then read in Council , the Lord <font>
Somers <$$font> and others made several Objections ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,49.239

but were answer'd , <font> That 't@ @was too late <$$font> ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,49.240

and a Warrant coming to him , requiring him to affix the Great-Seal to
the Ratification of that Treaty , he was no longer at Liberty to dispute
the Matter . The Duty of his Office obliging him to pay ready Obedience
to his Majesty's Commands , in a Case which was his undoubted
Prerogative . OLDMIXON-1716-2,49.241

This Treaty rais'd a new Clamour , OLDMIXON-1716-2,49.242

and to it was added the Charge against his Lordship for his Concern in
<font> Kidd <$$font> 's Adventure . OLDMIXON-1716-2,49.243

'T@ @is not to be imagin'd how industrious the Faction was to spread
false Reports <P_50> on these Heads , to blacken , if possible , the
Lord <font> Somers <$$font> 's unblemished Reputation .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.244

As easy as 't@ @was to see thro' the Wicked Designs of his Enemies , yet
many were impos'd upon by their malicious Representation ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.245

and the Ferment wrought so high , that in <font> April <$$font> 1700 .
the Question was put in the House of Commons , <font> That an humble
Address be made to his Majesty , to remove <$$font> John <font> Lord
<$$font> Somers <font> from his Presence and Councils for ever <$$font>
; OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.246

but it was carry'd in the <font> Negative <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.247

However , the Party were not discourag'd : OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.248

They had set the Nation so much against the Ministry , on whom they laid
all the blame of the Taxes , that the King was made believe he shou'd
never be easy till he chang'd Hands . OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.249

The Lord <font> Somers <$$font> was of all the Ministry most Obnoxious
to the Faction , and for no other Account than because he was the most
Useful , the most Zealous , and the most Faithful to the Interest of the
King and Kingdom , of all the Ministers then employ'd .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.250

The Earl of <font> Albemarle <$$font> , who had supplanted the Lord
<font> Portland <$$font> in his Majesty's good Graces , gave in@ @to the
Project of the Change of the Ministry ; but not with the same Views as
the Party had . OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.251

That Earl did it to gain them over to his Master's Interest ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.252

but their Design was to weaken and perplex his Affairs .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.253

The Party having , by their false Glosses , and their fair Promises made
the Earl of <font> Albemarle <$$font> their Friend , he carry'd their
Representations as they were given him , to his Majesty ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.254

and the King , fond of every thing that promoted the necessary War he
resolv'd to engage in , at last comply'd with their Desires ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.255

and came to a Resolution to shift Hands . OLDMIXON-1716-2,50.256

The Earl of <font> Albemarle <$$font> <P_51> did not care to appear in
this Matter ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.257

and therefore His Majesty , in the beginning of 1700 . sent the Earl of
<font> Portland <$$font> to the Lord-Chancellor , to demand the Great
Seals of him . OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.258

His Lordship expected this Blow , OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.259

and was prepar'd to meet it with a Presence of Mind worthy the <font>
Dignity <$$font> from which he was falling . OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.260

He shew'd no manner of Concern on his own Account ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.261

but express'd some Regret on his Master's . OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.262

What Doctor <font> Kennet <$$font> says on this Subject , is very
Curious , OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.263

and I shall therefore insert {TEXT:inesert} it entire .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.264

" Whether His Majesty made this Step by his own Determination , or by
the Impulse of his new Favourite , who headed a growing Party ,
Histories can@ @not affirm ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.265

but t@ @is most certain , that thereby his Majesty lost abundance of
true Friends , without gaining any real ones . OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.266

For tho' the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> had been attack'd by the
Commons , yet the Majority of the House had warmly stood up in his
Defence ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.267

and as the abandoning so faithful a Minster could not but discourage
others from embracing heartily his Majesty's Service ; so his Majesty
yielding so tamely , <paren> if I may be allow'd the Expression in
speaking of a Prince who was a Heroe in the Field <$$paren> to the Faint
and Negative Resolves of the House of Commons , could not but lay him
open to more Vigorous Attacks . OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.268

Though his Removal displeased many , yet it seem'd not to affect his
Lordship , who retir'd with Content and Temper , and upon all Occasions
in Parliament serv'd the King and the Interest of the Publick , as if he
had not lost his Place . " OLDMIXON-1716-2,51.269

His Lordship's Character was so shining , that <P_52> the <font> Seals
<$$font> were said to <font> go a begging <$$font> , upon his parting
with them . OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.270

The brightest Men at the Bar despair'd of making any considerable Figure
after him . OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.271

They rightly judg'd , they should fall so far short of him in Genius ,
Experience , and Extent of Knowledge , that they shou'd lose more in
Reputation , than they should acquire in Fortune , by accepting them .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.272

And it is said , several of the most able Lawyers excus'd themselves ,
when they were offer'd to succeed him . OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.273

The Person that accepted that Offer , Sir <font> Nathan Wright <$$font>
, was , 't@ @is true , a good Lawyer ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.274

but having no great Qualities nor Endowments otherwise , being little
Conversant with the Affairs of State , or with Polite Literature , every
one foresaw that it would be more profitable than glorious to him , to
be my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> 's Successor . OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.275

His Lordship now gave himself up entirely to the Studies of History ,
Antiquities , and other Curious Parts of Learning .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.276

He took a particular Pleasure in <font> Prints <$$font> and <font>
Medals <$$font> , OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.277

and was a Masterly Judge of their Genuineness and Excellence .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.278

He also delighted himself in his Retirement , at his Seat near <font>
Cheshunt <$$font> in <font> Hertfordshire <$$font> ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.279

and the Sweets of Solitude , and the Muses , soon made more than Amends
for the Loss of the Fatigues and Honours of his Office of Chancellor .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.280

What was the Sense of the Honest and Reasonable Part of the Nation ,
with Reference to the Removal of the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> , will
be further seen by the following Paragraph taken out of a Treatise
publish'd soon after , and written by a very Intelligent Author .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,52.281

He is speaking of the Faction who rais'd the Clamour <P_53> against his
Lordship , and continu'd it , till they procur'd his <font> Impeachment
<$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,53.282

" They will appear , <font> says he <$$font> , to have no Friendship to
the King's Interest , and to carry on Purposes destructive to the Nation
. OLDMIXON-1716-2,53.283

This Proposition may be explain'd to us in that one Instance of the late
Lord Chancellor . OLDMIXON-1716-2,53.284

The King and People were equally happy , in the Justice , Integrity ,
and Excellent Abilities of that Noble Lord . OLDMIXON-1716-2,53.285

His Affection to the King , his Zeal for the Publick , and his Regard to
the Constitution , were Qualities that had fill'd his very Soul , and
enter'd the <font> Compositum <$$font> of his Being ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,53.286

and yet this Great Man was remov'd from the King's Ear , and Prince and
People depriv'd of his Assistance , at the only time when he might be
most useful . OLDMIXON-1716-2,53.287

The Smiles that were seen at St. <font> Germains <$$font> on this
Change , and the Delight our Adversaries took in it , are apparent Marks
, that this Jog to the Nation was manag'd by the Dark Intrigues of the
old Enemies of our Peace , tho' 't@ @is not difficult to trace it up to
the Contrivers . OLDMIXON-1716-2,53.288

It is well known , if that Noble Lord had left the Great Seal behind him
at <font> Hampton-Court <$$font> , they had prepar'd for us an <font>
Irish <$$font> Successor , whose Phiz and Conscience has no Simile , but
that of his Patrons . OLDMIXON-1716-2,53.289

Time , the Mother of Truth , will convince us , that the Removal of this
Noble Lord , was by the Advice and Counsel of false Friends , who have
no Mind to see <font> England <$$font> in such a good Disposition , that
it may be a Terror to our Enemies , and the Support and Comfort of our
Allies . " OLDMIXON-1716-2,53.290

<P_54>

The History of the last Reign is a sufficient Proof of the good Judgment
of this Author . OLDMIXON-1716-2,54.292

We shall there find this Noble Lord's Enemies advanc'd by their <font>
Dark Intrigues <$$font> , to the highest Stations , and doing all that
lay in their Power , to betray and ruin our <font> Allies <$$font> , and
to serve and strengthen our <font> Enemies <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,54.293

It is said by some , who were no Strangers to the Lord <font> Somers
<$$font> , that his Lordship represented to His Majesty at <font>
Hampton-Court <$$font> , that tho' he was very willing to resign the
Seals , and retire from Business ; yet being convinc'd , that those who
advis'd His Majesty to take them from him , did it with a View , rather
to serve themselves than the Government ; if His Majesty wou'd consent
that he shou'd continue in his Post , he doubted not to be able to
vindicate himself against all the Calumnies of his Enemies , and
maintain himself in it , with the Reputation due to his Zeal and
Integrity . OLDMIXON-1716-2,54.294

At this Time , the Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font> had insinuated
himself into Credit at Court , by representing to the King , that he
wou'd never be able to bring the <font> Church <$$font> Interest into a
War , unless the Ministry was chang'd : That if the Seals were taken
from the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> , the House of Commons wou'd be put
into a good Humour , and fall readily in with his Majesty's Measures .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,54.295

Sir <font> Edward Seymour <$$font> was in the same Tone ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,54.296

and the Speaker , Mr. <font> Harley <$$font> , who was also consulted
on this Occasion , gave the same Assurances . OLDMIXON-1716-2,54.297

The King found the Parliament so backward to enter into a War , without
which the Balance of Power , and the Liberties of <font> Europe <$$font>
had been immediately destroy'd , that he harken'd to their Counsels ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,54.298

but soon found they were as fatal as all Counsels had ever been to
<P_55> him , which came from that Quarter . OLDMIXON-1716-2,55.299

His Majesty on several Occasions express'd his entire Satisfaction in
the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> 's Ministry , and his Regret to part
with him , thro' the <font> Necessity of his Affairs <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,55.300

And the Faction observing , that both King and People were uneasy at his
<font> Removal <$$font> , resolv'd to push their Prejudice to a
Prosecution ; in hopes of accomplishing , by an Appearance of <font>
Justice <$$font> , what they found they could never effect by Scandal ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,55.301

and to this end , they set a-foot an <font> Impeachment <$$font> , which
serv'd only to shew their Malice , and his Lordship's Innocence .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,55.302

The first Step that was taken towards this <font> Impeachment <$$font> ,
was by an Address to the King , of the 15th of <font> February <$$font>
1700 . to have all the Treaties made since the late War , laid before
the House of Commons ; which was done by Mr. Secretary <font> Vernon
<$$font> the 4th of <font> March <$$font> ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,55.303

and those Treaties relating chiefly to the <font> Partition <$$font> of
the <font> Spanish <$$font> Monarchy , an Address was order'd by the
House of Commons , wherein among other Things it was mention'd , that
the Partition Treaty <font> was passed under the Great-Seal of <$$font>
England , <font> during the sitting of Parliament , and without the
Advice of the same <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,55.304

Sir <font> Edward Seymour <$$font> was Chairman of the Committee , who
drew up this <font> Address <$$font> ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,55.305

and 't@ @was plain , that it was done to prepare the way for censuring
the late Lord Chancellor's Conduct . OLDMIXON-1716-2,55.306

At the same time , the House of Lords also took those Treaties into
Consideration , OLDMIXON-1716-2,55.307

and appointed a Committee to draw up and state the Fact .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,55.308

This Committee were compos'd of the following Peers : <P_56> Duke of
<font> Devonshire <$$font> Duke of <font> Bolton <$$font> . Duke of
<font> Leeds <$$font> . Marquis of <font> Normanby <$$font> . Earl of
<font> Peterborough <$$font> . Earl of <font> Stamford <$$font> . Earl
of <font> Thanet <$$font> . Earl of <font> Kingston <$$font> . Earl of
<font> Burlington <$$font> . Earl of <font> Shaftsbury <$$font> . Earl
of <font> Nottingham <$$font> . Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font> .
Earl of <font> Abingdon <$$font> . Earl of <font> Marlborough <$$font>
. Earl of <font> Romney <$$font> . Earl of <font> Oxford <$$font> .
Viscount <font> Weymouth <$$font> . Viscount <font> Longueville
<$$font> . Lord <font> Willoughby <$$font> . Lord <font> La Warr
<$$font> . Lord <font> Ferrers <$$font> . Lord <font> Wharton <$$font>
. Lord <font> Mohun <$$font> . Lord <font> Colepeper <$$font> . Lord
<font> Lexington <$$font> . Lord <font> Berkley <$$font> . Lord <font>
Craven <$$font> . Lord <font> Guilford <$$font> . Lord <font>
Godolphin <$$font> . Lord <font> Cholmondeley <$$font> . Lord <font>
Herbert <$$font> . Lord <font> Hallifax <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,56.309

The Earl of <font> Nottingham {TEXT:Notingham} <$$font> was Chairman of
this Committee ; who drew up several Articles , some of which the House
did not agree to ; particularly the Seventh , <font> That the Treaty was
transacted and agreed , and the Great-Seal affix'd to it , during the
sitting of a Parliament <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,56.310

For this Article had an Eye to my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> , whom the
Lords did not think guilty of any Crime , and consequently would not
admit of any Expression which look'd like a Censure .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,56.311

However , the Commons went on with their Designs to Impeach all those
that had any Hand in the Partition-Treaty
{COM:font_change_around_"Partition"} , unless they had done something to
deserve the Favour of the Party . OLDMIXON-1716-2,56.312

For we shall find presently , that they were very Partial in their
<font> Impeachments <$$font> , and meddled only with such as had
distinguish'd themselves most by their Loyalty and Affection to their
King and Country . OLDMIXON-1716-2,56.313

<P_57>

The First they <font> impeach'd <$$font> was the Earl of <font> Portland
<$$font> , on the 1st of <font> April <$$font> 1701 .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,57.315

Sir <font> John Levison-Gower <$$font> carry'd up that <font>
Impeachment <$$font> to the Lords . OLDMIXON-1716-2,57.316

The same Day Mr. St. <font> John <$$font> was sent to desire a Free
Conference , <font> upon Matters relating to the Partition Treaty
<$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,57.317

The Marquis of <font> Normanby <$$font> manag'd it on the Part of the
Lords , and Colonel <font> Granville <$$font> on the Part of the Commons
; OLDMIXON-1716-2,57.318

at this Conference a Paper was shewn to the Commons , which the Earl of
<font> Portland <$$font> deliver'd to the Lords , concerning his
engaging in the Negotiation of that Treaty ; which Paper was as follows
: OLDMIXON-1716-2,57.319

{COM:paper_omitted}

When this Paper was deliver'd to the House of Lords , the Lord <font>
Somers <$$font> desir'd the Earl of <font> Portland <$$font> , with the
leave of the House , to declare , <font> Whether his Name was mention'd
in the Letter he received <P_58> from Mr. Secretary <$$font> Vernon ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,58.321

and the Earl of <font> Portland <$$font> declar'd ; <font> That if he
had remembered any such Thing in the Letter , and had not inserted it in
the Paper which he had deliver'd to the House , he should have thought
he had deceived the House <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,58.322

Notwithstanding this Declaration , and that the Lord <font> Somers
<$$font> had done no more than he was oblig'd to do by the Duty of his
Office : notwithstanding he had given his Majesty such excellent Advice
, and argu'd so well against the Partition of the <font> Spanish
<$$font> Monarchy ; yet the Party , who were resolv'd to ruin him ,
carry'd their Resentment so far , as to procure an Impeachment .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,58.323

The Debate concerning his Lordship , was on the 10th of <font> April
<$$font> 1701 . OLDMIXON-1716-2,58.324

and the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> hearing of it , went to the House of
Commons , OLDMIXON-1716-2,58.325

and desir'd he might be admitted ; which the House agreeing to , a Chair
was set by the Serjeant , a little within the Bar , on the Left Hand
coming in , OLDMIXON-1716-2,58.326

and the Door being open'd , his Lordship came in ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,58.327

and the Speaker , Mr. <font> Harley <$$font> , acquainted him , That he
might repose himself in the Chair provided for him ; which his Lordship
did , and made a most Elegant Speech , setting forth every Part of his
Conduct , with Respect to the Partition Treaty ; by which it appear'd ,
that all he did was in the Execution of his Office of Chancellor , and
by Express Command of the King , whose Command was his sufficient
Warrant , and the Prerogative of making Peace and War , of Treaties of
<font> Partition , Commerce <$$font> , and other Treaties so Essential
to the Crown , that he cou'd not refuse Obedience to his Master's Orders
, without justly incurring his Royal Displeasure .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,58.328

Of this <font> Prerogative <$$font> we <P_59> heard enough , when the
last Treaty with <font> France <$$font> was on Foot ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,59.329

and the very same Men who then clamour'd so much against the <font>
Treaty of Partition <$$font> , made a worse , after the Expence of Sixty
Millions , the gaining of Ten Battels , and the Conquest of 100 Towns ;
Which shews , that the Party had not in the least the Interest of their
Country at Heart ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,59.330

but knowing , that the Cry of not giving any Part of the Dominions of
<font> Spain <$$font> to the <font> French <$$font> was popular ; they
made use of it to destroy King <font> William <$$font> 's best Servants
and Friends : while they themselves meant nothing less than to give the
<font> French <$$font> the whole <font> Spanish <$$font> Monarchy :
OLDMIXON-1716-2,59.331

For as soon as <font> Lewis <$$font> XIV. broke the Partition Treaty ,
by accepting the <font> Will <$$font> of King <font> Charles <$$font>
II. and King <font> William <$$font> discover'd a Disposition to enter
into a War , to prevent his possessing himself of the Kingdoms belonging
to it , how did they bestir themselves to hinder that War ?
OLDMIXON-1716-2,59.332

What a Noise did they make against the Danger and Expence of it ?
OLDMIXON-1716-2,59.333

And afterwards , when in the following Reign , they saw it was like to
end in the Destruction of the <font> French <$$font> Power ; how did
they give up a Ten Years Glorious War , by a <font> scandalous <$$font>
and <font> ruinous <$$font> Peace ? OLDMIXON-1716-2,59.334

'T@ @was necessary to observe these Things , that we may know what sort
of Men we have to do with in the Prosecution of this Impeachment of the
Lord <font> Somers <$$font> ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,59.335

and by these Reflections we may be convinc'd , that they intended
nothing less than the Service of the Common Cause , by prosecuting those
that so resolutely espous'd and served {TEXT:serve} it afterwards .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,59.336

When his Lordship had ended his Speech , he deliver'd to the House , the
Letter he wrote to His Majesty , which is already mention'd <P_60> in
this Treatise , OLDMIXON-1716-2,60.337

and being withdrawn , They Resolv'd <font> That <$$font> John <font>
Lord <$$font> Somers , <font> by Advising His Majesty , in the Year
One_Thousand_Six_Hundred_Ninety_Eight , to the Treaty of the Partition
of the <$$font> Spanish <font> Monarchy , where Large Territories of the
King of <$$font> Spain <font> 's Dominions were to be deliver'd up to
<$$font> France , <font> is Guilty of a High Crime and Misdemeanor .
<$$font> OLDMIXON-1716-2,60.338

Now , in Truth , the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> did Advise the quite
contrary ; as appears by his Letter to King <font> William <$$font> ,
concerning the Partition ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,60.339

but no matter for that : OLDMIXON-1716-2,60.340

The Party insisted upon it , that to put the Seals to the Treaty , was
to <font> Advise it <$$font> ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,60.341

and on this Foot the Impeachment went on . OLDMIXON-1716-2,60.342

Resolv'd <font> That <$$font> John <font> Lord <$$font> Somers <font> be
impeach'd of High Crimes and Misdemeanors . <$$font>
OLDMIXON-1716-2,60.343

And the Person pitch'd upon to have his Name made immoral , for standing
at the Head of the <font> Impeachers <$$font> , was Mr. <font> Simon
Harcourt <$$font> , who was Chancellor when the Seals were put to the
Treaty , that gave the <font> Spanish <$$font> Monarchy to the Duke of
<font> Anjou <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,60.344

Order'd , <font> That Mr. <$$font> Harcourt <font> do go up to the
Lords , and at their Bar , in the Name of the House of Commons , and of
all the Commons of <$$font> England , <font> Impeach <$$font> John
<font> Lord <$$font> Somers <font> of High Crimes and Misdemeanors
<$$font> ; <P_61> <font> and acquaint them , that this House will in due
Time exhibit particular Articles against him , and make good the same .
<$$font> OLDMIXON-1716-2,61.345

Impeachments were also Voted against the Earl of <font> Orford <$$font>
, and the Lord <font> Hallifax <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,61.346

Col. <font> Byerly <$$font> carry'd up that against the Lord <font>
Orford <$$font> , and Mr. <font> Bruges <$$font> that against the Lord
<font> Hallifax <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,61.347

The next Day , the 15th of <font> April <$$font> , the House of Commons
Resolv'd , <font> That an Address be presented to his Majesty , that he
will be pleased to remove <$$font> John <font> Lord <$$font> Somers
<font> from His Council for ever . <$$font> OLDMIXON-1716-2,61.348

The same Votes pass'd against the Earls of <font> Portland <$$font> and
<font> Orford <$$font> , and the Lord <font> Hallifax <$$font> ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,61.349

and accordingly an Address to that purpose was presented the 22d of
<font> April <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,61.350

But no sooner did the House of Lords know of these Votes , than their
Lordships were pleas'd to come to the following Resolution : <font> That
an Address be made to his Majesty , That His Majesty will be pleased not
to pass any Censure or Punishment against the Four Noble Lords , who
stand impeach'd of High Crimes and Misdemeanors , until the Impeachment
depending against them in the House shall be tried . <$$font>
OLDMIXON-1716-2,61.351

The House of Commons appointed a Committee , to draw up Articles against
the impeach'd Lords . OLDMIXON-1716-2,61.352

Sir <font> Bartholomew Shower <$$font> was Chairman of it ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,61.353

and yet it was so difficult to find Matter for Articles , that the House
of Lords were forced to send Messages , to quicken the Commons in it ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,61.354

and upon this , Articles were exhibited first against the Earl of <font>
Orford <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,61.355

And upon another Message from the Lords to the Commons , to remind them
of their Impeachment <P_62> of the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> ,
Articles were brought up against him by Mr. <font> Harcourt <$$font> ,
the 19th of <font> May <$$font> , 1701 . OLDMIXON-1716-2,62.356

Three Days before this , the House of Commons , Resolv'd <font> That a
further Humble Address be presented to His Majesty , That he will be
graciously pleased to answer the Address of this House , for removing
<$$font> John <font> Lord <$$font> Somers , <font> &c. from his
Presence and Council for ever . <$$font> Which Address had no better
Success than the former ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,62.357

and one can@ @not imagine what else the Party could expect from it ,
considering , that the House of Lords had presented a contrary Address
to the King . OLDMIXON-1716-2,62.358

I shall not enter into the Merits of the Cause of the impeach'd Lords ,
farther than it has Relation to my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,62.359

And with respect to him , shall only give the Substance of the Articles
against him , and his Lordship's Answer . Upon which I shall make some
necessary Observations , which will let the Reader still further into
the Secret of this Unjust and Partial Prosecution .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,62.360

{COM:articles_of_impeachment_omitted}

<P_76>

Before I proceed further , in relation to the Prosecution of this
Impeachment , I shall make some Observations on the Matters mentin'd in
the beforemention'd Articles , which are plainly the effect of Prejudice
, and the most odious Malice . OLDMIXON-1716-2,76.363

His Lordship has himself fully answer'd them ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,76.364

but there are some Circumstances attending them , which were not proper
to be inserted in his Answer ; and which will demonstrate , that the
Intent of the Prosecutors , was rather to blacken the Lord <font> Somers
<$$font> , than to procure Justice against an Offender .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,76.365

I have already taken Notice of the Conduct of the Party , with respect
to the Partition Treaty , and that their Care of the Balance of <P_77>
Power was always Grimace , OLDMIXON-1716-2,77.366

for as soon as they could bring it about , they immediately gave it up
to the <font> French <$$font> King . OLDMIXON-1716-2,77.367

The 1st Article , and soon to the 6th , relate to the <font> Partition
Treaty <$$font> , the <font> Seventh <$$font> to his passing of Grants
in <font> England <$$font> and <font> Ireland <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,77.368

The <font> Resumption Bills <$$font> which were brought into the House
of Commons before and after this <font> Impeachment <$$font> , shew'd
what a Spirit the <font> Impeachers <$$font> were acted by ; and that
they had nothing less at Heart , than the Interest of the Publick .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,77.369

The Grants to the Duke of <font> Leeds <$$font> , the Earl of <font>
Rochester <$$font> , and other Courtiers , who had procur'd them during
the Arbitrary Government of King <font> Charles <$$font> II. and King
<font> James <$$font> II. were always excepted out of such Resumptions
, and only the Grants since the <font> Revolution <$$font> , affected by
them ; as if they were resum'd , purely because King <font> William
<$$font> gave them . OLDMIXON-1716-2,77.370

The 8th , 9th , 10th , 11th , and 12th Articles , which relate to the
Grant of <font> Rygate <$$font> , and the Fee-Farm {TEXT:Fee-Fam} Rents
, were suppos'd to be the Chief Occasion of the <font> Resumption Bills
<$$font> above-mention'd . OLDMIXON-1716-2,77.371

The <font> Manor <$$font> of <font> Rygate <$$font> was cry'd up to be
of great Value ; whereas , indeed , it is not 500 <font> l. <$$font> a
Year . OLDMIXON-1716-2,77.372

What the Party dislik'd most in it , was the Influence it gave the
Proprietor in Elections for Members of Parliament ; in which , however ,
my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> did never carry above one Member , except
in one Election , when Mr. <font> Thurland <$$font> and Mr. <font>
Harvey <$$font> turn'd out Sir <font> John Parsons <$$font> and his Son
; OLDMIXON-1716-2,77.373

but <font> Thurland <$$font> forgetting by whose Favour he was chosen ,
fell in with the Opposite Party ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,77.374

and ever since that my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> compounded the Matter
with Sir <font> John Parsons <$$font> , who has constantly been Chosen
with a Friend of his Lordship's . OLDMIXON-1716-2,77.375

It is said , that this <P_78> Agreement was made when Sir <font> John
Parsons <$$font> gave his Vote for Sir <font> Thomas Abney <$$font> to
be Lord Mayor , in Opposition to Sir <font> Charles Duncomb <$$font> ;
and that it was my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> who engag'd Sir <font>
John <$$font> to Vote for Sir <font> Thomas <$$font> , which Vote
carry'd the Election . OLDMIXON-1716-2,78.376

As to the Thirteenth Article concerning Captain <font> Kidd <$$font> ,
there were great Endeavours us'd to injure his Lordship's Reputation in
that Affair ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,78.377

and the Faction had the Impudence to report , that the Grant was given
him to enrich the Grantees with <font> Kidd <$$font> 's <font> Piracies
<$$font> . A most False and Villainous {TEXT:Villanous} Insinuation .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,78.378

The Fact is this . OLDMIXON-1716-2,78.379

There had been a General Complaint of the Insolence of the Pyrates in
our <font> American <$$font> Colonies , OLDMIXON-1716-2,78.380

and it was to suppress them , that the King made the Earl of <font>
Bellamont <$$font> Governor of <font> New-England <$$font> and <font>
New-York <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,78.381

As soon as it was known that the Earl of <font> Bellamont <$$font> had
those Governments given him , all Persons who had concerns in those
Colonies apply'd to him , and among others , Col. <font> Robert
Levingstone <$$font> , a Man of Fortune and Character , who had several
Employments in the Province of <font> New York <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,78.382

His Lordship discoursing with the Colonel about the great Scandal laid
on the Province , on Account of the Encouragement given there to Pyrates
; Colonel <font> Levingstone <$$font> confess'd , there was too much
ground for Complaint , OLDMIXON-1716-2,78.383

and from that Time he thought of a Project to prevent it for the future
; OLDMIXON-1716-2,78.384

coming to his Lordship Two or Three Days after , he told the Earl , he
had spoken to one Captain <font> Kidd <$$font> , lately come from <font>
New-York <$$font> , in a Sloop of his own , upon the Account of Trade ,
who told him , he knew most of the Chief Pyrates , and the Places of
their Rendezvous , offering to <P_79> undertake to seize most of them ,
if he might have the Command of one of the King's Ships of Thirty Guns
and 150 Men . OLDMIXON-1716-2,79.385

<font> Levingston <$$font> added , that <font> Kidd <$$font> was a bold
Honest Man , and he believ'd fitter than any other for the Employment .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,79.386

The Earl of <font> Bellamont <$$font> acquainted King <font> William
<$$font> with this Project , OLDMIXON-1716-2,79.387

and his Majesty inclin'd to hearken to it with the more readiness , for
that Informations were at the same time given upon Oath to the Secretary
of State , of several <font> Pyrates <$$font> that had sail'd from
<font> New-York <$$font> , <font> Bermudas <$$font> , and particularly
<font> Thomas Too <$$font> , <font> William Maze <$$font> , <font> John
Ireland <$$font> , and <font> Thomas Wake <$$font> , who had acquir'd
great Wealth by their Piracies . OLDMIXON-1716-2,79.388

The King referr'd the Matter to the Lords of the Admiralty ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,79.389

but the Occasions of the War were so pressing , that the Board declar'd
, they could not then spare a Ship or Men for that Service .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,79.390

<font> Levingston <$$font> , whose Heart was set on the Project ,
propos'd to the Earl of <font> Bellamont <$$font> , that since the
Government could not undertake it , private Adventurers might ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,79.391

and he had so good an Opinion of <font> Kidd <$$font> , and the Design ,
that he would gladly be one of them . OLDMIXON-1716-2,79.392

That these Adventurers should fit out a Ship at their own Charge , and
be repaid out of the Effects taken from the Pyrates , after such Effects
had been regularly condemn'd . OLDMIXON-1716-2,79.393

He offer'd to take a Fifth Part of the Adventure on himself ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,79.394

and <font> Levingston <$$font> assur'd the Earl , that <font> Kidd
<$$font> was a settled Inhabitant at <font> New-York <$$font> , that he
liv'd soberly there , had a Competent Estate , and marry'd a Wife with a
considerable Fortune , by whom he had a Child . To confirm which , he
further offer'd to be bound for <font> Kidd <$$font> 's faithful
Execution of his Commission . OLDMIXON-1716-2,79.395

The Earl made this Second Project <P_80> known to his Majesty , who was
pleas'd highly to approve of the Design ; to encourage which , he
declar'd , that the Persons whom the Earl should engage to be at the
Expence of the Voyage , should have a Grant of what <font> Kidd <$$font>
took from the Pyrates , as far as it might belong to him , except a Part
, which he would reserve to himself , chiefly to shew that he was a
Partner in the Undertaking . OLDMIXON-1716-2,80.396

Thus it was very plain , that the Earl of <font> Bellamont <$$font> ,
who was the first Mover in this Affair , proceeded in it with a truly
publick Spirit ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,80.397

and as a proof of it he us'd to complain of the great want of it in
others . OLDMIXON-1716-2,80.398

For notwithstanding the fair Prospect it had of being beneficial to the
Trade of the Nation , by securing it against Pyrates ; yet the Hazard
that was like to attend it , discourag'd most of those to whom he
communicated it , from undertaking it . OLDMIXON-1716-2,80.399

When the Earl found the Merchants and others who were most immediately
concern'd in the Security of Navigation , excus'd themselves , on
Account of the uncertainty of the <font> Adventure <$$font> ; he made
his Application to some Noble Lords , his Friends ; hoping , that more
generous Minds would consider the good of the Publick , more than a
private Gain . OLDMIXON-1716-2,80.400

Accordingly the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> , then Lord Chancellor , the
Duke of <font> Shrewsbury <$$font> , the Earl of <font> Romney <$$font>
, and the Earl of <font> Orford <$$font> , embrac'd the Proposition ,
into which came afterwards Sir <font> Edmund Harrison <$$font> , and
others , who being considerable Traders , the Lords left the Management
of the Adventure entirely to them . OLDMIXON-1716-2,80.401

The Earl of <font> Bellamont <$$font> declar'd often , that the Lords ,
his Friends , were so little acquainted with it , that they never saw
the Articles between <P_81> him and <font> Kidd <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.402

The latter gave the Security that was propos'd for his fair Behaviour ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.403

and such farther Caution was taken , that Sir <font> Edward Harrison
<$$font> would admit of no Officer , and hardly any Seamen in that
Service , who had not settled Families in <font> England <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.404

The Grantees gave Security to the Treasury , to account with the King
for the Produce of the Voyage . OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.405

What Success it had , and how <font> Kidd <$$font> turn'd Pyrate himself
, is too well known to need Repetition here . OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.406

The <font> Faction <$$font> immediately clamour'd against the <font>
Illegality <$$font> of the Commission and Grant , OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.407

and would fain have had it believ'd , that the Grantees were
Confederates with the <font> Pyrate Kidd <$$font> :
OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.408

But that was a <font> Calumny <$$font> too Black and too Absurd to gain
Ground to the Prejudice of the most Illustrious Characters in the
Kingdom , and of my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> 's in particular .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.409

And when that Wicked Report had not the Effect intended , the Illegality
of the Commission was insisted on , insomuch that the Matter was brought
into the House of Commons , OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.410

and being referr'd to a Committee of the whole House , the Question was
put the 6th of <font> December <$$font> 1699 . <font> That the Grant
was dishonourable to the King , against the Law of Nations , contrary to
the Laws and Statutes of this Realm , Invasive of Property , and
Destructive of Trade and Commerce <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.411

But it past in the <font> Negative <$$font> by a very great <font>
Majority <$$font> : OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.412

Nevertheless , the Party were not discourag'd , OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.413

but on the contrary , reviv'd the Clamour Two Months After : Upon which
a Grave Author writes thus , OLDMIXON-1716-2,81.414

" Several Attempts against a Noble Person then in a great Employment
having fail'd , and his Persecutors thinking it absolutely necessary for
their Purpose , that some <P_82> Charge or other should be kept
depending , the House was inform'd , on the 16th of <font> March
<$$font> that Captain <font> Kidd <$$font> was sent for Home ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,82.415

and immediately an Address was agreed to , That he might not be try'd ,
discharg'd or pardon'd till next Session of Parliament .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,82.416

It was whisper'd what great Things would appear , when the Earl of
<font> Bellamont <$$font> 's Papers were produc'd .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,82.417

It was insinuated there was another Commission not yet discover'd , and
that Secret Instructions of a Dangerous Nature would be found out . "
OLDMIXON-1716-2,82.418

<font> Kidd <$$font> being taken by the Earl of <font> Bellamont
<$$font> at <font> New-York <$$font> , and sent by him to <font> England
<$$font> , he was first examin'd by the Admiralty ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,82.419

and was ask'd , in plain Words , <font> If he could say any Thing in
Relation to the Earl of <$$font> Bellamont , <font> Earl of <$$font>
Romney , <font> Duke of <$$font> Shrewsbury , <font> Lord-Chancellor
<$$font> , <font> or Lord <$$font> Orford , <font> or any other of the
Owners , touching any private Directions , Articles , or Instructions .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,82.420

Kidd <$$font> in Answer , declar'd , " He had never seen the Duke of
<font> Shrewsbury <$$font> , or the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> , or had
heard more of them , than that the Earl of <font> Bellamont <$$font>
said they were Two of his Owners . That the same Earl had introduc'd
him to the Earl of <font> Orford <$$font> , and that Colonel <font>
Hewetson <$$font> had carry'd him to the Earl of <font> Romney <$$font>
, which was all he knew of them . That the Earl of <font> Bellamont
<$$font> and Sir <font> Edmund Harrison <$$font> were the Persons who
manag'd the Business . That he had no manner of Instructions from the
Owners , or any of them , Publick or Private , except sailing Orders
from the Earl of <font> Bellamont <$$font> whereby he was directed to
pursue his Commission . " OLDMIXON-1716-2,82.421

This Answer of his clears the Lords of any Sinister Design ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,82.422

and had the <font> Faction <$$font> <P_83> been sensible of Shame , must
have made them Blush to see it turn to their Glory , in undertaking a
Thing of so publick Benefit at their private Expence .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,83.423

<font> Kidd <$$font> prov'd a Rogue , OLDMIXON-1716-2,83.424

and the Grantees suffer'd the most by it , losing their Ship and all the
Charge they had been at about her . OLDMIXON-1716-2,83.425

<font> Kidd <$$font> being sent to <font> Newgate <$$font> , Orders were
given to keep him Close Prisoner . OLDMIXON-1716-2,83.426

<font> Whether that Order <$$font> , says the Author I have use of
before , <font> was observed to one sort of Men only , I can@ @not
affirm of my own Knowledge , OLDMIXON-1716-2,83.427

and therefore I will not rely so far on Reports , as to Name who were
said to be admitted to discourse him <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,83.428

'T@ @was a general Report , that some <font> Leading men <$$font> of the
Tory Party had been tampering with him in <font> Newgate <$$font> ,
where he lay almost a Year before they thought fit to have the Matter
canvass'd in Parliament . OLDMIXON-1716-2,83.429

In <font> March <$$font> 1700 . Sir <font> Edward Seymour <$$font> made
a Speech , wherein he took Notice , <font> That the House of Commons had
left them a Legacy to examine into the Conduct of a Conspiracy of
Pyrates <$$font> . Upon which all the Papers relating to <font> Kidd
<$$font> , were order'd to be laid before the House ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,83.430

and on <font> Friday <$$font> the 28th of <font> March <$$font> 1701 .
after a very long Debate upon the Question , <font> That a Grant pass'd
under the Great Seal of <$$font> England , <font> to <$$font> Richard
<font> Earl of <$$font> Bellamont , <font> and others , of all the Goods
, Merchandizes , Treasure , and other Things therein Granted , which
should be taken by <$$font> Kidd , <font> from <$$font> Thomas Too ,
John Ireland , <font> and others in the said Grant mention'd as Pyrates
before their Conviction , is Illegal and Void <$$font> ;
OLDMIXON-1716-2,83.431

It pass'd in the <font> Negative <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,83.432

Thus are there Two <font> Votes <$$font> of the House of Commons
justifying this Grant ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,83.433

and yet this Article of the Impeachment of the Lord <font> Somers
<$$font> makes it <P_84> a High Crime and Misdemeanor in his Lordship ,
to be so far concern'd in it as he was . OLDMIXON-1716-2,84.434

The next Day , Application was made , that <font> Kidd <$$font> might be
prosecuted according to Law . OLDMIXON-1716-2,84.435

In the following Paragraphs I shall again make use of my last Author ,
who wrote in the Defence of the Earl of <font> Bellamont <$$font> , and
seems to be at the bottom of this Business . OLDMIXON-1716-2,84.436

{COM:quotation_omitted}

<P_85>

The horrid Conspiracy against the Reputation of my Lord <font> Somers
<$$font> , will appear visibly , in what my Author says further on this
Subject . OLDMIXON-1716-2,85.439

{COM:quotation_omitted}

<P_86>

This Sir <font> Edward Seymour <$$font> was , as every one knows , the
Bully and Spokesman of the <font> Faction <$$font> ; a Champion of
<font> High-Church <$$font> , tho' he made his Brags that he had not
been in any Church in Seven Years Time . OLDMIXON-1716-2,86.442

With him join'd in this Dirty Business , the <font> Harcourts <$$font> ,
the <font> Harleys <$$font> , the <font> Winningtons <$$font> , the St.
<font> Johns <$$font> , and the rest of them , well known in more Modern
Story , for their Zeal for the same Church , and their Friendship to
<font> France <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,86.443

Sir <font> Edward Seymour <$$font> declar'd , he would never believe a
Word <font> Kidd <$$font> said more : OLDMIXON-1716-2,86.444

But he is not to be believ'd himself . OLDMIXON-1716-2,86.445

His Inveteracy against the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> was such , that
he caught at every Thing which he thought he cou'd turn to his
Lordship's Disadvantage , and greedily receiv'd it , let it come from
what Hand it would . OLDMIXON-1716-2,86.446

He did not put with <font> Kidd <$$font> so , OLDMIXON-1716-2,86.447

<P_87>

but continu'd to practise with him in hopes of making something of the
Evidence of this <font> Rogue and Fool <$$font> , as he call'd him in
the House of Commons . OLDMIXON-1716-2,87.449

{COM:quotation_omitted}

<P_89>

I think there never was a plainer Detection of an intended Subornation
of Evidence , than Sir <font> Edward Seymour <$$font> 's Practices on
<font> Kidd <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,89.452

What a graceless <font> Faction <$$font> must that be , who after all
this cou'd have the Face to make so Innocent and so Useful a Design an
Article of Impeachment ? OLDMIXON-1716-2,89.453

They themselves did not doubt the Legality of such a Grant some Years
before , when a Creature of theirs , Sir <font> Robert Holmes <$$font> ,
procur'd one from King <font> James <$$font> , wherein not only all
Pyrates Goods , but even <font> Bona Depredata <$$font> were granted in
express Terms , without any qualifying Clause whatsoever .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,89.454

But as I have observ'd already , King <font> James <$$font> was so dear
to them , that they could bear any Thing from him ; whereas from King
<font> William <$$font> , to whom they ow'd the <P_90> Enjoyment of
their Religion , Estates , Laws and Liberties , they could not suffer
the least Exercise of the Prerogative Royal , without Clamour .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,90.455

I shall conclude my Reflections on this Article about <font> Kidd
<$$font> , with a Passage which is the best Justification of the Lords
concern'd in his Ship , it being the Testimony of that King himself .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,90.456

When the Parliament , that debated this Matter was risen , his Majesty
was pleas'd to honour a Noble Lord with his Company at Dinner .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,90.457

While they were at Table , a Discourse arose concerning <font> Kidd
<$$font> , and the Trouble occasion'd by that Business to the Persons
concern'd in the Grant : Upon which his Majesty was pleas'd graciously
to say , <font> That if by the Law of <$$font> England <font> he could
be a Witness , he could of his own Knowledge justify the Lords concern'd
in all they had done in that Affair <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,90.458

I might have said much more to the Articles relating to the <font> Irish
<$$font> Grants as well as the <font> English <$$font> , and those to
the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> himself , to shew , that the Faction had
nothing in the World in View by this Prosecution , but to justify the
False Reports they had maliciously spread of his Lordship , by as false
and groundless a Process in the Supream Court of Judicature in <font>
England <$$font> ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,90.459

but enough has been said on this Head , OLDMIXON-1716-2,90.460

and I shall therefore proceed to shew how they manag'd a Process so ill
found as this was . OLDMIXON-1716-2,90.461

On the 24th of <font> May <$$font> , 1701 . Sir <font> John Hoskins
<$$font> and Sir <font> Robert Legard <$$font> , Two Masters in <font>
Chancery <$$font> , were order'd by the House of Lords to carry the Lord
<font> Somers <$$font> 's Answer to the House of Commons , which was
read the 27th , and committed to the Committee appointed to draw up the
Articles . OLDMIXON-1716-2,90.462

<P_91>

The Lords observing , that the Commons deferr'd the Tryal of the
Impeach'd Lords , sent a Message to them on the 20th of <font> May
<$$font> , to put them in Mind of the Earl of <font> Orford <$$font> 's
, and to acquaint them , the Earl had desir'd a Day might be set for his
Tryal . OLDMIXON-1716-2,91.464

But it seems the <font> Impeachers <$$font> were not in so much Haste to
try the Lord <font> Orford <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,91.465

Their main Attack was to be against the Lord <font> Somers <$$font> ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,91.466

and they resolv'd to begin with him . OLDMIXON-1716-2,91.467

Accordingly , in Answer to the Message about the Lord <font> Orford
<$$font> , the Commons reply'd , the 31st of <font> May <$$font> ,
OLDMIXON-1716-2,91.468

{COM:quotation_omitted}

This was reported by Mr. <font> Bromley <$$font> , who was Secretary of
State at the same time with the late Viscount <font> Bolingbroke
<$$font> ; OLDMIXON-1716-2,91.470

and I must own it is with great Delight , that I find these Men acting
together against my Lord <font> Somers <$$font> Fourteen Years ago , who
Ten Years after that , were acting together against the Revolution and
Protestant Succession . OLDMIXON-1716-2,91.471

This last Reply occasion'd a Conference between the Two Houses , the 6th
of <font> June <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,91.472

Mr. St. <font> John <$$font> was sent by the Commons to the Lords to
desire it . OLDMIXON-1716-2,91.473

Mr. <font> Harcourt <$$font> manag'd it at the Conference , for the
Commons ; and the Duke of <font> Devonshire <$$font> for the Lords .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,91.474

The Commons desir'd , <font> That a Committee <P_92> of both Houses be
nominated to consider of the most proper Ways and Methods of proceeding
on Impeachments , according to the Usage of Parliament <$$font> .
OLDMIXON-1716-2,92.475

But the Lords having appointed a set Day , the 19th of <font> June
<$$font> , for the Tryal of the Earl of <font> Orford <$$font> ; and
having given the Commons Notice of it Ten Days before , their Lordships
taking this Proposal of a Committee of both Houses , to be made with an
Intention to delay the Trial of the <font> Impeachments <$$font> , did
not think proper to agree to it . OLDMIXON-1716-2,92.476

On the 10th of <font> June <$$font> , Mr. <font> Harcourt <$$font>
brought them a Message from the Commons , insisting on that Committee of
both Houses , OLDMIXON-1716-2,92.477

and the Question being debated in the House of Lords , <font> Whether a
Committee of this House shall be appointed to meet a Committee of the
House of Commons , in Relation to the Proceedings upon the Impeachment
<$$font> , it pass'd in the Negative . OLDMIXON-1716-2,92.478

On the 11th of <font> June <$$font> , a Message was sent to the Lords by
Mr. <font> Gery <$$font> and Sir <font> Richard Holford , That the
Lords had appointed <$$font> Friday <font> next the 13th
{COM:font_change_excludes_numerals} of <$$font> June , <font> for the
Tryal of <$$font> John <font> Lord <$$font> Somers , <font> upon the
Impeachment against him <$$font> . OLDMIXON-1716-2,92.479
