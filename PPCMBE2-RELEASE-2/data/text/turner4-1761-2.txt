was not much the worse for drinking , for I drank but a very small
quantity and wrote 8 letters after I came home , TURNER4-1761-2,218.139

but still my conscience tells me I had in some measure impaired the use
of my reason <paren> which I believe is not right so to do <$$paren> .

sure I am of all men the most miserable TURNER4-1761-2,218.166

...

Drunkenness is only as an inlet to all other vices ,
TURNER4-1761-2,218.168

for when reason is laid asleep , then , then , sense and passion ride
triumphant , so weak is nature <paren> or at least corrupt and fallen
nature <$$paren> . TURNER4-1761-2,218.169

But what I most stand aghast at is to think how miserable <paren> nay ,

should I sleep never to open my eyes again in this world <paren>
whenever I am in liquor <$$paren> . TURNER4-1761-2,219.170

No , my portion must be that of the wicked person who knows not God , ah

gnashing of teeth . TURNER4-1761-2,219.171

TURNER4-1761-2,220.231

Oh , what a scene , or rather lesson of mortality is here !
TURNER4-1761-2,220.232

How should instances of this kind awaken the remaining part of mankind
to prepare for that awful moment which we all know must come sooner or
later ! TURNER4-1761-2,220.233

And from this and many other instances we may be convinced that it often
happens as it were instantaneous , without any warning of the approach ,

TURNER4-1761-2,220.234

that we may not be afraid to meet death whenever it may happen <paren>
though it should be sudden <$$paren> ! TURNER4-1761-2,220.235

ascendant of the spiritual as not to make it our most comfortable hopes
that we may one day through God's grace enjoy a life which will have no
end , where we shall not be disturbed with cares and anxieties , but
enjoy the blessings prepared for them who love God ?

In the morn down at Halland where there was I believe nearly 5_hundred
people to attend his Grace to Lewes , the election <P_221> being there
for the county today , but no opposition TURNER4-1761-2,221.270

...

After tea our late servant went home TURNER4-1761-2,221.272

...

My wife , poor creature , extreme ill . TURNER4-1761-2,221.274

This day we had sent us for a present from Halland a shoulder of lamb .
TURNER4-1761-2,221.275

Oh , how glad am I the hurry and confusion is over at Halland ,
TURNER4-1761-2,221.276

for it quite puts me out of that regular way of life which I am so fond
of , TURNER4-1761-2,221.277

and not only so , TURNER4-1761-2,221.278

but occasions one by a too great hurry of spirits many times to commit
such actions as is not agreeable to reason and religion ,
TURNER4-1761-2,221.279

for when reason is in a flustering state the passions are apt to ride
triumphant . TURNER4-1761-2,221.280

My wife , poor creature , most extreme ill TURNER4-1761-2,221.283

...

She has now been ill these 28 weeks past TURNER4-1761-2,221.285

yet bears it all with the greatest patience and resignation to the
divine will , making it her constant and earnest prayer to God for grace
to strengthen her weakness , that she may not be impatient .

...

In the afternoon down at Mr. Porter's a-copying out an agreement which
he had drawed up between himself and Mr. Joseph Burges , wherein Mr.
Burges hath sold to Mr. Porter all his freehold land and a copyhold
messuage and some land late Durrant's for 900 +L {TEXT:+L900} , the
conveyance to be signed and the money to be paid at New Michaelmas day
next . TURNER4-1761-2,221.289

Mr. Burges is to clear the said premises of all quit-rents , taxes ,
annuities etc. to the said time TURNER4-1761-2,221.290

and he is not to cut any timber , trees , tillows , shaws , hedges or
underwoods , TURNER4-1761-2,221.291

and is to be allowed 10 +L {TEXT:+L10} 10@ @s. 0@ @d. for all the dung
, muck , compost , mould etc. which is now made or that he shall
hereafter make on the said premises , TURNER4-1761-2,221.292

and all expenses attending the same is to be paid between them ,
TURNER4-1761-2,221.293

and , as there is an annuity of 12 +L {TEXT:+L12} per_annum payable
yearly out of the freehold to Sarah the wife of Joseph Burges deceased ,
Mr. Porter agrees to pay that upon Mr. Burges's leaving 50 +L
{TEXT:+L50} with him , which he thereby engages to do ,
TURNER4-1761-2,221.294

and if ever Mr. Burges offers his other copyhold to sale <paren> late
Jenner's <$$paren> Mr. Porter is to have the refusal of it at 200 +L
{TEXT:+L200} <paren> though Mr. Porter declared several times
afterwards in mine and Joseph Fuller's presence that whenever Mr.
Burges should pay off the mortgage which he is to have upon it , Mr.
Burges should be at liberty to sell it to anyone he thought proper
<$$font> , TURNER4-1761-2,221.295

and if any of the parties does not comply with every of the aforesaid
articles he is bound to pay the other the sum of hundred pounds forfeit
. TURNER4-1761-2,221.296

After both parties had signed <P_222> it , Joseph Fuller and myself ,
who was both in presence all the time , set our names as witnesses to
the same . TURNER4-1761-2,222.297

We stayed at Mr. Porter's till about 9.50 . TURNER4-1761-2,222.298

I am sincerely sorry I was so unfortunate as to be thought a proper
person to be a witness to their agreement , TURNER4-1761-2,222.299

for in my opinion Mr. Burges is not equally qualified with Mr. Porter
to make a bargain TURNER4-1761-2,222.300

and I think the truth is verified in this present bargain ,
TURNER4-1761-2,222.301

and if I was present and witness to a thing my conscience told me not
right <paren> as mine undoubtedly did <$$paren> then undoubtedly I am
culpable and to blame in acting contrary to my own conscience and of
consequence to the Christian religion , of which I am an unworthy member
. TURNER4-1761-2,222.302

Whoever may happen to see this when I am no more I beg he would not
think I mention this to show myself more righteous or honest than the
rest of mankind . TURNER4-1761-2,222.303

No ! I have no such thoughts , TURNER4-1761-2,222.304

but am truly sensible I am a poor , wicked , and polluted creature , and
perhaps my best actions may be just matter for repentance .
TURNER4-1761-2,222.305

Neither do I mention it to condemn Mr. Porter as an over-reaching and
unjust person . TURNER4-1761-2,222.306

No , I mention it purely to show how frail , how weak , our nature is ,
that when self_interest is the concern we are always as it were partial
in our own favour , even so fond are we of our dear selves as to do
things which we would blush at and even condemn as blameworthy in
another , TURNER4-1761-2,222.307

and yet so blind are we like holy David as not to know we are the very
persons we pass sentence on . TURNER4-1761-2,222.308

Therefore how constant and earnest should we be in our prayers to
Almighty God , that he would try us and search out the ground of our
hearts and direct our ways , TURNER4-1761-2,222.309

for who of us knows how oft he offends ? TURNER4-1761-2,222.310

...

My wife , poor creature , most extremely ill . TURNER4-1761-2,222.312

A dull heavy time for trade ; TURNER4-1761-2,222.313

never did I know it so dull before . TURNER4-1761-2,222.314

I am quite as it were overwhelmed with trouble . TURNER4-1761-2,222.315

<font> Fri. 17 Apr. <$$font> TURNER4-1761-2,222.316

...

At home all day . TURNER4-1761-2,222.318

My wife somewhat easier than yesterday , but really extremely ill .
TURNER4-1761-2,222.319

Very little to do all day . TURNER4-1761-2,222.320

Oh , how does my poor wife's illness and her continual pain afflict me .
TURNER4-1761-2,222.321

Could it be described I think it would melt a heart as obdurate as flint
into compassion and sympathetic sorrow . TURNER4-1761-2,222.322

Gave 6@ @d. to a brief for fire which was collected from house to house
. TURNER4-1761-2,222.323
