Act {TEXT:Act.} II . STEVENS-1745-1,18.4

Scene I . STEVENS-1745-1,18.5

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Humphry Fat-sides , <font> solus . <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,18.6

<$$heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> Humphry . Zoons ! STEVENS-1745-1,18.8

that Wine last Night has swell'd me like a <font> Porpus . <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,18.9

Bad Wine is Ratsbane to me ; STEVENS-1745-1,18.10

but it@ @'s as much owing to my Constitution , as any Thing .
STEVENS-1745-1,18.11

- Well ! I shall never hold it long , STEVENS-1745-1,18.12

that@ @'s certain . STEVENS-1745-1,18.13

It@ @s an ill Sign , when the Appetite fails . STEVENS-1745-1,18.14

Time has been , I could have eat every Hour in the Day .
STEVENS-1745-1,18.15

- But now , Heaven help me ! STEVENS-1745-1,18.16

five or six Meals will serve the whole Four_and_Twenty Hours .
STEVENS-1745-1,18.17

- When one ca@ @n't eat , 't@ @is Time to say one's Prayers .
STEVENS-1745-1,18.18

<font> Enter <$$font> Ned Easy . STEVENS-1745-1,18.19

<font> Easy . <$$font> What ! Sir <font> Humphry ; <$$font> How fares
it with my old Friend ? STEVENS-1745-1,18.20

Time has separated our Persons indeed , but I hope , not our Friendship
. STEVENS-1745-1,18.21

I am glad to see you look so well . STEVENS-1745-1,18.22

You hold your own , I see . - No ways declining in your Person .
STEVENS-1745-1,18.23

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> In that Point , you are mistaken , <font>
Ned . <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,18.24

But I@ @'m glad to see you with all my Heart . STEVENS-1745-1,18.25

- For I am declining every Way , as in Eating , Drinking , Whoring ,
being merry ; STEVENS-1745-1,18.26

- why - I am as dull , Man ! as a Cat , that has lately lost her
Kittens ; tho' it is chiefly owing to the Want of <P_19> good Company .
STEVENS-1745-1,19.27

There@ @'s not one good Fellow left in Town , that is worth conversing
with . STEVENS-1745-1,19.28

- Well ! Go when I will , you@ @'ll never meet my Fellow .
STEVENS-1745-1,19.29

<font> Easy {COM:missing_period} <$$font> That I@ @'ll be sworn , Sir
<font> Humphry . <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,19.30

But what@ @'s become of our old Friend , Sir <font> Charles Freeman ?
<$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,19.31

You and he us'd to be Inseparables . STEVENS-1745-1,19.32

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> 'T@ @is true , <font> Ned <$$font> ,
STEVENS-1745-1,19.33

I see him often ; STEVENS-1745-1,19.34

but he@ @'s grown such a mad-headed Fellow of late , - so much
degenerated from his antient Friendship , that he@ @'s continually
making me his Butt to shoot his Jests at ; that was I to keep him
constant Company , I should soon dwindle into an Anatomy , die of a
Consumption , and have my Elegy roar'd about the Streets for him to read
, and laugh at , boasting that he roasted me out of this little Breath I
have . STEVENS-1745-1,19.35

No , no , <font> Ned <$$font> , I have done with him .
STEVENS-1745-1,19.36

- Yet I ca@ @n't help thinking , the young Dog puts Love-powder in my
Wine . STEVENS-1745-1,19.37

- Meet him when I will , we must drink together , STEVENS-1745-1,19.38

and then I cling to him , as close as Nature to her own Works .
STEVENS-1745-1,19.39

<font> Easy <$$font> He always was a free-hearted Lad ,
STEVENS-1745-1,19.40

lov'd a Jest , STEVENS-1745-1,19.41

and always spoke it home ; STEVENS-1745-1,19.42

I am sorry however , he should bear upon his old Acquaintance so hard .
STEVENS-1745-1,19.43

- But , if I mistake not , here he comes . STEVENS-1745-1,19.44

- I@ @'ll speak to him in your Behalf . STEVENS-1745-1,19.45

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Dear <font> Ned <$$font> , let me go ;
STEVENS-1745-1,19.46

for the young Dog certainly carries a Familiar about him .
STEVENS-1745-1,19.47

If I see but his Face , 't@ @is enough ; STEVENS-1745-1,19.48

I sha@ @n't part from him these twelve Hours . STEVENS-1745-1,19.49

<font> Easy <$$font> 'T@ @is now too late to avoid him , Sir <font>
Humphry <$$font> ; STEVENS-1745-1,19.50

for he@ @'s just upon us . STEVENS-1745-1,19.51

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Then , dear <font> Ned <$$font> , let me
stand behind you ; STEVENS-1745-1,19.52

and do you shift him off , my good Friend , as soon as possible .
STEVENS-1745-1,19.53

<P_20>

<font> Easy <$$font> Well , Sir <font> Humphry <$$font> , I@ @'ll do you
that Courtesy ; STEVENS-1745-1,20.55

but , I fear , it will too nearly resemble that Scene in the Second Part
of <font> Henry the Fourth <$$font> , of the Page's Attempt to screen
Sir <font> John Falstaff <$$font> from the Eye of Justice .
STEVENS-1745-1,20.56

<bracket> <font> Sir <$$font> Humphry <font> goes behind <$$font> Easy .
STEVENS-1745-1,20.57

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Charles Freeman . STEVENS-1745-1,20.58

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Dear <font> Ned Easy <$$font> , Thou@ @'rt
welcome to Town , my Boy . STEVENS-1745-1,20.59

Give me thy Hand . STEVENS-1745-1,20.60

- What Smell@ @'s this ? STEVENS-1745-1,20.61

- Does@ @n't something offend thy Nose , <font> Ned ? <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,20.62

<bracket> <font> seeing Sir <$$font> Humphry . STEVENS-1745-1,20.63

<$$bracket> <font> Easy <$$font> Not mine , Sir <font> Charles <$$font>
, I@ @'ll assure you . STEVENS-1745-1,20.64

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> So ! he@ @'s beginning ;
STEVENS-1745-1,20.65

but all my Hopes are , that he sees me not . STEVENS-1745-1,20.66

I wish he were once gone . STEVENS-1745-1,20.67

<bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,20.68

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Then thou@ @'st lost the Sense of thy
Smelling . STEVENS-1745-1,20.69

Which Way are you walking ? STEVENS-1745-1,20.70

<font> Easy <$$font> To my Lodgings , Sir <font> Charles . <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,20.71

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> If they are not too far off , I@ @'ll walk
with you . STEVENS-1745-1,20.72

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> A pox confound him ! STEVENS-1745-1,20.73

'T@ @is as I thought . STEVENS-1745-1,20.74

Well ! there@ @'s no Way left to escape him . STEVENS-1745-1,20.75

I@ @'ll turn it into Banter . <bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,20.76

<font> <bracket> He comes from behind <$$font> Easy .
STEVENS-1745-1,20.77

What ! Sir <font> Charles . <$$font> - How fares it with you ?
STEVENS-1745-1,20.78

I find an old Acquaintance may stand Hours before you@ @'ll speak to him
. STEVENS-1745-1,20.79

By Heavens ! thou art not worth hanging of late . STEVENS-1745-1,20.80

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> What ! Sir <font> Humphry <$$font> there .
STEVENS-1745-1,20.81

<font> Ned <$$font> , how could'st bear him so long behind thee ?
STEVENS-1745-1,20.82

Are you not almost suffocated ? STEVENS-1745-1,20.83

<font> Easy <$$font> With what . Sir <font> Charles ? <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,20.84

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Why , with his Breath , Man .
STEVENS-1745-1,20.85

He feeds on nothing but Garlick and Onions ; STEVENS-1745-1,20.86

besides , <P_21> the Grain of his Hide is very rank .
STEVENS-1745-1,21.87

Why , he is grown so troublesome to all his Acquaintance , that they ca@
@n't bear him within a Furlong of their Noses . STEVENS-1745-1,21.88

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Peace , ye Whoreson Knave ,
STEVENS-1745-1,21.89

or , by this Light , I@ @'ll make a Die on@ @'t , and lay my Death to
your Charge . STEVENS-1745-1,21.90

<font> Easy <$$font> Come , Sir <font> Charles <$$font> , you must bear
with your old Friend . STEVENS-1745-1,21.91

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> But I must tell you , <font> Ned <$$font> -
The other Day , as I was talking with an old Friend of ours , <font> Ned
Rakewell <$$font> , all on a sudden he started , asking me , if I did
not smell Punch , <paren> meaning Sir <font> Humphry <$$paren> <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,21.92

why , answers I , I have a Scent of him . STEVENS-1745-1,21.93

- Well ! Adieu then , says he , STEVENS-1745-1,21.94

I ca@ @n't bear him any nearer . STEVENS-1745-1,21.95

So taking his Leave , in an abrupt Manner , left me -
STEVENS-1745-1,21.96

I , turning the Corner of the Street , meets Sir <font> Humphry <$$font>
, puffing and blowing , as if his Guts were about his Heels , infecting
the wholesome Air with his rank Breath . STEVENS-1745-1,21.97

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Why , <font> Ned <$$font> , only that I know
he@ @'s bantering me , STEVENS-1745-1,21.98

or else I@ @'d case him , like a Rabbit . STEVENS-1745-1,21.99

- You know , I always wear my Rapier sharp ; STEVENS-1745-1,21.100

it will answer the Purpose , when I put it to the Trial .
STEVENS-1745-1,21.101

He knows he durst@ @n't use me thus , if - STEVENS-1745-1,21.102

But he presumes on my Patience . STEVENS-1745-1,21.103

I am made up , he knows , of nothing but Patience .
STEVENS-1745-1,21.104

- He@ @'s willing to gall and fret me , STEVENS-1745-1,21.105

but I am not to be mov'd . STEVENS-1745-1,21.106

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Not all Patience ! a few Guts , good Sir
<font> Humphry . <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,21.107

I must say this for thee , STEVENS-1745-1,21.108

thou@ @'rt as sweet a Composition of good Nature and Smell , as any
<font> Pole-Cat <$$font> in <font> Europe <$$font> , as your old Friend
<font> Rakewell <$$font> observes . STEVENS-1745-1,21.109

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Well ! I ca@ @n't hold it any longer . -
You Knighted Grey-hound ; <font> you French <$$font> Curs .
STEVENS-1745-1,21.110

Both <P_22> <font> Rakewell <$$font> and you look like the very Scum and
Refuse of <font> France <$$font> , as if neither of you had fed on any
Thing but Soups , stew'd from a Carrot or Cabbage .
STEVENS-1745-1,22.111

Nature is asham'd to own such Sons of Poverty . STEVENS-1745-1,22.112

- Had I a Looking-Glass here , I@ @'d make you blush at your own
despicable Figures if you had any Grace in you . STEVENS-1745-1,22.113

Dear <font> Ned Easy <$$font> , do you bear me Witness , if what I say
be not just : STEVENS-1745-1,22.114

His Eyes are shrunk into his Head ; STEVENS-1745-1,22.115

his Forehead has as many Wrinkles , as that of a worn_out Bawd ;
STEVENS-1745-1,22.116

his Cheeks are drawn into his Throat , to assist his Lungs ;
STEVENS-1745-1,22.117

and his Chops look as thin and meagre , as Don <font> Quixotes <$$font>
, the <font> Knight of the woful Countenance . <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,22.118

His Chin represents a Boy's Gig ; STEVENS-1745-1,22.119

his Arms and Legs are dwindled away with Whoring ; STEVENS-1745-1,22.120

and his Body@ @'s decay'd with Intemperance . STEVENS-1745-1,22.121

Examine him throughout , and he makes a most shocking Figure .
STEVENS-1745-1,22.122

Why , Man ! STEVENS-1745-1,22.123

- but hold ! STEVENS-1745-1,22.124

I ca@ @n't call thee so neither . STEVENS-1745-1,22.125

'T@ @is a Wrong done to those that really are so .
STEVENS-1745-1,22.126

Thou only art the awkward Representation of a Man .
STEVENS-1745-1,22.127

Dear <font> Ned <$$font> , do but observe him . STEVENS-1745-1,22.128

He@ @'s really a mere <font> Memento Mori . <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,22.129

Look on me . STEVENS-1745-1,22.130

I am the Reverse . A Man that has Substance , not Appearance only , the
portly Bulk of a Man . STEVENS-1745-1,22.131

But I@ @'m to blame . STEVENS-1745-1,22.132

Patience is a Virtue , by which we should curb our Passions .
STEVENS-1745-1,22.133

'T@ @is done ; STEVENS-1745-1,22.134

I have overcome myself , STEVENS-1745-1,22.135

and all is over . STEVENS-1745-1,22.136

'T@ @is a fine Thing to be the Master of one's Passions .
STEVENS-1745-1,22.137

Come , <font> Charles <$$font> , your Hand , my Boy .
STEVENS-1745-1,22.138

<bracket> <font> takes hold of his Hand . <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,22.139

<$$bracket> I have done ; STEVENS-1745-1,22.140

I am quite cool . STEVENS-1745-1,22.141

I have run over your Infirmities but slightly . STEVENS-1745-1,22.142

I love to make the best of Things ; STEVENS-1745-1,22.143

I - STEVENS-1745-1,22.144

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Nay , if you have not done , take Breath a
little , STEVENS-1745-1,22.145

and begin again . STEVENS-1745-1,22.146

- I@ @'ll hear you , with your own Virtue , Patience
STEVENS-1745-1,22.147

but I am <P_23> much afraid you have over-heated your Grease ;
STEVENS-1745-1,23.148

and should it be so ; should any Part of it chance to drop on thy
inflam'd Liver , it might go near to set that Lump of combustible Stuff
on Fire . STEVENS-1745-1,23.149

<font> Easy . <$$font> Come , come , Friends , have done ;
STEVENS-1745-1,23.150

both have done ; STEVENS-1745-1,23.151

you@ @'ll not give me Leave to put a Word in . STEVENS-1745-1,23.152

- Pray let@ @'s turn this Conversation . STEVENS-1745-1,23.153

- How fares it with <font> Modern's <$$font> Family ?
STEVENS-1745-1,23.154

Are either of his beautiful Nieces married yet ? STEVENS-1745-1,23.155

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> If you@ @'ll undertake to mediate a Peace
between Sir <font> Charles <$$font> and myself , I@ @'ll undertake to
inform you of <font> Modern . <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,23.156

<font> Easy . <$$font> I@ @'ll answer for Sir <font> Charles .
<$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,23.157

- But what of <font> Modern ? <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,23.158

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Why , Yesterday , I had his Company from ten
in the Morning till ten at Night , and with him , his Cousin <font>
Friendly <$$font> , who is to go out of Town this Morning .
STEVENS-1745-1,23.159

- Sir <font> George <$$font> was quite in the Hyp , and the Reason very
easy to be guess'd . STEVENS-1745-1,23.160

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> The old Tone ; his Wife , I suppose .
STEVENS-1745-1,23.161

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> The same . STEVENS-1745-1,23.162

- He entertain'd us with a Pack of dismal Stories ;
STEVENS-1745-1,23.163

but to cast out that Devil <font> Melancholy <$$font> , I ply'd him
close with Wine , which you know Sir <font> Charles <$$font> , is a
never-failing Remedy . STEVENS-1745-1,23.164

It produced its usual Effects . STEVENS-1745-1,23.165

The old Knight began to be jolly , STEVENS-1745-1,23.166

and so continued , till he had lost the Use of his Tongue ;
STEVENS-1745-1,23.167

and then , being unfit for Company , I sent him home Tongue-tied , that
should his Wife be there , before him , she might take the Opportunity
by his Fault to extenuate her own . STEVENS-1745-1,23.168

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Well done , <font> Bacchus . <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,23.169

- Was that the best Way , you could devise , to sooth the poor Man's
Grief , to send him home uncapable to let his Wife know how far she
wrongs his Honour ? STEVENS-1745-1,23.170

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> The very best Way in the World . <P_24>
<font> Sir Charles . <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,24.171

Had he gone home sober , he would have touch'd her no doubt to the Quick
with his Reproaches , STEVENS-1745-1,24.172

and that would have been the worst Way in the World -
STEVENS-1745-1,24.173

For when a Woman finds herself lasht hard , she falls into all the
Extravagancies of her Sex : STEVENS-1745-1,24.174

So , in sending him home silent , I made Peace between them both , both
considering themselves Guilty ; whereas otherwise , perhaps there might
have been a Separation . STEVENS-1745-1,24.175

<font> Easy . <$$font> Thou art an excellent Casuist , and a brave
Votary to the Juice of the Grape - STEVENS-1745-1,24.176

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Oh , Sir , give him but a Text , he@ @'ll
hold forth four_and_twenty Hours successively , let Drinking be the
Subject STEVENS-1745-1,24.177

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Come , a Plague of you , Sir <font> Charles
<$$font> , STEVENS-1745-1,24.178

you have almost fretted me out of my Spirits . STEVENS-1745-1,24.179

I shall certainly drop , unless supported by a Rummer of Wine .
STEVENS-1745-1,24.180

What say you ? STEVENS-1745-1,24.181

Shall we empty a Flask together ? STEVENS-1745-1,24.182

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Sir <font> Humphry <$$font> , with all my
Heart . STEVENS-1745-1,24.183

Come , <font> Ned <$$font> , will you take Part of Sir <font> Humphry's
<$$font> Flask ? STEVENS-1745-1,24.184

<font> Easy <$$font> Will I ! STEVENS-1745-1,24.185

ay , that I will . STEVENS-1745-1,24.186

Come then , let@ @'s away . STEVENS-1745-1,24.187

I@ @'d pledge Sir <font> Humphry <$$font> in a Bumper , as soon as any
Man I know . STEVENS-1745-1,24.188

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Ay , ay , it shall be my Flask , with all my
Heart ; STEVENS-1745-1,24.189

and it joys me much , that I have two of my old Acquaintance to partake
of it . STEVENS-1745-1,24.190

- But it shall be your two Bottles a Man , before we part . <font>
<paren> Aside . <$$paren> <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,24.191

Scene II . STEVENS-1745-1,24.194

Amarinda's <font> Lodgings . <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,24.195

<$$heading>

<font> Enter <$$font> Amarinda , <font> and <$$font> Betty , <font> her
Maid . <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,24.197

<font> Amar. Betty <$$font> , by your long and faithful Services to my
Sister and me , I am thoroughly satisfied you <P_25> love us both ;
STEVENS-1745-1,25.198

and was the Question seriously to be put to you , I am sensible you
would not readily know where to give the Preference .
STEVENS-1745-1,25.199

We have both had sufficient Proofs of your Secrecy ; for which Reason I
shall venture to put my Fortune into your Power ; and have Confidence
enough to think you will not make an ill Use of this Condescention .
STEVENS-1745-1,25.200

<font> Betty . <$$font> It has always been the Study of my Life , Madam
, to serve , and please you both ; STEVENS-1745-1,25.201

and therefore , dear Madam , believe me , STEVENS-1745-1,25.202

and I swear by the God of Love , and as I hope to be married very soon ,
<paren> and I ca@ @n't swear by any Thing greater , nor by any Thing I
desire more <$$paren> that let it be what it will , I will be as secret
as the Grave , and as circumspect as <font> Argus .
STEVENS-1745-1,25.203

- Amar. <$$font> Know then , <font> Betty <$$font> , there has long
been an Amour subsisting between Sir <font> Charles Freeman <$$font> and
myself , STEVENS-1745-1,25.204

and I have too much Reason to suspect that poor <font> Juliana <$$font>
is caught in the same Snare . STEVENS-1745-1,25.205

- I have desir'd Sir <font> Charles <$$font> , whenever he comes , not
to make the least Difference between us , unless it were to give <font>
Juliana <$$font> the Preference . STEVENS-1745-1,25.206

How far I have been to blame in this Conduct to my Sister , I will not
take upon me to determine . STEVENS-1745-1,25.207

- This Secret therefore you must sift out of her , which will satisfy my
impatient Curiosity , and give Sir <font> Charles <$$font> Time to make
a speedy , and honourable Retreat . STEVENS-1745-1,25.208

- And then we must lay our Heads together to fix her somewhere else .
STEVENS-1745-1,25.209

<font> Betty . <$$font> You are mighty secret , Madam , me thinks , in
your Amours , not to call in to your Assistance any Confident .
STEVENS-1745-1,25.210

But , Madam , I have not been a Chamber-Maid so long , but I could have
told you , <paren> had Forwardness and impertinence belong'd to our
Sphere <$$paren> that you lov'd him , and <P_26> he you , long before
either of you told one another . STEVENS-1745-1,26.211

- As to <font> Juliana <$$font> , I@ @'ll attack her the Instant she
returns , or at least , the first convenient Opportunity .
STEVENS-1745-1,26.212

So , you may depend upon hearing the most intimate Secret of her Heart

But I fear , when you have , it will prove but a bitter Potion to you .

<font> Amar. <$$font> Oh , <font> Betty <$$font> , whenever you marry ,
let Love have the least Share in the Matrimonial Composition .
STEVENS-1745-1,26.215

- For could I but convey to you the least faint Idea of the unutterable
Anxieties I feel from this Suspicion only , I@ @'m sure it would learn

- Let Love have the least Share in the Matrimonial Composition .
STEVENS-1745-1,26.221

- Why , Madam , poor as I am , I would not marry a Man I did not love ,
had he the Riches of both the <font> Indies ; <$$font> tho' I were sure
to be made a Cripple by the Man I doated on before the Honey-moon was
over . STEVENS-1745-1,26.222

<font> Amar. <$$font> If you continue in this romantic Notion , <font>
Betty <$$font> , I doubt that will be thy Fate . STEVENS-1745-1,26.223

<font> Betty <$$font> Why , your Ladyship seems pretty much in the same

<font> Amar. <$$font> Oh , Child , 't@ @is that which gives me all this
Uneasiness : STEVENS-1745-1,26.225

might , perhaps , readily relinquish him , and make <font> Juliana
<$$font> happy in her Love ; STEVENS-1745-1,26.226

I have been catechising her Heart . STEVENS-1745-1,27.245

She has repeated to me her whole Creed in Love Affairs .

<font> Jul. <$$font> I do@ @n't know ; STEVENS-1745-1,28.266

<$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,28.269

- There had like to have been a Separation between my Lord and her this
last Week . STEVENS-1745-1,28.270

<font> Amar <$$font> How pray ? STEVENS-1745-1,28.271

<font> Jul. <$$font> Only his Lordship came home a little sooner than
she expected one Night , STEVENS-1745-1,28.272

and found her Ladyship with a Gentleman in her Chamber ;
STEVENS-1745-1,28.273

and his Lordship , not thinking such a Familiarity very decent there , -
had the Assurance to call them both to an Account .
STEVENS-1745-1,28.274

It happened the poor Gentleman look't as stupid as an Ass , and her
Ladyship , like an inrag'd Tygress . STEVENS-1745-1,28.275

His Lordship drew his Sword ; STEVENS-1745-1,28.276

but the Gentleman , chusing rather to submit himself to his Lordship's
Pleasure , than put <P_29> his Life to the Hazard of so dangerous an
Enterprize , suffer'd himself tamely to be kick'd down Stairs , and
stand the Correction of the Footmen below , who gave him a handsome Dose
, and turn'd him out of Doors , as frighten'd , as a Dog with an empty
Cannister at his Tail . STEVENS-1745-1,29.277

<font> Amar. <$$font> Well ! but the Consequences .
STEVENS-1745-1,29.278

<font> Jul. <$$font> Her Ladyship put on all the Wife ;
STEVENS-1745-1,29.279

was surpriz'd at his Impudence , in presuming to disturb {TEXT:dissturb}
her in her Privacies , without first enquiring whether she was busy or
not : - That her Chamber was her Asylum ; that she had no other Business
with the Gentleman , than to learn a new Song , - without which , it was
almost a Sin to go into , polite Company : - That he was an <font>
Italian <$$font> , and one of the last Men in the World she wou'd have
pitch'd upon to wrong his Honour , - and was she that Way inclin'd , she
had more Sense than to place the Scene of Action at home , - and that
she was determin'd , since he harbour'd so mean an Opinion of her Virtue
, upon so slight a Foundation , never to Bed with him from that Night ;
STEVENS-1745-1,29.280

and so left him . STEVENS-1745-1,29.281

<font> Amr. <$$font> God a Mercy , Lady <font> Spendthrift !
STEVENS-1745-1,29.282

<$$font> Well ! the Conclusion . STEVENS-1745-1,29.283

<font> Jul. <$$font> My Lord , as you know , being excessively fond of
her , has never had one Moment's Peace since ; STEVENS-1745-1,29.284

for she continued as obstinate as a <font> Jew ; <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,29.285

- but at last they capitulated upon these Terms , that his Lordship
should present her with a new Suit of Lac'd Night-Cloaths , the richest
that could be bought , against her second Wedding-Night , - and never
presume to enter her Chamber any more , without first enquiring whether
she was at leisure , upon Pain of her perpetual Displeasure .
STEVENS-1745-1,29.286

<P_30>

<font> Amar. <$$font> His Lordship certainly never agreed to the
Conditions . STEVENS-1745-1,30.288

<font> Jul. <$$font> O , joyfully , and readily .
STEVENS-1745-1,30.289

- The Story , I find is in every Body's Mouth ; STEVENS-1745-1,30.290

for she herself has already blaz'd it about among all her Acquaintance .
STEVENS-1745-1,30.291

<font> Amar. <$$font> O <font> Juliana <$$font> , to what a pitch of
Presumtion are the Wives of this Age arriv'd ! STEVENS-1745-1,30.292

I hope , if I know myself , whenever we enter that wisht-for State , we

STEVENS-1745-1,34.393

As they had some Knowledge of him , I suppose , they accepted of the
Offer ; STEVENS-1745-1,34.394

so their House being nearest , he , tho' against his Inclinations , I

nor do I desire any farther Knowledge of them than is consistent with my

- He laid hold of that Opportunity to press me to acquaint your Ladyship

STEVENS-1745-1,35.402

- and he did it with so soft , and so moving an Air , that had he said
but half so much in relation to myself , such a natural Hankering have I

If I mistake not , - you were saying last Night , that you had an

Pray which of them is your Flame ? STEVENS-1745-1,40.574

Or are you careless ? STEVENS-1745-1,40.575

Will either of them go down ? STEVENS-1745-1,40.576

<font> Easy . <$$font> Why , Sir <font> Charles <$$font> , as you are
my Father Confessor , I@ @'ll make no Scruple of owning to you , that I
have conceiv'd a Passion for <font> Juliana <$$font> , this long Time ;
STEVENS-1745-1,40.577

but my Father's inexcusable Temper is too well known .
STEVENS-1745-1,40.578

I have , therefore , hitherto chose to stifle my Inclinations , not
having it in my Power to make any honourable Propositions to her .
STEVENS-1745-1,40.579

- But pray , Sir <font> Charles <$$font> , what Reason could induce you
to draw this severe Confession from me ? STEVENS-1745-1,40.580

<P_41>

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> I@ @'ll be ingenous , <font> Ned . <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,41.582

I am a Slave , you must know , to <font> Amarinda <$$font> ,
STEVENS-1745-1,41.583

and was willing , therefore , to be satisfied with respect to the dear
Object of your Wishes . STEVENS-1745-1,41.584

As therefore , we are not Rivals , we may still continue Friends ;
STEVENS-1745-1,41.585

and to communicate a Secret to you , - <font> Amarinda <$$font> and I
have sign'd and seal'd our mutual Contract ; - tho' she has injoin'd me
to discover nothing by my Behaviour to her , that may give the least
Suspicion to her Sister . STEVENS-1745-1,41.586

- By this Method of proceeding , I am sorry to say , I believe <font>
Juliana <$$font> has a greater Respect for me than she ought .
STEVENS-1745-1,41.587

- But since I know your Mind , I@ @'ll soon give her some Distaste ,
STEVENS-1745-1,41.588

and I know her Spirit so well , that she@ @'ll readily marry you to be
reveng'd of me . STEVENS-1745-1,41.589

- So we may both succeed , and be happy . STEVENS-1745-1,41.590

I am to meet them To-morrow Evening at six , at the Backside of the Park
, where you may , as by Accident , meet us ; STEVENS-1745-1,41.591

and the Knowledge you already have of them , and the intimate Friendship
they know is subsisting between us , are Motives strong enough to
introduce you ; STEVENS-1745-1,41.592

and from thence we may proceed for the future . STEVENS-1745-1,41.593

- But be sure you make strong Love to <font> Juliana . <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,41.594

<font> Easy . <$$font> I am infinitely oblig'd to you , Sir <font>
Charles <$$font> , for your kind Proposal ; STEVENS-1745-1,41.595

but I fear 't@ @will look too mercenary to have no other View than her
Fortune , since I am satisfied my Father will come into no reasonable
Measures , whilst he lives . STEVENS-1745-1,41.596

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Do you but observe my Directions ,
STEVENS-1745-1,41.597

heard him talk more reasonable in my Life : STEVENS-1745-1,42.605

He spoke home to the Purpose . STEVENS-1745-1,42.606

- He told the Company indeed , that tho' you had been very extravagant ,
he was glad to hear you was grown wiser ; and consequent'y , knew better
how to behave , and live in the World ; and that if you persevered , he
would do every Thing in his Power to make you happy .
STEVENS-1745-1,42.607

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> No , <font> Ned <$$font> , it was spoke in
such Company , that I@ @'m confident he durst not go from his Word , for
his Honour . STEVENS-1745-1,42.609

STEVENS-1745-1,42.610

<font> Easy . <$$font> Well , Sir <font> Charles <$$font> , I shall
study to deserve this Friendship . STEVENS-1745-1,42.611

Never fear : I@ @'ll undertake to bring your Father over to Reason .

Amarinda . What@ @'s the Matter <font> Juliana ? <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,51.884

That Gaiety and Pleasantness , which us'd to triumph in your Countenance
, seems to be overcast To-day . STEVENS-1745-1,51.885

- I hope your Heart does not begin to repent of the Office your Eyes did
you , as you presag'd it would . STEVENS-1745-1,51.886

- <font> Jul. <$$font> As to that , Sister , tho' I have some Reason to
be a little out of Temper , at present , - It shall never give me any
great Uneasiness ; STEVENS-1745-1,51.887

for I was always determin'd to follow the Directions of a good old Song
. STEVENS-1745-1,51.888

<font> If he be kind , then I@ @'ll prove so ; STEVENS-1745-1,51.889

If he be false , I@ @'ll fit him too . <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,51.890

Should my Countenance seem any_ways dull at present , it takes not my
Heart , I@ @'ll assure you , into its Council . STEVENS-1745-1,51.891

<font> Amar. <$$font> I am glad to find you prudent enough to make so
happy a Resolution ; STEVENS-1745-1,51.892

and only wish you may be able always to keep it . STEVENS-1745-1,51.893

But Love is so severe a Wound , that it will never bear probing ;
STEVENS-1745-1,51.894

- and when once we find ourselves slighted by the Man we admire , all
those heroic Resolutions <P_52> generally vanish into Smoke ;
STEVENS-1745-1,52.895

and Woman will be uppermost in all our Sex - STEVENS-1745-1,52.896

But I was going to ask you if you were disposed to take a Turn in the
Park this Evening . STEVENS-1745-1,52.897

<font> Jul. <$$font> With all my Heart , in the Cool of the Evening .
STEVENS-1745-1,52.898

- <font> Jul. <$$font> That@ @'s the most pleasant Part of the Day .
STEVENS-1745-1,52.900

<font> Amar. <$$font> I am glad , my Dear , I have made the Proposition
; STEVENS-1745-1,52.901

and hope I shall see the Man favour'd in my Sister's Love .
STEVENS-1745-1,52.902

<font> Jul. <$$font> Nay , Sister , I have the most Reason to suspect
you of an Assignation , as you are the first Promoter .
STEVENS-1745-1,52.903

- But be that as it will , I shall be very glad to see my Brother Elect
. STEVENS-1745-1,52.904

<font> Amar. <$$font> Come , come , Sister , perhaps we may both see
the Man we love , and not unexpected neither . STEVENS-1745-1,52.905

STEVENS-1745-1,55.1000

'T@ @is just my own Reason . STEVENS-1745-1,55.1001

- Tho' Curiosity indeed is natural to our Sex , yet I declare I never
had the least Inclination to see one . STEVENS-1745-1,55.1002

I have enquired of those who frequented them , STEVENS-1745-1,55.1003

but never was answer'd in a more reasonable Manner , than Oh ! it was
transporting . - O ! I could not refrain from Tears ; and the like .
STEVENS-1745-1,55.1004

of no Taste , there is nothing more disagreeable or insipid .
STEVENS-1745-1,55.1005

Were I inclin'd to pass away an <P_56> Evening , it should always be at
one of our own Theatres , where I@ @'m sure to understand what I@ @'m
merry or sad for ; STEVENS-1745-1,56.1006

- and those who laugh or cry , and they know not for what , in my weak
Opinion , forfeit their Reasons . STEVENS-1745-1,56.1007

<font> Jul. <$$font> Lord , Sister , how uncourtly you talk .
STEVENS-1745-1,56.1008

STEVENS-1745-1,56.1013

Have we not Objects of Pity enough at home ? STEVENS-1745-1,56.1014

- Wou'd the Quality but once contribute to the Necessities of some of
their poor Natives , we might hope to see <font> England <$$font>
flourish once again ; STEVENS-1745-1,56.1015

but instead of that , their Benevolence extends to none but Foreigners ,
who like idle Drones , only wait to plunder our industrious Bees of all
their Honey , and then return with heavy Purses and joyful Hearts into
their own Country ; - where , by <font> England <$$font> 's Folly , they
vie with any Nobleman of our Nation . STEVENS-1745-1,56.1016
