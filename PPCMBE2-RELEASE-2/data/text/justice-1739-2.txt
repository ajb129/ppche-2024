<$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,1.4

<$$heading>

<font> July <$$font> the Fourth ,
One_Thousand_Seven_Hundred_and_Thirty_Four , at Four in the Afternoon ,
I went on Board the Ship , call'd , <font> The <$$font> Petersburgh
<font> Frigat <$$font> ; the Commander Captain John Nansum .
JUSTICE-1739-2,1.6

There was on Board one Mrs. Trott , and her Daughter , whose Husband
was a Jeweller at <font> Petersburgh <$$font> ; and no other Passengers
, but these Ladies , and myself . JUSTICE-1739-2,1.7

We had two Mates , and twenty other Hands . JUSTICE-1739-2,1.8

As I had received but a mean and despicable Notion of the Sea , and of
all Things that were to be had there , in Respect to Cleanliness ; I
think my_self obliged to relate how agreeably I was disappointed .
JUSTICE-1739-2,1.9

At Six of the Clock we set Sail with a fair Wind , but a small Gale :
JUSTICE-1739-2,1.10

When we got to <font> Orford <$$font> Nest , we were becalm'd ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,1.11

and cast Anchor there . JUSTICE-1739-2,1.12

Our Cook <P_2> not being ready when we sailed , we came to that Place
without one . JUSTICE-1739-2,2.13

There being no Hopes of a Wind ; the Captain went on Shore in order to
get a Cook ; JUSTICE-1739-2,2.14

and was so obliging as to let us go with him ; which afforded us no
small Pleasure . JUSTICE-1739-2,2.15

Our Boat was hawl'd over a Beach ; upon which , by the Waves of the Sea
, are flung divers Sorts of Shells , Numbers of which we pick'd up ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,2.16

and then we cross'd a small River ; which brought us to the Town of
<font> Orford <$$font> , where we dined , and gave an Invitation to the
Clergyman and his Lady to dine with us ; JUSTICE-1739-2,2.17

but being engaged with Company that Day at home , begg'd our Excuse ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,2.18

and desired us to drink Tea with them , which we did .
JUSTICE-1739-2,2.19

The Clergyman@ @'s a Gentleman of very good Sense ; JUSTICE-1739-2,2.20

his Lady was an agreeable well-bred Woman . JUSTICE-1739-2,2.21

After Tea , she proposed taking a Walk to see the Town ; which Offer we
readily accepted . JUSTICE-1739-2,2.22

But I can@ @not say there was any thing remarkable , more than a very
fine new Pew in the Church for the Mayor and Aldermen , and some Relicks
of an old Monastery , a small Distance from the Church , which stands
upon a very high Precipice ; JUSTICE-1739-2,2.23

After our Walk , we return'd with the Gentleman and Lady to the Inn ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,2.24

and there met with the Captain , who had finished his Business .
JUSTICE-1739-2,2.25

We thank'd him for the many Favours they had conferr'd on us ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,2.26

took Leave , JUSTICE-1739-2,2.27

and hasten'd to the Boat . JUSTICE-1739-2,2.28

We got on <P_3> Board at Eight at Night , JUSTICE-1739-2,3.29

supp'd of a cold Leg of Lamb , Lobsters , and a Dish of Pease ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,3.30

at Eleven went to Bed , JUSTICE-1739-2,3.31

wak'd at Five , with an uncommon Noise , insomuch that I rung for the
Cabbin-Boy , to know what was the Matter ? Who answer'd , <font> Brave
News , Madam ! JUSTICE-1739-2,3.32

The Wind@ @'s come about ; JUSTICE-1739-2,3.33

and we are hawling up the Anchor . <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,3.34

I judg'd it proper to get up , and look about me ; JUSTICE-1739-2,3.35

for , I must confess , the Sea-Terms were such , that I could not
believe they talk'd <font> English . <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,3.36

I went upon Deck ; JUSTICE-1739-2,3.37

and , in a small Time , had the Happiness to see every Sail hoisted ,
and hear the Captain say to the Boy at the Helm , <font> Steady , my Lad
! Steady ! <$$font> Which is all can be wish'd for at Sea .
JUSTICE-1739-2,3.38

After being thus entertained , I went into the Cabbin to Breakfast ;
which was exceeding neat , and very genteely furnished with a rich
Crimson Damask ; and very handsome China , Glass , and Sconces , with
gilt Frames : JUSTICE-1739-2,3.39

The Mouldings of the Wainscot were gilt with Gold ; JUSTICE-1739-2,3.40

and the Tea Things were set in the same Order , as if we had been at
Land : JUSTICE-1739-2,3.41

And I can@ @not say but every Thing we had was very agreeable , and the
Reverse of what I expected . JUSTICE-1739-2,3.42

We dined constantly at One o' Clock ; JUSTICE-1739-2,3.43

and generally had three Dishes . JUSTICE-1739-2,3.44

Our Diversion was mostly Reading , sometimes Fishing .
JUSTICE-1739-2,3.45

We caught an_hundred Mackerel in a Morning , some of which we fryed ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,3.46

some we boyled , JUSTICE-1739-2,3.47

some dry'd in the Sun , JUSTICE-1739-2,3.48

and <P_4> the other we souced . JUSTICE-1739-2,4.49

We were blest with fine Weather , but small Gales of Wind .
JUSTICE-1739-2,4.50

We were a Fortnight in our Passage to <font> Elsinore <$$font> , a Place
in the King of <font> Denmark@ @'s <$$font> Dominions , half Way to
<font> Russia <$$font> , where the Captains are obliged to go a Shore ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,4.51

and as the Wind was not fair , we had an Opportunity of going with him .
JUSTICE-1739-2,4.52

We dined at an <font> English <$$font> House , where we were elegantly
entertained . JUSTICE-1739-2,4.53

We took a Walk about the Town . JUSTICE-1739-2,4.54

The Dresses of the People are exactly the same with the <font> Palatines
. <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,4.55

We happened to pass by where the Soldiers were exercising ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,4.56

and observed them to be little dirty Fellows . JUSTICE-1739-2,4.57

After this , we came to the Church : The Outside of which did not tempt
me to take a View of the Inside ; JUSTICE-1739-2,4.58

but , being desired , could not refuse the Civility of the Stranger ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,4.59

and I found it much beyond my Expectation . JUSTICE-1739-2,4.60

The Altar is very spacious : JUSTICE-1739-2,4.61

The Table is covered with a Carpet . JUSTICE-1739-2,4.62

There was on it two large Gold Candlesticks , with Wax-Lights ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,4.63

and they were twisted round with Crape , and adorned with Flowers .
JUSTICE-1739-2,4.64

They were the Gift of the <font> English <$$font> Interpreter at the
Death of his Wife , who was a beautiful Lady of Nineteen , and died in
Child-Bed of her first Child . JUSTICE-1739-2,4.65

There is a very handsome Place in the Church , where she is interred ,
that is constantly kept covered with Flowers , or Box , according to the
Season of the Year . JUSTICE-1739-2,4.66

Over the Table is carved in Wood the Lord's Supper ; and , <P_5> over
that , his Ascension into Heaven : JUSTICE-1739-2,5.67

It@ @'s railed in with Brass Pillars , JUSTICE-1739-2,5.68

and opens with Folding-Doors : JUSTICE-1739-2,5.69

There@ @'s two Rows of Pews down the Middle ; JUSTICE-1739-2,5.70

and , at the lower End , fronting the Altar , there@ @'s a large Pew for
the Common People . JUSTICE-1739-2,5.71

On the Left Hand , there@ @'s a Place railed in ; and in it a very fine
Brass Font , which has on it all the Coats of Arms belonging to the
Gentlemen who gave it ; JUSTICE-1739-2,5.72

and there is near this Place a Pew , where the Bishop sits .
JUSTICE-1739-2,5.73

There is over these Places an Organ ; the Pipes of which are Brass ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,5.74

and it is finely painted . JUSTICE-1739-2,5.75

On the Right Hand , there@ @'s a fine Tomb-Stone ; under which is
interred a Family belonging to that Place . JUSTICE-1739-2,5.76

Over it are three Pictures painted ; JUSTICE-1739-2,5.77

and Justice is well done in Stone . JUSTICE-1739-2,5.78

There is another of the same Nature that has St. <font> Peter <$$font>
and St. <font> Andrew <$$font> carved in Stone . JUSTICE-1739-2,5.79

There is fronting the Pulpit the Consul's Pew , which is lin'd with
Cross-Stitch ; JUSTICE-1739-2,5.80

and to the Pulpit is fasten'd Twelve Half-Hourly-Glasses .
JUSTICE-1739-2,5.81

After making these Observations , we met the Captain ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,5.82

and immediately went on Board ; JUSTICE-1739-2,5.83

for the Wind was changed , and fair for us . JUSTICE-1739-2,5.84

We had a fresh Gale ; JUSTICE-1739-2,5.85

and , 'till the next Day about three of the Clock , we sailed very
pleasantly ; JUSTICE-1739-2,5.86

but before Four we were in a violent Storm of Thunder , Lightning , Wind
and Rain . JUSTICE-1739-2,5.87

I heard nothing then but <font> Hard_a_Lee ! <$$font> and <font>
Hard_a_Weather ! <$$font> an uncomfortable Command !
JUSTICE-1739-2,5.88

and saw nothing <P_6> but the Sea blown by the tumultuous Winds into
Waves of a large Size , frothing and foaming with Rage :
JUSTICE-1739-2,6.89

But , thank God ! it continued but for two Hours , when the delightful
Sun appeared ; JUSTICE-1739-2,6.90

and the Mate began to call , <font> Thus , thus , my Lad ! <$$font>
Which good News I told Mrs. Trott , who had retir'd , that she might
not have a View of the dismal Scene of Things at that Juncture .
JUSTICE-1739-2,6.91

As soon as the Storm was over , and the Captain was come into the Cabbin
, she made her Appearance . JUSTICE-1739-2,6.92

<font> O good Captain <$$font> , said she , <font> are we out of Danger
? JUSTICE-1739-2,6.93

Yes , yes , Madam <$$font> , answer'd he , <font> this is nothing at all
. <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,6.94

We allow'd him to say so ; JUSTICE-1739-2,6.95

but could not join with him in thinking so . JUSTICE-1739-2,6.96

He then asked me , What I thought ? JUSTICE-1739-2,6.97

I told him , <font> That I really had been in so great a Surprize , that
I thought of nothing but the Works of God , and that it was marvellous
in our Eyes ! <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,6.98

I am sure it was in mine . JUSTICE-1739-2,6.99

He imagined after this I should be much frighted ; JUSTICE-1739-2,6.100

but I told him , <font> That as I trusted in that God who the Winds and
Sea obeyed , I should be a Stranger to Fear . <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,6.101

The Evening being pleasant , we went upon Deck ; JUSTICE-1739-2,6.102

and , like Sailors , forgetting our Sorrows , were very merry .
JUSTICE-1739-2,6.103

One of the Men told us , we might see <font> Hogland <$$font> ; which I
was very willing to believe , but could not discern myself .
JUSTICE-1739-2,6.104

However , it was true ; JUSTICE-1739-2,6.105

for we got there that Night , JUSTICE-1739-2,6.106

and were becalm'd . JUSTICE-1739-2,6.107

We cast Anchor , JUSTICE-1739-2,6.108

and lay three <P_7> Days Wind-bound . JUSTICE-1739-2,7.109

The next Day came another small Ship , which anchored near us .
JUSTICE-1739-2,7.110

The Commander came to see us ; JUSTICE-1739-2,7.111

and we were very sociable . JUSTICE-1739-2,7.112

We din'd and supp'd together . JUSTICE-1739-2,7.113

Here I saw nothing , but Rocks . JUSTICE-1739-2,7.114

The first Mate went ashore , JUSTICE-1739-2,7.115

and perceived two or three Men and Women , who offered him some Milk ,
which he accepted of ; JUSTICE-1739-2,7.116

and gave them some Tobacco and Bisket for it . JUSTICE-1739-2,7.117

He cou'd not understand their Language . JUSTICE-1739-2,7.118

There had been at that Place a Wreck : JUSTICE-1739-2,7.119

So he took up several Things , JUSTICE-1739-2,7.120

and brought them on Board . JUSTICE-1739-2,7.121

There was now a small Breeze of Wind , with which we put out to Sea ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,7.122

and it increasing , we made no Stop 'till we got to <font>
Crownstead-Mould <$$font> , the Harbour we design'd for ; which is about
Ten Leagues from <font> Petersburgh <$$font> ; at which Place we arrived
the 30th of <font> August <$$font> , 1734 . JUSTICE-1739-2,7.123

I should before have told you , for the Credit of our Captain , that all
<font> Sundays <$$font> were observed in as solemn a Manner as the Place
would permit : JUSTICE-1739-2,7.124

The People of the Watch employed themselves in reading good Books ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,7.125

and the Decks were on those Days strow'd with Sand ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,7.126

and the Sailors were shaved , and very clean . JUSTICE-1739-2,7.127

<font> Crownstead <$$font> is the Place where all the large Ships lay ;
which , by Reason of their Bigness , can@ @not get up to <font>
Petersburgh . <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,7.128

There is a Custom-house ; JUSTICE-1739-2,7.129

and as soon as the Ships come in , the Custom-house Officers go on Board
, JUSTICE-1739-2,7.130

and <P_8> place a Soldier there , to see that nothing is carried out of
the Ship . JUSTICE-1739-2,8.131

I observed when they carried the Candles in , they were set in Plates
with Water in them . JUSTICE-1739-2,8.132

My Curiosity led me to ask the Occasion of so particular a Thing ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,8.133

and they told me , That the Captain must pay a Strof of Ten Rubles if
they were not ; which is almost Fifty Shillings English Money .
JUSTICE-1739-2,8.134

The Place being liable to Fires , they will not allow them to kindle any
on Board their Ships : JUSTICE-1739-2,8.135

But , to make up the Deficiency , there is an House built by her Majesty
on purpose to cook in . JUSTICE-1739-2,8.136

There resides at this Place Admiral Gordon , a <font> Scotch <$$font>
Gentleman ; who is esteem'd by all who have the Honour to know him , and
is as Good as He is Great . JUSTICE-1739-2,8.137

The Unfortunate and Just are always the Objects of his Favour .
JUSTICE-1739-2,8.138

The Great Post he has been employ'd in , has been performed with so much
Justice , Honour , and Courage , that his very Name gives Spirits to his
Officers , and animates his Sailors . JUSTICE-1739-2,8.139

I had the Honour to dine there before I went to <font> Petersburgh
<$$font> ; from which Favour I did not only partake of his splendid
Table , but saw his courtesy to Strangers , and the Pleasure he had in
seeing and receiving the Compliments of the <font> English . <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,8.140

He has a Daughter , who marry'd Sir <font> Henry Sterling . <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,8.141

They are blessed with all the Perfections to be wish'd for ;
particularly Affability , which in Persons of their Rank is a great
Beauty : JUSTICE-1739-2,8.142

And tho' I was a Stranger , <P_9> they were pleased not only to shew me
Civility , JUSTICE-1739-2,9.143

but added to it by doing me a greater Favour , in making me an handsome
Present . JUSTICE-1739-2,9.144

We stayed at this Place Wind-bound 'till the 11th of <font> August .
<$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,9.145

Being desirous of getting to <font> Petersburgh <$$font> , we attempted
to go up in a Boat ; JUSTICE-1739-2,9.146

but before we got a League , our Sailors all said , It was impossible
for them to get her up ; JUSTICE-1739-2,9.147

and the Captain himself thought the same : JUSTICE-1739-2,9.148

So we returned to the Ship , JUSTICE-1739-2,9.149

and took the Lady , who sailed with us , into the Boat ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,9.150

for she had not Courage enough to attempt going to <font> Petersburgh
<$$font> in it : JUSTICE-1739-2,9.151

But as we were now only to cross the River to a Place called <font>
Peterhuff <$$font> she honour'd us with her Company ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,9.152

and we arrived safe at the above-mentioned Place , which is a Palace of
her Imperial Majesty , where she at that Time was , and where she every
Summer went to , in the Month of <font> July <$$font> , and stay'd
generally for about Ten Weeks . JUSTICE-1739-2,9.153

I thought myself very lucky in having an Opportunity of seeing so fine a
Place as that really is ; and at the same time to have the Favour of
seeing Numbers of the Courtiers ; which I did , many of them walking in
the Gardens . JUSTICE-1739-2,9.154

This Place is by some thought to excell even <font> Versailles <$$font>
in Water-Works ; especially by those who have seen both :
JUSTICE-1739-2,9.155

But , as to my part , having only view'd those of <font> Peterhuff
<$$font> , so I can only say they are so fine , as they are beyond
<P_10> my Capacity to give a Description of . JUSTICE-1739-2,10.156

As to the Gardens , they indeed do not equal what we have in <font>
England . <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,10.157

What I really thought the most curious , were , Partitions made , in the
Walks , of a great Height , and different Shapes , with Oyster-Shells ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,10.158

and I must confess them both odd and beautiful . JUSTICE-1739-2,10.159

There are many fine Statues ; and great Numbers of Trees , cut in
various Forms . JUSTICE-1739-2,10.160

The Palace is very magnificent , JUSTICE-1739-2,10.161

and stands on a great Ascent . JUSTICE-1739-2,10.162

But her Majesty being there , I did not see the Inside of it .
JUSTICE-1739-2,10.163

We set out from this Place at Five o' Clock , in a Coach , as they call
it ; tho' had it been in <font> England <$$font> , it would only have
been accounted an open Chaise . JUSTICE-1739-2,10.164

The Coachman was of <font> Russia <$$font> , as were the other Servants
. JUSTICE-1739-2,10.165

I observed , whenever we came to a Wisbe , or Coback , which in that
Country is what we call in <font> England <$$font> an Inn , we never
pass'd any , without stopping . JUSTICE-1739-2,10.166

Either the Master , or the Man , wanted some Refreshment ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,10.167

and I remark'd likewise , they made use of one or two Words at each
Place ; JUSTICE-1739-2,10.168

and that being often repeated , I said , <font> I could talk <$$font>
Rush , <font> if I did but know the <$$font> English <font> of it .
<$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,10.169

I asked the Interpreter the Meaning of them ? JUSTICE-1739-2,10.170

He told me , One was <font> Good <$$font> ; the Other , <font> Very Good
. <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,10.171

I was pleased I made such a Beginning in the Language ; reflecting on
the <font> English <$$font> Proverb , <font> That a good Beginning makes
a good Ending . <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,10.172

But , now to my Journey <P_11> again . JUSTICE-1739-2,11.173

All that could be had at these Places were Drams of different Sorts : So
that by the Time we got to <font> Petersburgh <$$font> it was Twelve a
Clock , and our Servants much fitter for their Beds , than any further
Journey : JUSTICE-1739-2,11.174

And we were so fatigued , that we soon took Leave , and retired .
JUSTICE-1739-2,11.175

I arose at Seven , JUSTICE-1739-2,11.176

took a Walk out 'till near Nine , JUSTICE-1739-2,11.177

kept my Thoughts to my_self , JUSTICE-1739-2,11.178

and returned to the House of the Lady who was my Fellow-Traveller , at
whose Habitation I stayed that Night . JUSTICE-1739-2,11.179

About Ten in the Morning , Mr. Evans , to whose Daughters I went to
<font> Petersburgh <$$font> to be Governess , came for me ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,11.180

and I went with him , JUSTICE-1739-2,11.181

and was received both in a polite and kind Manner .
JUSTICE-1739-2,11.182

There were two Gentlemen , who supp'd with us ; both of which did Honour
to their Country : JUSTICE-1739-2,11.183

They were <font> English <$$font> , and Men of admirable good Sense .
JUSTICE-1739-2,11.184

Our Topick that Night was on <font> Old England <$$font> , and my Voyage
. JUSTICE-1739-2,11.185

We spent the Evening very merrily ; JUSTICE-1739-2,11.186

and about Eight the next Morning I rose , JUSTICE-1739-2,11.187

and was very well entertained with the young Ladies , who were to be
placed under my Care . JUSTICE-1739-2,11.188

My Thoughts were now altogether taken up with the Great Employ I was
going to enter upon , which was that of a Governess :
JUSTICE-1739-2,11.189

But on that Subject I shall say no more ; only desire any , <P_12> whose
Curiosity wants to be informed on that Point , to enquire of Mr. Evans
, in whose Family I was for three Years , and three Months :
JUSTICE-1739-2,12.190

And if I had not received a Letter from <font> England <$$font> to
return to be an Assistant to my own Children , I should have been there
'till now . JUSTICE-1739-2,12.191

<font> Petersburgh <$$font> is a Place of Her Imperial Majesty's
Residence for about Nine Months in the Year . JUSTICE-1739-2,12.192

It is very large , JUSTICE-1739-2,12.193

and is about Eight_Hundred Verse from <font> Musco <$$font> ; one Verse
being equal to Three Quarters of an English Mile .
JUSTICE-1739-2,12.194

<font> Musco <$$font> is the Metropolis : JUSTICE-1739-2,12.195

They , generally , once a Year , talk of Her Majesty's going there ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,12.196

but while I continu'd , I found it only Talk . JUSTICE-1739-2,12.197

Her Majesty is tall , and very lusty ; JUSTICE-1739-2,12.198

and has an Aspect becoming a Crowned Head . JUSTICE-1739-2,12.199

She has both Majesty and Sweetness in her Countenance ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,12.200

She lives up to the Rules of her Religion : JUSTICE-1739-2,12.201

She has Courage unusual to be found in her Sex ; JUSTICE-1739-2,12.202

and she has in Her all the good Qualities that in a Princess can be
wish'd for ; JUSTICE-1739-2,12.203

and tho' absolute , yet she is always merciful . JUSTICE-1739-2,12.204

Her Court is very splendid : JUSTICE-1739-2,12.205

Many of the Nobles are Foreigners . JUSTICE-1739-2,12.206

There is a Drawing-Room twice a Week ; JUSTICE-1739-2,12.207

but none are admitted , but those who belong to the Court ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,12.208

and they go between Three and Four in the Afternoon ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,12.209

and break up about Nine . JUSTICE-1739-2,12.210

Her Majesty rises very early , JUSTICE-1739-2,12.211

and dines at Twelve in Winter . JUSTICE-1739-2,12.212

For her Entertainment , there are twice a Week <font> Italian <$$font>
Opera's , which <P_13> are at Her Majesty's Expence
JUSTICE-1739-2,13.213

and none can be admitted but those who have a Ticket .
JUSTICE-1739-2,13.214

I had the Honour to see Her Majesty twice at the <font> Opera .
<$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,13.215

She was each Time in <font> French <$$font> Night-Gowns of plain
Paduasay . JUSTICE-1739-2,13.216

She had on her Head a Cambrick Handkerchief ; upon which was what there
is called an <font> Aspadilly <$$font> Cap of fine Lace , and a Crochet
of Diamonds on one Side . JUSTICE-1739-2,13.217

Her Majesty was handed in by the Prince of <font> Courland <$$font> ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,13.218

the two Princes followed her ; then the rest of the Nobility .
JUSTICE-1739-2,13.219

There were three Chairs in the Center of the Pit : JUSTICE-1739-2,13.220

In the Middle sat her Majesty , and on each Side the Princesses :
JUSTICE-1739-2,13.221

They were in high Dress . JUSTICE-1739-2,13.222

Princess Anne was in Crimson Velvet , imbroider'd richly with Gold ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,13.223

It was made like a Child's Coat : JUSTICE-1739-2,13.224

She had a long Train , and a very large Hoop : JUSTICE-1739-2,13.225

Her Hair was curled all round . JUSTICE-1739-2,13.226

She had a fine Laced Head ; JUSTICE-1739-2,13.227

and the Lappits were pinn'd up ; so as about a Quarter of a Yard hung
down . JUSTICE-1739-2,13.228

Her Tucker was gathered with Silk , and set close to her Neck .
JUSTICE-1739-2,13.229

She had Four Double Ruffles , JUSTICE-1739-2,13.230

had both Diamonds and Pearls on her Head , and Bracelets on her Hands ,
which were Diamonds . JUSTICE-1739-2,13.231

Princess Elizabeth had on a Gold and Silver Stuff ; and nothing else
different from the Dress of Princess Anne . JUSTICE-1739-2,13.232

The Cloaths of the Nobility , both Gentlemen and Ladies , were very rich
. JUSTICE-1739-2,13.233

Several of the Ladies were in Velvet ; JUSTICE-1739-2,13.234

and most of 'em had Pearls of a large <P_14> Size on the Robing and
Facing of their Gowns . JUSTICE-1739-2,14.235

Others had plain Paduasay trim'd with the <font> Point_de_Span .
<$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,14.236

The Gentlemen in general had Velvet , embroidered with Gold and Silver ;
in which Work the <font> Russians <$$font> are famous ; as also for
Grandeur and Show . JUSTICE-1739-2,14.237

I think that Court can@ @not be excelled : JUSTICE-1739-2,14.238

The Theatre is large , and lofty : JUSTICE-1739-2,14.239

It is commodiously kept warm by Eight Ovens . JUSTICE-1739-2,14.240

Their Scenes are very good ; their Dress rich ; JUSTICE-1739-2,14.241

and the Comedians , both Men and Women , had fine Voices .
JUSTICE-1739-2,14.242

They have sometimes <font> Dutch <$$font> Plays ; JUSTICE-1739-2,14.243

but I think no Body would chuse to see them twice .
JUSTICE-1739-2,14.244

As to their Dresses , they are to be compared to those of an Assembly of
all Nations , where every one appears in the Dress of their own Country
. JUSTICE-1739-2,14.245

The Habit of a <font> Russian <$$font> Woman is a <font> French <$$font>
Night-Gown ; JUSTICE-1739-2,14.246

and on their Heads they wear a Cap with a Bit of Velvet , Cloth , or
rich Silk , turn'd up with Furr , about half a Quarter deep , very
indifferent Linnen , and seldom any Shoes or Stockings .
JUSTICE-1739-2,14.247

A married Woman has her Hair put under her Cap ; so that you can@ @not
see any she has , tho' there is not one but has very long Hair :
JUSTICE-1739-2,14.248

But it is not thought decent for a married Woman to let any be seen .
JUSTICE-1739-2,14.249

As for the Unmarried , they tye theirs {TEXT:their's} back with a Ribbon
, JUSTICE-1739-2,14.250

and braid {TEXT:bread} it ; JUSTICE-1739-2,14.251

and upon their Forehead , they wear a broad Piece of Silver or Gold-Lace
, tied with a Ribbon , <P_15> a Jacket without Sleeves ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,15.252

and their Petticoats are generally made of something very gaudy .
JUSTICE-1739-2,15.253

Even the poor People wear a Cap , which is stiffened before with
Pasteboard , and stands up from their Forehead about Half a Quarter ;
upon which they put Beads , Gold , or Silver Lace , or any Thing that
looks fine ; JUSTICE-1739-2,15.254

and over these Caps , they hang a Piece of Cloth , Silk , or Callicoe ,
about a Yard long , holding two of the Corners in their Hands ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,15.255

and the other hangs over their Shoulders . JUSTICE-1739-2,15.256

In the Winter , they wear a Cloak , lined with rich Furr , which reaches
to their Wastes {COM:sic} ; JUSTICE-1739-2,15.257

and some will wear them in Summer , as they say , to keep out the Heat ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,15.258

but I am of Opinion it is to show them , they being commonly made of
rich Silk ; JUSTICE-1739-2,15.259

and they will have a fine Cloak and Cap , tho' they are not worth one
Penny of Money more , than what they give for them .
JUSTICE-1739-2,15.260

I observ'd , they need not lay by much to provide for Food ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,15.261

for they can make an hearty Meal on a Piece of black sour Bread , some
Salt , an Onion , or Garlick . JUSTICE-1739-2,15.262

As to Drink , they love the strongest Liquor they can get ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,15.263

and if they can@ @not obtain it honestly , they will steal it ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,15.264

for they will not be debarr'd from this Sort of Intemperance .
JUSTICE-1739-2,15.265

But the Liquor , commonly sold for the Use of <P_16> poor People , is
<font> Quash <$$font> ; compounded of Water that is thrown upon the Malt
after the Goodness is drawn off ; and runs upon several Sorts of Herbs ,
as Thyme , Mint , Sweet <font> Marjorum <$$font> , and Balm .
JUSTICE-1739-2,16.266

They have Fish in great Plenty . JUSTICE-1739-2,16.267

I saw finer Smelts there , than ever I did in <font> England <$$font> ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,16.268

and Twenty of them sold for a Copeak , which is equal to a Penny .
JUSTICE-1739-2,16.269

The Price of Salmon is Three Copeaks each Pound . JUSTICE-1739-2,16.270

They have amongst their Finny Train a Fish call'd <font> Carross
<$$font> , which is excellently good , not unlike our Soles :
JUSTICE-1739-2,16.271

But , what appears to me the most valuable , is what they call the
<font> Sterlate : <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,16.272

They cost Five or Six Rubles , which amount to near Thirty Shillings
a-piece . JUSTICE-1739-2,16.273

They are very luscious ; JUSTICE-1739-2,16.274

and the Water , in which they are boiled , appears as yellow as Gold .
JUSTICE-1739-2,16.275

They eat them with nothing but Vinegar , Pepper , and Salt .
JUSTICE-1739-2,16.276

They have exceeding fine <font> Sudacks <$$font> , and <font> Caveer
<$$font> ; which is the Row of a Sturgeon . JUSTICE-1739-2,16.277

They press a great deal of it , JUSTICE-1739-2,16.278

and send it to <font> England : <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,16.279

But that is not to be compared with what we have there .
JUSTICE-1739-2,16.280

It is eat upon Toasted Bread , with Pepper and Salt ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,16.281

and has the Taste of a fine Oyster . JUSTICE-1739-2,16.282

The Craw Fish is larger than ever I saw in <font> England . <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,16.283

I have dined with <font> Russians <$$font> in <font> Lent <$$font> ; and
seen them eat heartily of a Jole of Salmon raw . JUSTICE-1739-2,16.284

They take the Skin off , JUSTICE-1739-2,16.285

cut it into <P_17> large Pieces ; JUSTICE-1739-2,17.286

and in a Plate they mix a great deal of Oyl , Vinegar , Salt , and
Pepper ; JUSTICE-1739-2,17.287

and then pour it over the Salmon . JUSTICE-1739-2,17.288

They fry their Fish in Oyl : JUSTICE-1739-2,17.289

And have a small Fish , very like our Shrimps ; which are fry'd , and
served up in the Dish they are cooked in . JUSTICE-1739-2,17.290

The Nicety of them is to have them hot and crisp .
JUSTICE-1739-2,17.291

There is great Plenty of fine Meat : JUSTICE-1739-2,17.292

Their Mutton is but small ; yet very sweet , and fat .
JUSTICE-1739-2,17.293

There@ @'s very good Veal , JUSTICE-1739-2,17.294

but it is scarce ; JUSTICE-1739-2,17.295

Their Beef is excellently good , and cheap . JUSTICE-1739-2,17.296

They have also fine Pork ; JUSTICE-1739-2,17.297

and are very fond of Kids , which they have in great Plenty .
JUSTICE-1739-2,17.298

Their Lamb is good : JUSTICE-1739-2,17.299

Their Method of Cooking is Boiling , or Baking . JUSTICE-1739-2,17.300

They are great Lovers of Broth , which they make of the leanest Meat
they can get , JUSTICE-1739-2,17.301

and thicken it with Crop {TEXT:Croup} , instead of Oatmeal , which is of
the same Nature ; with good Store of Herbs , and Onions .
JUSTICE-1739-2,17.302

They often make their Fish into soups , omitting the Herbs .
JUSTICE-1739-2,17.303

I can@ @not say the <font> Russia <$$font> Manner of dressing it would
agree with me ; JUSTICE-1739-2,17.304

but I believe there is no Part of the World where the <font> English
<$$font> live better than they do at <font> Petersburgh . <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,17.305

There are great Numbers of Partridges and Wild-Fowl in general ;
particularly Snow-birds , which in <font> England <$$font> they call
<font> Orterlands . <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,17.306

They are but Ten Copeaks a Pair . JUSTICE-1739-2,17.307

They have like wise Turkeys , Chickens , <P_18> Pidgeons , and Rabbits .
JUSTICE-1739-2,18.308

Their Geese are very strong , and inferiour to ours .
JUSTICE-1739-2,18.309

They have great Numbers of Hares ; JUSTICE-1739-2,18.310

but I never eat of them . JUSTICE-1739-2,18.311

Their Skins are white . JUSTICE-1739-2,18.312

There@ @'s no Want of good Diet , no more than there is of good Liquor .
JUSTICE-1739-2,18.313

Claret , <font> Burgundy , Tokay <$$font> , Arrack , Brandy , with
several other fine Liquors , they have very reasonable .
JUSTICE-1739-2,18.314

As to the <font> Russia <$$font> Climate , it is extraordinary cold , as
you may imagine : JUSTICE-1739-2,18.315

For I saw Two_and_Thirty_Thousand Men exercised upon the Ice .
JUSTICE-1739-2,18.316

They are allowed to be good Soldiers : JUSTICE-1739-2,18.317

The Grenadiers wear Whiskers : JUSTICE-1739-2,18.318

The Officers Regimentals are Green trimm'd with Gold ; their Cockades
broad white Ribbons , and red Feathers . JUSTICE-1739-2,18.319

There are a great many <font> English <$$font> Gentlemen in Her
Majesty's Service . JUSTICE-1739-2,18.320

The common Men can go through great Hardships ; JUSTICE-1739-2,18.321

and will live in Places and on such mean Food , that would kill our
Natives . JUSTICE-1739-2,18.322

They are Strangers to Beds : JUSTICE-1739-2,18.323

They lie Sixteen or Twenty together upon Benches , or Pieces of Matting
, on the Floor . JUSTICE-1739-2,18.324

Her Majesty gives great Indulgence to her Officers , and Soldiers . To
the former especially : JUSTICE-1739-2,18.325

For if any Gentleman has a Difference with them , it is generally
decided in their Favour . JUSTICE-1739-2,18.326

They are a very strong lusty People ; JUSTICE-1739-2,18.327

and , when they have their Subes on , look very grand .
JUSTICE-1739-2,18.328

A Sube is a great Coat , or Cloak , made very long lined with Furr .
JUSTICE-1739-2,18.329

Every Family <P_19> has a certain Number quartered upon them , which is
a great Inconveniency : JUSTICE-1739-2,19.330

For they will make free with any Thing they can get .
JUSTICE-1739-2,19.331

But since the Treaty of Commerce , the <font> English <$$font> have got
off that Hardship ; JUSTICE-1739-2,19.332

Her Majesty is so gracious , as to allow an handsome Provision for the
Officers' {TEXT:Officers} Children after their Death , to their Sons
'till they are Twelve Years of Age ; and to their Daughters 'till they
are Fifteen . JUSTICE-1739-2,19.333

The Climate is so cold , as to freeze the Water into such a Substance of
Ice , as not only to bear such a Number of Men , but also Carriages of
all Sorts , laden with Goods every Day , drawn over it :
JUSTICE-1739-2,19.334

But indulgent Heaven , to make up this Severity , has given Plenty of
Wood , and Furrs , JUSTICE-1739-2,19.335

They travel in Sledges ; which is a Thing like an easy Chair .
JUSTICE-1739-2,19.336

The Bottom is Wood fix'd on to a Piece of Iron ; JUSTICE-1739-2,19.337

and before you is a Yodde-yold fastened to each Side of the Sledge , the
same as the Leather of our <font> English <$$font> Chaises ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,19.338

but this is Cloth lined with Furr . JUSTICE-1739-2,19.339

They have no Top to it : JUSTICE-1739-2,19.340

The Courtiers drive with white Sheets over their Horses , that the Snow
may not fly in their Faces : JUSTICE-1739-2,19.341

But this is not allow'd to any but those belonging to the Court .
JUSTICE-1739-2,19.342

The Horses are very little , yet strong , JUSTICE-1739-2,19.343

and go a great Pace : JUSTICE-1739-2,19.344

But the Nobility and People of Fashion have most of them English <P_20>
Horses : JUSTICE-1739-2,20.345

And it is customary to have two or four Riders , which are so many
Servants , who ride on Horseback before the Coach .
JUSTICE-1739-2,20.346

For Winter , when they go a Journey , they have what they call a
travelling Waggon ; in which they put their Beds , and Bedding .
JUSTICE-1739-2,20.347

They can either sit upright , or lie along , as they shall think
convenient . JUSTICE-1739-2,20.348

They generally take good Store of strong Liquor , Tongues , Hung-Beef ,
or any Thing that is potted : JUSTICE-1739-2,20.349

For there is but bad Entertainment upon the Road : JUSTICE-1739-2,20.350

They travel Night and Day . JUSTICE-1739-2,20.351

This is what I have been told ; JUSTICE-1739-2,20.352

for I never went a Journey while I was there . JUSTICE-1739-2,20.353

The Houses , which have been erected for many Years , are very low , and
built with Wood . JUSTICE-1739-2,20.354

The Rooms are all on a Floor : JUSTICE-1739-2,20.355

But Houses of a modern Structure are very lofty . JUSTICE-1739-2,20.356

These are called <font> Perlots <$$font> , raised with Stone , very
magnificent , but exceeding cold . JUSTICE-1739-2,20.357

The Method they have in keeping their Rooms warm , is by a <font> Peach
<$$font> , as they call it , in their best Rooms .
JUSTICE-1739-2,20.358

They are built with fine <font> Dutch <$$font> Tyles ; in others , only
Brick . JUSTICE-1739-2,20.359

It is a Sort of Oven ; JUSTICE-1739-2,20.360

and there is a Servant , whose Business it is to attend them :
JUSTICE-1739-2,20.361

For they are very dangerous , if not rightly managed .
JUSTICE-1739-2,20.362

Whilst the Fire is burning , the Chimney is open on the Top :
JUSTICE-1739-2,20.363

And this Oven has an Iron Door , where they put in the Wood ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,20.364

and when it has burnt for <P_21> some time , they then break it with an
Iron very small , JUSTICE-1739-2,21.365

and let that remain , which is burnt to fine Embers .
JUSTICE-1739-2,21.366

What is not so , is taken out : JUSTICE-1739-2,21.367

For was a Piece unburnt to remain in , when they shut it , 't@ @would
strike you with a sudden violent Sickness ; which , should it happen in
the Night , might usher you into the Shades of Death .
JUSTICE-1739-2,21.368

When it is sufficiently burnt , they shut down the Top of the Chimney as
close as possible , which they cover with Sand , JUSTICE-1739-2,21.369

and the Door is shut close also . JUSTICE-1739-2,21.370

I must own it is a compleat Way of warming a Room .
JUSTICE-1739-2,21.371

Then their Windows are kept shut all Winter ; JUSTICE-1739-2,21.372

and between every Crevice is put so much Tow , as keeps out all Manner
of Air : JUSTICE-1739-2,21.373

And if there is any Part of the House , even the least Place , that has
any Opening , it is filled up in the same Manner .
JUSTICE-1739-2,21.374

There are People , whose proper Business it is , to do this , who are
called <font> Corkers <$$font> and have so much a Window , according to
its Proportion . JUSTICE-1739-2,21.375

As I have told you , that the Water all Winter is froze into a fixed
Substance , to bear so great a Weight upon it ; you will imagine that
they are at a Loss for Water ; JUSTICE-1739-2,21.376

But , indeed , they are not . JUSTICE-1739-2,21.377

For the poor People are employ'd in breaking of the Ice , in such Parts
of the River , which do not prejudice the Road ; JUSTICE-1739-2,21.378

and every Family pays a small Matter to these People for keeping it open
, where their Cloathes <P_22> are carried to be renched ; which , when
they come out of the Water , are so much frozen , that , before they can
be hung up , must be put into a warm Room to be thawed .
JUSTICE-1739-2,22.379

This severe Frost generally begins in the Mid'st of <font> November
<$$font> ; JUSTICE-1739-2,22.380

but in 1734 , it commenc'd on the 26th of <font> October . <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,22.381

However , that is not common . JUSTICE-1739-2,22.382

It continues 'till the 10th of <font> April <$$font> ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,22.383

and seldom varies above a Day or two from that Time :
JUSTICE-1739-2,22.384

And I was told , <font> That <$$font> Peter the Great <font> has gone to
the Citadel , which is cross the River , in his Sledge upon the Ice ;
and returned in his Chariot , the Ice being gone , when his Stay had
been only Two Hours . <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,22.385

But while I was there , no such Thing happened : JUSTICE-1739-2,22.386

For then , tho' the River opened , it was a Day or two before the Boats
could pass . JUSTICE-1739-2,22.387

But there is one Tomkin , who , upon opening of the River , goes with
several little Boats before Her Majesty's Palace , and fires many small
Guns , as a Signal of Joy . JUSTICE-1739-2,22.388

In the Winter , they have very fine Illuminations , such as , I believe
, there is not the like in any Place . JUSTICE-1739-2,22.389

They are Four Times a Year : Upon her Majesty's Birth-Day , the Day she
was named , that of Her Coronation , and New-Year's Day ; the Yearly
Expence of which is Fifty_Thousand Pounds . JUSTICE-1739-2,22.390

There is always before the Palace some particular Figure remarkably fine
. JUSTICE-1739-2,22.391

I remember one Year there was Her <P_23> Majesty , with the Figure of
<font> Plenty <$$font> by Her ; JUSTICE-1739-2,23.392

and the <font> Motto <$$font> was , Beyond Praise .
JUSTICE-1739-2,23.393

Sometimes there are the Figures of <font> Charity <$$font> , and <font>
Justice . <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,23.394

I have seen several curious Representations , <font> viz. <$$font> A
Garden so natural , that you would imagine you might gather Oranges from
the Trees : The Walls of <font> Peru <$$font> , some of which appeared
to be broke down : Their Alphabet which consists of Forty Letters ; and
their Academy , which is likewise beautifully illuminated .
JUSTICE-1739-2,23.395

And , on the same Nights , they have very fine Rockets , and Bombs ;
which are play'd off before the Palace , not to be exceeded , if
equalled . JUSTICE-1739-2,23.396

Before any of these Nights , there is a Person sent with General Orders
for to put Lights into the Windows of their several Houses .
JUSTICE-1739-2,23.397

They frequently tell , How many : And , How long they must burn :
JUSTICE-1739-2,23.398

And there is a Person appointed to go about , and see that the Orders
are complied with : JUSTICE-1739-2,23.399

For , if they are not , the <font> General of the Policy <$$font> , who
has a Power equal to the Lord-Mayor of <font> London <$$font> , will lay
such a <font> Straffe <$$font> for such Default , as he thinks proper ;
which , in <font> English <$$font> would be called a Fine .
JUSTICE-1739-2,23.400

Another of their Amusements is in the Week before <font> Lent <$$font> ;
which the <font> Russians <$$font> call the <font> Butter-Week .
<$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,23.401

They go about three Miles out of Town , where the Hills are of great
Eminence ; JUSTICE-1739-2,23.402

and both Men , Women , and Children , divert themselves by sliding down
in Sledges . JUSTICE-1739-2,23.403

Some <P_24> will do it in a most dexterous Manner .
JUSTICE-1739-2,24.404

But there are generally great Numbers , who break their Legs , and Arms
. JUSTICE-1739-2,24.405

This Diversion is so highly honoured , as to have Her Majesty for a
Spectator . JUSTICE-1739-2,24.406

In this Week they indulge themselves in Eating and Drinking whatever
they like . JUSTICE-1739-2,24.407

They make Milk , Butter , and Eggs , very dear ; that , being a Food so
agreeable , they call it <font> Regaling <$$font> :
JUSTICE-1739-2,24.408

But , on the <font> Monday <$$font> before <font> Ash-Wednesday <$$font>
, their Mirth is at an End . JUSTICE-1739-2,24.409

On <font> Tuesday <$$font> , when any of them meet , they kiss each
other , JUSTICE-1739-2,24.410

and bid , <font> Adieu ! <$$font> saying , <font> To_Morrow I die !
<$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,24.411

and continue mortifying themselves 'till <font> Easter <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,24.412

They go to Church at Nights , as well as Days : JUSTICE-1739-2,24.413

Their Way of Worship is crossing themselves ; and bowing , and knocking
their Heads , to the Ground ; and at the same time often repeating these
Words as fast as possible , <font> Lord , have Mercy upon us ! <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,24.414

And They seem to be the most Religious , that say it the fastest .
JUSTICE-1739-2,24.415

They have in their Houses a great many painted and carved Images ; all
of which have Wax-Lights burning before them , from their going to
Church 'till they return home . JUSTICE-1739-2,24.416

They are very strict in keeping Fasts , by abstaining to eat , but not
so much in drinking : JUSTICE-1739-2,24.417

For there is none of them that ever will refuse Liquor , that ever I saw
. JUSTICE-1739-2,24.418

However , this Fasting is to be bought off . JUSTICE-1739-2,24.419

As for Instance there was a great Lady that chose a <font> Russian
<$$font> <P_25> Woman to be Nurse to her Child ; But did not approve of
her fasting ; JUSTICE-1739-2,25.420

and she , sooner than lose her Place , sent to the Priest ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,25.421

and he gave her Leave , on Condition of Satisfying his Demands ; which
she did , and had Absolution . JUSTICE-1739-2,25.422

Before they go to the Sacrament , for about a Week , they seem to be
very devout , and to be sorry for every Thing they have done amiss :
JUSTICE-1739-2,25.423

And the Servants , before they go , they come to their Masters , or
Mistresses ; JUSTICE-1739-2,25.424

ask Pardon for their Faults , JUSTICE-1739-2,25.425

and kiss their Hands : JUSTICE-1739-2,25.426

But , as soon as they have received it , return to their former ill
Behaviour ; JUSTICE-1739-2,25.427

and no Good is to be expected of them 'till the Time draws near for them
to receive it again . JUSTICE-1739-2,25.428

On <font> Easter <$$font> , about One or Two of the Clock in the Morning
, there are great Firing of Guns ; JUSTICE-1739-2,25.429

all the Cannons round the Citadel are fired ; JUSTICE-1739-2,25.430

and it is customary on that Day , and indeed all the Week , for the
<font> Russians <$$font> to pay Visits to the <font> English <$$font> ;
at the same time , to present them with an Egg ; and , when they give it
, say , <font> That <$$font> Christ <font> is risen . <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,25.431

There are Eggs , which are made great Curiosities .
JUSTICE-1739-2,25.432

I brought one over , that all the Figures upon it moved by pulling a
Tossel at the Bottom . JUSTICE-1739-2,25.433

It was a Turkey Egg , blown and painted a Cream_Colour , and varnished .
JUSTICE-1739-2,25.434

There are great Numbers of them : Some made in <P_26> Wax ; some in Wood
; and some that are real , and boiled hard ; and then painted red .
JUSTICE-1739-2,26.435

Afterwards , they will , with a Penknife , scrape so much of the Colour
off , as to leave the Figures of our <font> Blessed Saviour on the Cross
<$$font> , or <font> His Ascension into Heaven <$$font> , in a most
curious Manner . JUSTICE-1739-2,26.436

These are what are most admired ; JUSTICE-1739-2,26.437

but they will not keep . JUSTICE-1739-2,26.438

Their Servants make a Cake , or Pye ; which is garnished with Eggs ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,26.439

and present it to their Masters , or Ladies ; JUSTICE-1739-2,26.440

or else a Loaf of Bread : JUSTICE-1739-2,26.441

It is usual to give them something , tho' they do not accept of their
Present . JUSTICE-1739-2,26.442

This Week is generally and intirely devoted to Pleasure ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,26.443

and to be sober at this Time would be uncustomary .
JUSTICE-1739-2,26.444

From my Observation , I perceived they had very great Faith :
JUSTICE-1739-2,26.445

For , on the <font> Twelfth-Day <$$font> , the Water is consecrated by
the Priest ; JUSTICE-1739-2,26.446

and there is a Place erected upon the Ice for that Purpose round an Hole
, which is cut therein ; JUSTICE-1739-2,26.447

and , at that Time , People come far and near to have their Children
often dipt ; tho' , by such Ceremony , several are drown'd in that cold
Element . JUSTICE-1739-2,26.448

However , that they count as little , or nothing ; JUSTICE-1739-2,26.449

and comfort themselves with this Saying , <font> They are gone to
Almighty God ! <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,26.450

And there are a great many , both Old , and Young , who go with Pitchers
and Bottles for some of this Holy Water : JUSTICE-1739-2,26.451

For , if it does not cure them , they never seek further ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,26.452

and , after the Ceremony <P_27> is over there is a great Tub covered
with crimson Velvet , embroidered with Gold , and a deep Fringe upon it
, drawn by Six beautiful Horses , decked with Ribbons , to be filled
with Water for the Use of Her Majesty's Stables . JUSTICE-1739-2,27.453

There is another remarkable Thing in their Religion , which are Offices
in their Churches for Repose of the Souls of the Dead :
JUSTICE-1739-2,27.454

And they , at this Time , repeat the same for the Soul of the Emperor
<font> Peter <$$font> , each Night and Day , at a Monastery that is
about Two Miles from <font> Petersburgh : <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,27.455

And if any Person of Quality dies , they do the same for them a Year ,
and a Day . JUSTICE-1739-2,27.456

Their Priests are allowed to marry once : JUSTICE-1739-2,27.457

Their Dress is Black Cloth , which comes over their Heads :
JUSTICE-1739-2,27.458

They have long Beards ; JUSTICE-1739-2,27.459

and value themselves so much upon them , that , in Peter <font> the
Great@ <$$font> @'s Time , Numbers suffered themselves to be burnt ,
before they would be Shaved . JUSTICE-1739-2,27.460

As to their Christ'nings , I never was at one : JUSTICE-1739-2,27.461

But , by what I could learn , both Boys and Girls have Two Godfathers
and Godmothers ; JUSTICE-1739-2,27.462

and it is usual for them to make Presents to each other ; such as a fine
Purse , or Handkerchief , according to the Circumstances of those , who
give them : JUSTICE-1739-2,27.463

And it is also customary to make a Present to the Person that lies in .
JUSTICE-1739-2,27.464

They get over that Indisposition much better than the <font> English .
<$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,27.465

I have bought Things of a Woman <P_28> big with Child ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,28.466

and that Day Week the same Person has come to me , without any Shoes or
Stockings on , in the Midst of Winter , and told me , <font> She had
been brought to Bed , and was very well ! <$$font> Which is a common
Thing amongst the Women there . JUSTICE-1739-2,28.467

I was not at one of their Weddings ; JUSTICE-1739-2,28.468

but I saw Two or Three that were going to be married :
JUSTICE-1739-2,28.469

And I observed they were very finely dress'd , their Cloaths very rich ,
with Ribbons and Flowers in their Hair : JUSTICE-1739-2,28.470

For , on that Day , they will borrow of every one they can , in order to
be fine . JUSTICE-1739-2,28.471

There is a Person walks before the Bridegroom and Bride , with a little
Image , which is called her Tutelar God ; JUSTICE-1739-2,28.472

and , after she is married , it is brought back , and put amongst other
of their Gods ; JUSTICE-1739-2,28.473

but she prays no more to it . JUSTICE-1739-2,28.474

I did not see a Funeral 'till I had been there Two Years ; tho' I lived
in a very populous Part of the Town , and very near the Court :
JUSTICE-1739-2,28.475

Neither had I that Day seen one , but upon observing an uncommon Light .
JUSTICE-1739-2,28.476

On going to see what it was , I found it to be Numbers of Torches ,
which were carry'd before a Corps at Noon-Day . JUSTICE-1739-2,28.477

I thought this a great Absurdity : JUSTICE-1739-2,28.478

But one , I was in Company with , told me what they had in their Coffin
, which was more so : JUSTICE-1739-2,28.479

For there was a Pair of Shoes , some Candles , and a Pass .
JUSTICE-1739-2,28.480

The Pass was to get <P_29> them Admittance ; JUSTICE-1739-2,29.481

but whereto , I know not . JUSTICE-1739-2,29.482

I suppose they think there are several Degrees of Happiness :
JUSTICE-1739-2,29.483

For those Passes are to be bought at a Shop in the Market ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,29.484

and the Goodness of the Pass is in Proportion to the Price given .
JUSTICE-1739-2,29.485

One Day in the Year all the Widows go to cry over their Husbands'
{TEXT:Husbands} Graves ; JUSTICE-1739-2,29.486

and pray heartily to have their Sorrows mitigated , by quickly entering
into the Holy State . JUSTICE-1739-2,29.487

The Place is very healthful : JUSTICE-1739-2,29.488

There are no Apothecaries ; JUSTICE-1739-2,29.489

but there is a Shop , which is there call'd an <font> Optick <$$font> ,
belonging to Her Majesty , near the Court ; where may be bought such
Medicines as are wanted . JUSTICE-1739-2,29.490

There are several good Physicians , and Surgeons : JUSTICE-1739-2,29.491

And here are several Remarkables worthy of Notice , That very few grow
mad , or are guilty of Self-Murder : And I never saw either Man , Woman
, or Child , that were crooked . JUSTICE-1739-2,29.492

They have a Custom in the Country of making Fools the last Day of <font>
April <$$font> , as some People of <font> England <$$font> do on the
First : JUSTICE-1739-2,29.493

And , in the Year 1735 , Her Majesty was pleased to have the Bell to be
rung , which they call the Fire-Bell ; it being only toll'd when any
such direful Misfortune happens . JUSTICE-1739-2,29.494

This , indeed , did make a great Number of Fools , JUSTICE-1739-2,29.495

and occasion'd a great deal of Diversion : JUSTICE-1739-2,29.496

But , three Days after , the Steeple of one of their finest Churches
<P_30> was set on Fire by Lightning ; which was look'd upon as a
Judgment ; JUSTICE-1739-2,30.497

but now that ridiculous Custom is laid aside . JUSTICE-1739-2,30.498

There was another great Fire at <font> Musco <$$font> , which burnt
Seven Verse <paren> each , Three Quarters of an <font> English <$$font>
Mile <$$paren> in Length , and Five in Breadth . JUSTICE-1739-2,30.499

It was said , That Her Majesty's Loss amounted to Fifteen Millions of
Rubles Value , besides what the Subjects sustained .
JUSTICE-1739-2,30.500

Soon after this , there was a Fire broke out at <font> Petersburgh
<$$font> , whilst I was there ; which laid most of it in Ashes :
JUSTICE-1739-2,30.501

And I saw Hundreds in the Fields , with what they had saved ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,30.502

and had no Place to go to ; JUSTICE-1739-2,30.503

and , what was yet worse , several of those Houses , which were not
burnt , were ordered to be pulled down . JUSTICE-1739-2,30.504

And so they would have been , had not that noble Lord , who was
appointed to give this Order to the People , waited on Her Majesty , to
inform Her , <font> What a Hardship it would be to those poor Sufferers
! <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,30.505

And she was graciously pleased to let them remain for some Time .
JUSTICE-1739-2,30.506

Had it not happened in Summer , without doubt great Numbers had been
froze to Death . JUSTICE-1739-2,30.507

In the Year 1737 , there was a very particular Sickness .
JUSTICE-1739-2,30.508

I believe every one in the Place had it , tho' it only prov'd fatal to
young Children . JUSTICE-1739-2,30.509

They were taken with a violent Pain in their Backs ,
JUSTICE-1739-2,30.510

and were very cold and low spirited ; JUSTICE-1739-2,30.511

and , in a Night's Time , they became <P_31> extremely weak ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,31.512

and , at that Time , there was living one Dr. Putteller , who was
Physician to the <font> English <$$font> Factory ; JUSTICE-1739-2,31.513

and his Prescription for it was only to drink plentifully of Sack Whey ,
with Forty or Fifty Drops of Hartshorn ; and so in proportion to the
Ages and Strength of the Patients ; in order to sweat ; which proved
successful : JUSTICE-1739-2,31.514

But it was so violent , that in some of the Families of the Courtiers ,
in each of which were generally an_Hundred Persons , there were only
Three or Four able to go about it . JUSTICE-1739-2,31.515

However , it did not continue above a Week upon any Body .
JUSTICE-1739-2,31.516

If any one steal at a Fire , you may toss them into it , without any
more to do ; JUSTICE-1739-2,31.517

or if any takes Servants , and keeps them above Two Days in the House
before they have them registered in the Police , they will be obliged to
pay such a Fine , as the Master of the Police shall think fit .
JUSTICE-1739-2,31.518

If the Servants are guilty of any Faults , you may send to any Officer ,
and have them <font> Catted <$$font> ; that is , beaten with a
Cat-of-Nine-Tails , 'till their Backs run down with Blood .
JUSTICE-1739-2,31.519

But this they esteem as a trifling Punishment , JUSTICE-1739-2,31.520

and even make nothing of it : JUSTICE-1739-2,31.521

For they immediately rub their Backs with Brandy ; which , with often
doing , they become so hard , that they laugh at the Punishment .
JUSTICE-1739-2,31.522

Some are set alive in the Ground up to their Necks ; and Victuals at a
Distance : JUSTICE-1739-2,31.523

But then there is a <P_32> Guard to watch , that no Body gives them any
Thing . JUSTICE-1739-2,32.524

Another Punishment they have , which is , Distension of their several
Limbs , which are first dislocated , and then hung upon Spikes for a few
Minutes : JUSTICE-1739-2,32.525

And if they go through that Torture three Times , without confessing the
Crime they are accused of , the Prosecutors are liable to have the same
Punishment inflicted upon them . JUSTICE-1739-2,32.526

And I was told , that there have been Instances of innocent People
suffering it , thro' the Offenders enduring it the aforesaid Number of
Times . JUSTICE-1739-2,32.527

There is no such thing as going out of <font> Russia <$$font> , without
a Pass ; and some Body to be Security , that the Person , that does go ,
is not indebted to any one ; JUSTICE-1739-2,32.528

or else they beat a Drum , to give Notice ; JUSTICE-1739-2,32.529

and then they have no Occasion for any other Security :
JUSTICE-1739-2,32.530

But this is seldom done . JUSTICE-1739-2,32.531

If any Soldier has a Son , or Sons , they must all be Soldiers .
JUSTICE-1739-2,32.532

Whatever Employ the Father is of , the Son must be the same .
JUSTICE-1739-2,32.533

If any of Her Majesty's Nobles , or any other inferior Persons , who
have any Place in her Service , do any thing that she does not approve
of , they are not brought to any Tryal ; JUSTICE-1739-2,32.534

but she sends a Person to let them know , <font> She has no further
Service for them <$$font> ; and , <font> That they must quit their Place
<$$font> ; tho' they do not know what for : JUSTICE-1739-2,32.535

But this is a very kind Sentence . JUSTICE-1739-2,32.536

Sometimes they have two Days allow'd them ; and sometimes only a few
Hours : JUSTICE-1739-2,32.537

And , if any Person presume to go into Her Majesty's Presence <P_33> to
deliver a Petition to Her , or wears the Tips of Ermin , they are
punished with Death . JUSTICE-1739-2,33.538

The <font> Russians <$$font> are all born Slaves ; JUSTICE-1739-2,33.539

and are often bought , and sold : JUSTICE-1739-2,33.540

But none of them can be carry'd out of the Country .
JUSTICE-1739-2,33.541

There are {COM:sc._ones} of all Prices . JUSTICE-1739-2,33.542

I was told , That there was one Lady , who had Eight_Hundred of these
Slaves . JUSTICE-1739-2,33.543

She was looked upon as the greatest Fortune in <font> Russia . <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,33.544

All the Customs , due for Merchandize imported there , are to be paid in
Dollars ; without which , no Entry can be made at the Custom-House , or
the Merchants permitted to receive their Goods . JUSTICE-1739-2,33.545

They have Ducats , which are Pieces of Gold . JUSTICE-1739-2,33.546

They go for Two Rubles , and Ten Copeaks ; which there would be equal to
Half a Guinea . JUSTICE-1739-2,33.547

But in <font> England <$$font> I got only Nine Shillings for them .
JUSTICE-1739-2,33.548

It is very good Gold . JUSTICE-1739-2,33.549

Their Silver is very indifferent : JUSTICE-1739-2,33.550

They have Rubles , and Half Rubles . JUSTICE-1739-2,33.551

A Ruble is in Size exactly like our Crowns ; with the Impression of Her
Majesty's Head on one Side , and the Spread-Eagle on the Reverse .
JUSTICE-1739-2,33.552

In Exchange , a Ruble is worth no more than Four-@ @Shillings and
Six-Pence . JUSTICE-1739-2,33.553

There is Five Copeak Pieces of Copper , which are about Two-Pence
Half-Penny . JUSTICE-1739-2,33.554

The rest are Copeaks , Denniskeas , and Pullusekeys .
JUSTICE-1739-2,33.555

A Copeak is Two Denniskea's ; JUSTICE-1739-2,33.556

and two Pullesekeys <P_34> is one Denniskea . JUSTICE-1739-2,34.557

They are equal to our Pence , Half-Pence , and Farthings .
JUSTICE-1739-2,34.558

Their Pound is equal to Three Quarters of an <font> English <$$font>
Pound ; and so in proportion for lesser Weights : JUSTICE-1739-2,34.559

And , in selling any Silks or Cloth , they measure with an <font>
Archena <$$font> ; which is Three Quarters of an <font> English <$$font>
Yard . JUSTICE-1739-2,34.560

The Commodities which they commonly send to <font> England <$$font> are
Iron , Hemp , Pottash , Cloth and Furrs , <font> &c. <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,34.561

As I have given you a Description of their Winter , which is extreamly
cold ; I shall also {COM:sc._a_description} of their Summer , which
continues Four Months . <font> Viz. <$$font> May , June , July , and
August : JUSTICE-1739-2,34.562

But <font> June <$$font> , and <font> July <$$font> , are the most
severely hot . JUSTICE-1739-2,34.563

In these Two Months , they are very much troubled with what they call
<font> Muskettoes <$$font> , or named <font> Gnats <$$font> by us in
<font> England <$$font> ; JUSTICE-1739-2,34.564

and when you are bit by them , your Flesh will be in Bumps ; which will
be inflam'd , and itch violently . JUSTICE-1739-2,34.565

The Method the People there generally take to cure it , is , To rub the
Part affected with Brandy ; JUSTICE-1739-2,34.566

but that inflamed me the more . JUSTICE-1739-2,34.567

I used sour Milk ; JUSTICE-1739-2,34.568

and that I found better . JUSTICE-1739-2,34.569

There is abundance of Thunder and Lightning ; JUSTICE-1739-2,34.570

and the Claps of Thunder are much louder , and last longer , than any I
ever heard in <font> England . <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,34.571

There is often much Damage from Lightning , which abates the Pleasure of
the Summer ; and afterwards occasions <P_35> several Blights , by the
scorching Heats , which spoil the Woods for the Distance of several
Versts . JUSTICE-1739-2,35.572

Her Majesty is sometimes extreamly frighten'd at the excessive Lightning
. JUSTICE-1739-2,35.573

They have very little Rain , and scarce of Fruit .
JUSTICE-1739-2,35.574

Indeed , they have Strawberries of all Sorts , exceedingly good ; with
Plenty of Currants , and Gooseberries . JUSTICE-1739-2,35.575

Their Cherries are scarce , and very bad : JUSTICE-1739-2,35.576

They have some Pears , tho' very indifferent ; JUSTICE-1739-2,35.577

but they have an Apple , which is called a Transparent Apple ; and ,
when it is ripe , is so clear , that you may see the Kernels through it
: JUSTICE-1739-2,35.578

The Taste is superior to any Apple I ever met with in <font> England .
<$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,35.579

They have Plenty of <font> Asparagus , French <$$font> Beans , Spinage ,
and Salletting . JUSTICE-1739-2,35.580

Collyflowers are scarce : JUSTICE-1739-2,35.581

They have fine Cabbages ; and Plenty of them : JUSTICE-1739-2,35.582

The Seed comes from <font> Archangel . <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,35.583

Turnips and Carrots they have in Abundance . JUSTICE-1739-2,35.584

Their Diversion in Summer is going upon the Water in Barges ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,35.585

and , having Musick with them , sometimes they go Four or Five Miles out
of Town a fishing , carrying some Provisions with them ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,35.586

and have a Fire made in the Woods to dress the Fish they catch .
JUSTICE-1739-2,35.587

Another Diversion is going to see the Ships launched ; which , indeed ,
is very entertaining ; the Empress being always there .
JUSTICE-1739-2,35.588

Against that Time , there is a convenient Place , erected for Her
Majesty and Nobility , which is covered <P_36> with Scarlet , to see the
Ship launch'd ; JUSTICE-1739-2,36.589

and there is a Collation of Sweetmeats ; when also it is usual to drink
Success to the Ship's good going off . JUSTICE-1739-2,36.590

There are a great Number of Priests , and other Gentlemen , who are
launched in her . JUSTICE-1739-2,36.591

Near her going off , Her Majesty crosses Herself Three or Four Times to
pray for her good Success . JUSTICE-1739-2,36.592

There is Musick on Board which plays as soon as ever she is in the Water
; JUSTICE-1739-2,36.593

and then Her Majesty going to the Admiralty ; the Person , who built the
Ship , presents Her with a little Silver Hammer ; JUSTICE-1739-2,36.594

and she strikes the first Nail in that , building on the Stocks .
JUSTICE-1739-2,36.595

She did use to give a Piece of Plate ; JUSTICE-1739-2,36.596

but that Custom is left off . JUSTICE-1739-2,36.597

It is Her Pleasure to give as many Ducats as there are Guns :
JUSTICE-1739-2,36.598

But , while I was in <font> Russia <$$font> , there was one built , by
Mr. Brown , allowed by every Body to be as fine a Ship as could sail
upon the Ocean : JUSTICE-1739-2,36.599

Her Majesty did him the Honour to go on Board , JUSTICE-1739-2,36.600

and had a Ball ; JUSTICE-1739-2,36.601

and , at that Time , presented Him with a Gold Snuff-Box , worth Sixty
Pounds , besides Her Present of Ducats . JUSTICE-1739-2,36.602

He is an <font> English <$$font> Gentleman ; JUSTICE-1739-2,36.603

and has the Honour to hold several Places under Her Majesty , which he
executes with strict Virtue . JUSTICE-1739-2,36.604

All the Captains , I ever talked with , have asserted , that their Ships
are built as well as those <P_37> of our <font> English <$$font> ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,37.605

but confess , that the Wood will not last so long .
JUSTICE-1739-2,37.606

Their finest Buildings are Her Majesty's Palace , the Citadel , and the
Monastery . JUSTICE-1739-2,37.607

The Palace is very magnificent ; where Her Majesty gives Audience to all
publick Ministers ; and , upon some particular Days , dines there .
JUSTICE-1739-2,37.608

It is very large , and lofty . JUSTICE-1739-2,37.609

The Ceiling {TEXT:Cieling} is finely painted : JUSTICE-1739-2,37.610

The Throne is very spacious : JUSTICE-1739-2,37.611

The Canopy is richly embroidered with Gold , and a deep Gold Fringe :
JUSTICE-1739-2,37.612

The Chair , she sits in , is Velvet ; JUSTICE-1739-2,37.613

the Frame is Gold : JUSTICE-1739-2,37.614

And there are Two other Chairs , which are for the Princesses .
JUSTICE-1739-2,37.615

One Side of the Room is fine gilt Leather , in different beautiful
Representations ; JUSTICE-1739-2,37.616

and the other Side , being Looking-Glass <paren> with all Manner of
Birds near it <$$paren> afford a very pleasant Scene .
JUSTICE-1739-2,37.617

From the Window you have a fair View of the River , and Shipping .
JUSTICE-1739-2,37.618

The other Rooms are all hung ; some with Velvet , some with Gold and
Silver Stuffs . JUSTICE-1739-2,37.619

I saw Three Beds : One of which was Velvet ; JUSTICE-1739-2,37.620

the other Two were Damask : The former of a blue , and the latter of a
yellow Colour . JUSTICE-1739-2,37.621

The Cathedral Church , I was told , was very magnificently adorned ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,37.622

but I was never in it . JUSTICE-1739-2,37.623

It is beautify'd on the Top with a Spire , casting a charming Lustre ,
as well it may , being covered with resplendent Gold .
JUSTICE-1739-2,37.624

<P_38>

The Monastery <paren> situated by a fine River <$$paren> is exceeding
large , with extensive Apartments , displaying a venerable Aspect ,
thro' the Magnificence and stupendous Height of the Building .
JUSTICE-1739-2,38.626

It is inhabited by Monks . JUSTICE-1739-2,38.627

There is belonging to it a good Fishery ; to which Gentlemen and Ladies
often go , JUSTICE-1739-2,38.628

and make a Bargain with the Fishermen for a Draught in their Net .
JUSTICE-1739-2,38.629

There are great Plenty of Salmon in this Water . JUSTICE-1739-2,38.630

There is a House of Prince <font> Mentzecoff <$$font> 's , which for
Largeness is remarkable : JUSTICE-1739-2,38.631

It has as many Rooms in it , as there are Days in the Year .
JUSTICE-1739-2,38.632

That Prince is now under Banishment . JUSTICE-1739-2,38.633

In the Year 1735 , the <font> Persian <$$font> Ambassador made his
Publick Enterance ; when he had a Retinue of Five_Hundred Persons of his
own Natives , besides several of Her Majesty's Chariots and Servants to
attend him ; whilst His went empty . JUSTICE-1739-2,38.634

His Dress was Gold Tissue : JUSTICE-1739-2,38.635

He had on his Head a Turbant , on which were Numbers of Diamonds ; and
several Rows of large Pearl put over his Neck , hanging down like a
Chain . JUSTICE-1739-2,38.636

He was a comely Person ; JUSTICE-1739-2,38.637

and had a Pair of large Whiskers , which made him look very fierce .
JUSTICE-1739-2,38.638

He was tall , JUSTICE-1739-2,38.639

but stoop'd much in the Shoulders ; JUSTICE-1739-2,38.640

and I observ'd that all of them did the same . JUSTICE-1739-2,38.641

Whenever he went out , he had always one that carry'd his Pipe .
JUSTICE-1739-2,38.642

After he had been there about a Week , he waited again <P_39> on the
Empress , JUSTICE-1739-2,39.643

and made Her a Present of some very great Curiosities ; which were
carried in Trays upon the Heads of his own Domesticks , covered over
with <font> Persian <$$font> Silks . JUSTICE-1739-2,39.644

The Day being very windy , I saw Pearl of a very large Size , and <font>
Persian <$$font> Silks flowered with Gold and Silver .
JUSTICE-1739-2,39.645

He also made Her Majesty a Present of an Elephant , which was convey'd
to Court by a great Attendance , and had on his Back a Castle .
JUSTICE-1739-2,39.646

I did not see it 'till he return'd from Court ; JUSTICE-1739-2,39.647

and the Castle was left there . JUSTICE-1739-2,39.648

But I was told , by those that did , that it was richly embroider'd and
adorned with several fine Stones . JUSTICE-1739-2,39.649

There was a Man , that rid upon his Back , and had in his Hand a little
Dagger ; which he struck into his Neck , whenever he did wrong , in
order to manage him : JUSTICE-1739-2,39.650

His Food was Rice , and his Drink Brandy . JUSTICE-1739-2,39.651

The <font> Persians <$$font> worship the Sun : JUSTICE-1739-2,39.652

And as soon as that bright Luminary begins to bespangle the dewy Earth
with its oriental Beams ; then , in the House of the Ambassador ,
abundance of Lamps are lighted , in which they burn the sweetest Incense
. JUSTICE-1739-2,39.653

The Legate was alone in a Closet ; JUSTICE-1739-2,39.654

those that attended him were in a Balcony ; JUSTICE-1739-2,39.655

and his Domesticks stood in the Streets . JUSTICE-1739-2,39.656

Their Worship is chiefly in Chanting for about an Hour ; and the same
repeated at the Setting of the Sun . JUSTICE-1739-2,39.657

Many of them have very fine and melodious Voices .
JUSTICE-1739-2,39.658

<P_40>

There is the Honourable Mr. Roundeau , who is the <font> English
<$$font> Resident . JUSTICE-1739-2,40.660

He is a Gentleman , who hath the Esteem of all , that have the Honour to
know him ; and one that acts with the strictest Probity to all Mankind .
JUSTICE-1739-2,40.661

He has a Lady , who is adorn'd with every Perfection to be wish'd for in
her Sex . JUSTICE-1739-2,40.662

She has so large a Share of Sense , that it is only to be equalled , not
excelled : JUSTICE-1739-2,40.663

And this is known to those who have the Pleasure to converse with her ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,40.664

but {COM:sic} seems to be a Stranger to it herself .
JUSTICE-1739-2,40.665

Civility , Affability , and good Nature , are her daily Practices ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,40.666

and , in all her Answers , even to her Inferiors , she shows the
greatest Condescension , and most obliging Temper .
JUSTICE-1739-2,40.667

She is , in Person , a fine Woman ; very tall , and perfectly genteel .
JUSTICE-1739-2,40.668

There is , on the King's Birth-Day , at Mr. <font> Roundeau <$$font> 's
, every Year , both a splendid Entertainment , and a Ball ; to which the
<font> English <$$font> are invited . JUSTICE-1739-2,40.669

Having now represented several particular Customs and Laws of the <font>
Russians <$$font> , and given a true Description of many Occurrences I@
@'ve <P_41> made Observation of , in that cold Climate ; I think 't@ @is
not possible for a Woman to paint the various Seasons of the Year in
their proper Colours : JUSTICE-1739-2,41.670

But shall beg Leave to insert the following excellent Verses ; which
<paren> tho' wrote from <font> Copenhagen <$$font> by Mr. Philips
<$$paren> yet seem , in so peculiar a Manner , to be suited and adapted
to the <font> Czarina <$$font> 's Dominions , that I do not in the least
doubt but that they will be agreeable and entertaining to my candid
Readers . JUSTICE-1739-2,41.671

<P_43>

I left <font> Petersburgh <$$font> the 4th of <font> August <$$font> ,
1737 ; JUSTICE-1739-2,43.674

and got to <font> Crownstead <$$font> that Night .
JUSTICE-1739-2,43.675

I continu'd there Eight Days , at the House of Mrs. <font> Faukinburgh
<$$font> , whose Son was Aide-de-Camp {TEXT:Aid-de-Camp} to Her Majesty
. JUSTICE-1739-2,43.676

I was very agreeably entertain'd : JUSTICE-1739-2,43.677

Sometimes I went a visiting ; JUSTICE-1739-2,43.678

and , in the Evening , the Major was so obliging as to have a Concert of
Musick . JUSTICE-1739-2,43.679

The Mornings we spent in seeing the Curiosities of the Place .
JUSTICE-1739-2,43.680

I had the Honour sometimes to be at Admiral <font> Gordon <$$font> 's ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,43.681

and , indeed , when I took Leave of Lady <font> Sterling <$$font> , she
again repeated her generous and kind Behaviour ; not only by shewing me
<P_44> much more Respect than was any ways due to me ; but made to that
an additional Favour of an handsome Present . JUSTICE-1739-2,44.682

I had likewise the same Regard shewn me from the Family I was with , as
from many more People of Fashion in that Place . JUSTICE-1739-2,44.683

On the 12th of <font> August <$$font> , 1737 , I went on Board the Ship
, call'd the <font> Sarah <$$font> and <font> Margaret <$$font> ,
Captain Panton the Commander . JUSTICE-1739-2,44.684

We sailed out of <font> Crownstead-Mould <$$font> with a fair Wind ;
JUSTICE-1739-2,44.685

but it continu'd only Four Hours ; JUSTICE-1739-2,44.686

and we were a Fortnight in the Gulph of <font> Finland <$$font> ,
beating about with contrary Winds ; so that we got little in our Way .
JUSTICE-1739-2,44.687

I must confess , in my Return , <font> Neptune <$$font> let me see ,
that he could be as boisterous , as I had seen him calm .
JUSTICE-1739-2,44.688

I spent my Time in Reading and Working , when the Weather would permit
me ; JUSTICE-1739-2,44.689

but that was seldom . JUSTICE-1739-2,44.690

The Captain was a Gentleman of singular good Temper .
JUSTICE-1739-2,44.691

It was a very good Ship . JUSTICE-1739-2,44.692

The Accommodations were the same : JUSTICE-1739-2,44.693

But we wanted gentle Breezes . JUSTICE-1739-2,44.694

We were a Month in our Passage to <font> Elsineur : <$$font>
JUSTICE-1739-2,44.695

There we went on Shoar ; JUSTICE-1739-2,44.696

and , as soon as I landed , no less than Five Soldiers were commanded to
attend me to the House where I was going ; JUSTICE-1739-2,44.697

and there stay'd with me 'till the Captain had been with the Consul ; at
whose Return the Soldiers march'd off . JUSTICE-1739-2,44.698

This is done to prevent any one passing , without giving an Account of
themselves ; it <P_45> being thought that the Fires of <font> Russia
<$$font> have been set on Foot by some Strollers coming into that
Country . JUSTICE-1739-2,45.699

We dined here , JUSTICE-1739-2,45.700

and went on Board at Three . JUSTICE-1739-2,45.701

We weigh'd Anchor , JUSTICE-1739-2,45.702

and in about a Week's Time arrived in <font> Yarmouth <$$font> Road ,
where we were Wind-bound . JUSTICE-1739-2,45.704

We went on Shoar , JUSTICE-1739-2,45.705

and dined with the Captain's Lady ; who was so obliging , as to shew me
the Town . JUSTICE-1739-2,45.706

I return'd to the Ship ; JUSTICE-1739-2,45.707

but , thro' the Inclemency of the Weather , was , with others , obliged
to wait Three Days for a prosperous Wind . JUSTICE-1739-2,45.708

We had Three Ladies as Passengers . JUSTICE-1739-2,45.709

I thought myself quite happy ; JUSTICE-1739-2,45.710

but it did not prove so : JUSTICE-1739-2,45.711

For they were so much fright'ned , that I was uneasier than when I was
without their Company . JUSTICE-1739-2,45.712

I must confess , it was not without Reason : JUSTICE-1739-2,45.713

For we had most violent Storms of Thunder , Rain , and Wind .
JUSTICE-1739-2,45.714

I never heard any Command , but <font> Hard_a_Lee ! <$$font> and <font>
Hard_a_Weather ! <$$font> JUSTICE-1739-2,45.715

Our Mizen Stay-Sail was tore in Pieces , and other of our Sails damaged
. JUSTICE-1739-2,45.716

We were a Fortnight on our Passage from <font> Yarmouth <$$font> to
London . JUSTICE-1739-2,45.717

In all , I was at Sea for the Space of Seven Weeks , and Three Days .
