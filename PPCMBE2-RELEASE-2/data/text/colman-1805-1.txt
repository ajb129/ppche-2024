Act II . COLMAN-1805-1,19.5

Scene I . COLMAN-1805-1,19.6

<$$heading>

<font> A Library in the House of Sir <$$font> Simon Rochdale ;
COLMAN-1805-1,19.8

<font> Books scatter'd on a Writing-table . <$$font> COLMAN-1805-1,19.9

<font> Enter <$$font> Tom Shuffleton , <font> and a Servant . <$$font>
COLMAN-1805-1,19.10

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Nobody up yet ? COLMAN-1805-1,19.11

I thought so . COLMAN-1805-1,19.12

<font> Enter <$$font> Servant . COLMAN-1805-1,19.13

Ah , John , is it you ? COLMAN-1805-1,19.14

How d'@ @ye do , John ? COLMAN-1805-1,19.15

<font> John . <$$font> Thank your honour , I - COLMAN-1805-1,19.16

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Yes , you look so . COLMAN-1805-1,19.17

Sir Simon Rochdale in bed ? COLMAN-1805-1,19.18

Mr. Rochdale not risen ? COLMAN-1805-1,19.19

Well ! no matter : COLMAN-1805-1,19.20

I have travell'd all night , though , to be with them .
COLMAN-1805-1,19.21

How are they ? COLMAN-1805-1,19.22

<font> John . <$$font> Sir , they are both - COLMAN-1805-1,19.23

<font> Shuff. <$$font> I@ @'m glad to hear it . COLMAN-1805-1,19.24

Pay the post-boy for me . COLMAN-1805-1,19.25

<font> John . <$$font> Yes , sir . COLMAN-1805-1,19.26

I beg pardon , sir ; COLMAN-1805-1,19.27

but when your honour last left us - COLMAN-1805-1,19.28

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Owed you three pound five . COLMAN-1805-1,19.29

I remember : COLMAN-1805-1,19.30

have you down in my memorandums - COLMAN-1805-1,19.31

Honourable Tom Shuffleton debtor to - COLMAN-1805-1,19.32

- What@ @'s your name ? COLMAN-1805-1,19.33

<font> John . <$$font> My Christian name , sir , is - <font> Shuff.
<$$font> Muggins - COLMAN-1805-1,19.34

I recollect . COLMAN-1805-1,19.35

Pay the post-boy , Muggins . COLMAN-1805-1,19.36

And , hark ye , take particular care of the chaise : COLMAN-1805-1,19.37

I borrow'd it of my friend , Bobby Fungus , who sprang up a peer , in
the last bundle <P_20> of Barons : COLMAN-1805-1,20.38

if a single knob is knock'd out of his new coronets , he@ @'ll make me a
sharper speech than ever he@ @'ll produce in Parliament .
COLMAN-1805-1,20.39

And , John ! - COLMAN-1805-1,20.40

<font> John . <$$font> Sir . COLMAN-1805-1,20.41

<font> Shuff. <$$font> What was I going to say ? COLMAN-1805-1,20.42

<font> John . <$$font> Indeed , sir , I ca@ @n't tell .
COLMAN-1805-1,20.43

<font> Shuff. <$$font> No more can I . COLMAN-1805-1,20.44

'T@ @is the fashion to be absent - COLMAN-1805-1,20.45

that@ @'s why I forgot your little bill . COLMAN-1805-1,20.46

There , run along . COLMAN-1805-1,20.47

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> John . {COM:missing_close_bracket}
COLMAN-1805-1,20.48

I@ @'ve the whirl of Bobby's chaise in my head still .
COLMAN-1805-1,20.49

Cursed fatiguing , posting all night , through Cornish roads , to obey
the summons of friendship ! COLMAN-1805-1,20.50

Convenient , in some respects , for all that . COLMAN-1805-1,20.51

If all loungers of slender revenues , like mine , could command a
constant succession of invitations , from men of estates , in the
country , how amazingly it would tend to the thinning of Bond-street !
COLMAN-1805-1,20.52

<paren> <font> throws himself into a chair , near the writing-table .
<$$font> <$$paren> COLMAN-1805-1,20.53

Let me see - what has Sir Simon been reading ? COLMAN-1805-1,20.54

- " Burn's Justice " - COLMAN-1805-1,20.55

true ; the old man@ @'s reckon'd the ablest magistrate in the county :
COLMAN-1805-1,20.56

he has@ @n't cut open the leaves , I see . COLMAN-1805-1,20.57

" Chesterfield's Letters " - COLMAN-1805-1,20.58

pooh ! his system of education is extinct : COLMAN-1805-1,20.59

Belcher and the Butcher have superseded it . COLMAN-1805-1,20.60

" Clarendon's History of - . " COLMAN-1805-1,20.61

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Simon Rochdale . COLMAN-1805-1,20.62

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Ah , my dear Tom Shuffleton !
COLMAN-1805-1,20.63

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Baronet ! how are you ? COLMAN-1805-1,20.64

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Such expedition is kind , now !
COLMAN-1805-1,20.65

You got my letter at Bath , COLMAN-1805-1,20.66

and - <font> Shuff. <$$font> Saw it was pressing : COLMAN-1805-1,20.67

- here I am . COLMAN-1805-1,20.68

Cut all my engagements for you , COLMAN-1805-1,20.69

and came off like a shot . COLMAN-1805-1,20.70

<font> Sir Simon <$$font> Thank you : COLMAN-1805-1,20.71

thank you , heartily ! COLMAN-1805-1,20.72

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Left every thing at sixes and sevens .
COLMAN-1805-1,20.73

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Gad , I@ @'m sorry if - COLMAN-1805-1,20.74

<P_21>

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Do@ @n't apologize ; COLMAN-1805-1,21.76

- nobody does , now . COLMAN-1805-1,21.77

Left all my bills , in the place , unpaid . COLMAN-1805-1,21.78

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Bless me ! COLMAN-1805-1,21.79

I@ @'ve made it monstrous inconvenient ! COLMAN-1805-1,21.80

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Not a bit - COLMAN-1805-1,21.81

I give you my honour , COLMAN-1805-1,21.82

I did@ @n't find it inconvenient , at all . COLMAN-1805-1,21.83

How is Frank Rochdale ? COLMAN-1805-1,21.84

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Why , my son is@ @n't up yet ;
COLMAN-1805-1,21.85

and , before he@ @'s stirring , do let me talk to you , my dear Tom
Shuffleton ! COLMAN-1805-1,21.86

I have something near my heart , that - COLMAN-1805-1,21.87

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Do@ @n't talk about your heart , Baronet ;
COLMAN-1805-1,21.88

- feeling@ @'s quite out of fashion . COLMAN-1805-1,21.89

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Well , then , I@ @'m interested in -
COLMAN-1805-1,21.90

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Aye , stick to that . COLMAN-1805-1,21.91

We make a joke of the heart , now-a-days ; COLMAN-1805-1,21.92

but when a man mentions his interest , we know he@ @'s in earnest .
COLMAN-1805-1,21.93

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Zounds ! COLMAN-1805-1,21.94

I <font> am <$$font> in earnest . COLMAN-1805-1,21.95

Let me speak , COLMAN-1805-1,21.96

and call my motives what you will . COLMAN-1805-1,21.97

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Speak - COLMAN-1805-1,21.98

but do@ @n't be in a passion . COLMAN-1805-1,21.99

We are always cool at the clubs : COLMAN-1805-1,21.100

the constant habit of ruining one another , teaches us temper .
COLMAN-1805-1,21.101

Explain . COLMAN-1805-1,21.102

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Well , I will . COLMAN-1805-1,21.103

You know , my dear Tom , how much I admire your proficiency in the
<font> New School <$$font> of breeding ; COLMAN-1805-1,21.104

- you are , what I call , one of the highest finish'd fellows , of the
<font> present day . <$$font> COLMAN-1805-1,21.105

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Psha ! Baronet ; you flatter .
COLMAN-1805-1,21.106

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> No , I do@ @n't ; COLMAN-1805-1,21.107

only in extolling the merits of the newest-fashion'd manners and morals
, I am sometimes puzzled , by the plain gentlemen , who listen to me ,
here in the country , most consumedly . COLMAN-1805-1,21.108

<font> Shuff. <$$font> I do@ @n't doubt it . COLMAN-1805-1,21.109

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Why , 't@ @was but t'other morning , I was
haranguing old Sir Noah Starchington , in my library , and explaining to
him the shining qualities <P_22> of a dasher , of the year
eighteen_hundred_and_three ; COLMAN-1805-1,22.110

and what do you think he did ? COLMAN-1805-1,22.111

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Fell asleep . COLMAN-1805-1,22.112

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> No ; COLMAN-1805-1,22.113

he pull'd down an English dictionary ; when <paren> if you@ @'ll believe
me ! <$$paren> he found my definition of stylish living , under the
word " insolvency ; " COLMAN-1805-1,22.114

a fighting crop turn'd out a " dock'd bull-dog ; " and modern gallantry
, " adultery and seduction . " COLMAN-1805-1,22.115

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Noah Starchington is a damn'd old twaddler .
COLMAN-1805-1,22.116

- But the fact is , Baronet , we improve . COLMAN-1805-1,22.117

We have voted many qualities to be virtues , now , that they never
thought of calling virtues formerly . COLMAN-1805-1,22.118

The rising generation wants a new dictionary , damnably .
COLMAN-1805-1,22.119

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Deplorably indeed . COLMAN-1805-1,22.120

You ca@ @n't think , my dear Tom , what a scurvy figure you , and the
dashing fellows of your kidney , make in the old ones .
COLMAN-1805-1,22.121

- But you have great influence over my son , Frank ;
COLMAN-1805-1,22.122

and I want you to exert it . COLMAN-1805-1,22.123

You are his intimate - COLMAN-1805-1,22.124

you come here , COLMAN-1805-1,22.125

and pass two or three months at a time , you know .
COLMAN-1805-1,22.126

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Yes - this is a pleasant house .
COLMAN-1805-1,22.127

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> You ride his horses , as if they were your
own . COLMAN-1805-1,22.128

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Yes - he keeps a good stable .
COLMAN-1805-1,22.129

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> You drink our claret with him , till his
head aches . COLMAN-1805-1,22.130

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Yours is a famous claret , Baronet .
COLMAN-1805-1,22.131

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> You worm out his secrets ;
COLMAN-1805-1,22.132

you win his money ; COLMAN-1805-1,22.133

you - . In short , you are - <font> Shuff. <$$font> His friend ,
according to the next new dictionary . COLMAN-1805-1,22.134

That@ @'s what you mean , Sir Simon . COLMAN-1805-1,22.135

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Exactly . COLMAN-1805-1,22.136

- But , let me explain . COLMAN-1805-1,22.137

Frank , if he does@ @n't play the fool , and spoil all , is going to be
married . COLMAN-1805-1,22.138

<font> Shuff. <$$font> To how much ? COLMAN-1805-1,22.139

<P_23>

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Damn it , COLMAN-1805-1,23.141

now , how like a modern man of the world that is ! COLMAN-1805-1,23.142

Formerly , they would have ask'd to <font> who <$$font> .
COLMAN-1805-1,23.143

<font> Shuff. <$$font> We never do , now ; COLMAN-1805-1,23.144

- fortune@ @'s every thing . COLMAN-1805-1,23.145

We say " a good match , " at the west end of the town , as they say " a
good man , " in the city ; COLMAN-1805-1,23.146

- the phrase refers merely to money . COLMAN-1805-1,23.147

Is she rich ? COLMAN-1805-1,23.148

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Four_thousand a year .
COLMAN-1805-1,23.149

<font> Shuff. <$$font> What a devilish desirable woman !
COLMAN-1805-1,23.150

Frank@ @'s a happy dog ! COLMAN-1805-1,23.151

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> He@ @'s a miserable puppy .
COLMAN-1805-1,23.152

He has no more notion , my dear Tom , of a modern " good match , " than
Eve had of pin-money . COLMAN-1805-1,23.153

<font> Shuff. <$$font> What are his objections to it ?
COLMAN-1805-1,23.154

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> I have smoked 'im ; COLMAN-1805-1,23.155

but he does@ @n't know that ; COLMAN-1805-1,23.156

- a filly , sly amour , in another quarter . COLMAN-1805-1,23.157

<font> Shuff. <$$font> An amour ! COLMAN-1805-1,23.158

That@ @'s a very unfashionable reason for declining matrimony .
COLMAN-1805-1,23.159

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> You know his romantick flights .
COLMAN-1805-1,23.160

The blockhead , I believe , is so attach'd , I shou'd@ @n't wonder if he
flew off at a tangent , and married the girl that has bewitch'd him .
COLMAN-1805-1,23.161

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Who is she ? COLMAN-1805-1,23.162

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> She - hem ! - she lives with her father ,
in Penzance . COLMAN-1805-1,23.163

<font> Shuff. <$$font> And who is <font> he <$$font> ?
COLMAN-1805-1,23.164

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> He - upon my soul , I am ashamed to tell
you . COLMAN-1805-1,23.165

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Do@ @n't be asham'd ; COLMAN-1805-1,23.166

we never blush at any thing , in the New School . COLMAN-1805-1,23.167

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Damn me , my dear Tom , if he is@ @n't a
brazier . COLMAN-1805-1,23.168

<font> Shuff. <$$font> The devil ! COLMAN-1805-1,23.169

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> A dealer in kitchen candlesticks , coal
skuttles , coppers , and cauldrons . COLMAN-1805-1,23.170

<font> Shuff. <$$font> And is the girl pretty ? COLMAN-1805-1,23.171

<P_24>

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> So they tell me ; - a plump little devil ,
as round as a tea kettle . COLMAN-1805-1,24.173

<font> Shuff. <$$font> I@ @'ll be after the brazier's daughter ,
to-morrow . COLMAN-1805-1,24.174

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> But you have weight with him .
COLMAN-1805-1,24.175

Talk to him , my dear Tom - COLMAN-1805-1,24.176

reason with him ; COLMAN-1805-1,24.177

try your powers , Tom , COLMAN-1805-1,24.178

do ! COLMAN-1805-1,24.179

<font> Shuff. <$$font> I do@ @n't much like plotting with the father
against the son - COLMAN-1805-1,24.180

that@ @'s reversing the New School , Baronet . COLMAN-1805-1,24.181

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> But it will serve Frank :
COLMAN-1805-1,24.182

it will serve <font> me <$$font> , who wish to serve <font> you .
COLMAN-1805-1,24.183

<font> And to prove that I do wish it , I have been keeping something in
embryo for you , my dear Tom Shuffleton , against your arrival .
COLMAN-1805-1,24.184

<font> Shuff. <$$font> For me ? COLMAN-1805-1,24.185

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> When you were last leaving us , if you
recollect , you mention'd , in a kind of a way , a - a sort of intention
of a loan , of an odd five_hundred pounds . COLMAN-1805-1,24.186

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Did I ? COLMAN-1805-1,24.187

I believe I might . COLMAN-1805-1,24.188

- When I intend to raise money , I always give my friends the preference
. COLMAN-1805-1,24.189

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> I told you I was out of cash , then , I
remember . COLMAN-1805-1,24.190

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Yes ; that@ @'s just what I told you , I
remember . COLMAN-1805-1,24.191

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> I have the sum floating by me , now ,
COLMAN-1805-1,24.192

and much at your service <paren> <font> presenting it <$$font> <$$paren>
. COLMAN-1805-1,24.193

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Why , as it@ @'s lying idle , Baronet , I - I -
do@ @n't much care if I employ it <paren> <font> taking it <$$font>
<$$paren> . COLMAN-1805-1,24.194

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Use your interest with Frank , now .
COLMAN-1805-1,24.195

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Rely on me . COLMAN-1805-1,24.196

- Shall I give you my note ? COLMAN-1805-1,24.197

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> No , my dear Tom ; that@ @'s an unnecessary
trouble . COLMAN-1805-1,24.198

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Why , that@ @'s true - with one who knows me so
well as you . COLMAN-1805-1,24.199

<P_25>

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Your verbal promise to pay , is quite as
good . COLMAN-1805-1,25.201

<font> Shuff. <$$font> I@ @'ll see if Frank@ @'s stirring . <paren>

Eh ? COLMAN-1805-1,25.205

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Pray , do you employ the phrase , " verbal
promise to pay , " according to the reading of old dictionaries , or as
it@ @'s the fashion to use it at present . COLMAN-1805-1,25.206

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Oh , damn it , COLMAN-1805-1,25.207

By according to this match , in obedience to my father , I leave to all

Rigid morality , after all , is the best coat of mail for the conscience
. COLMAN-1805-1,33.466

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Our ancestors , who wore mail , admired it
amazingly ; COLMAN-1805-1,33.467

but to mix in the gay world , with their rigid morality , would be as
singular as stalking into a drawing_room , in their armour ;
COLMAN-1805-1,33.468

- for dissipation is , now , the fashionable habit , with which , like a
brown coat , a man goes into company , to avoid being stared at .

Reason bid me love my child , and help my friend : COLMAN-1805-1,33.481

- what@ @'s the consequence ? COLMAN-1805-1,33.482

my friend has run one way , and broke up my trade ; -

my daughter has run another , and broke my - . COLMAN-1805-1,34.485

COLMAN-1805-1,34.487

<font> Bur . <$$font> Well , but , master - COLMAN-1805-1,34.488

<font> Job . <$$font> And reason told me to take you into my shop ,
when the fat churchwardens starved you at the workhouse ,
COLMAN-1805-1,34.489

- damn their want of feeling for it ! COLMAN-1805-1,34.490

- and you were thump'd about , a poor , unoffending , ragged-rump'd boy

<font> Bur . <$$font> That@ @'s the first real unkind word you ever

<font> Job . <$$font> The bailiffs are below , clearing the goods :

COLMAN-1805-1,34.503

I began upon a little ; COLMAN-1805-1,34.504

I made that little great , by industry ; COLMAN-1805-1,34.505

I never cringed to a customer , to get him into my books , that I might
hamper him with an overcharged bill , for long credit ;
COLMAN-1805-1,34.506

I earn'd my fair profits ; COLMAN-1805-1,34.507

I paid my fair way ; COLMAN-1805-1,34.508

I break by the treachery of a friend , COLMAN-1805-1,34.509

and my first dividend will be seventeen shillings in the pound .
COLMAN-1805-1,34.510

I wish every tradesman in England may clap his hand on his heart , and

<font> Pereg. <$$font> You may remember , too , when the boy had
finish'd his tale of distress , you put ten guineas in his hand .
COLMAN-1805-1,38.641

They were the first earnings of your trade , you told him ,
COLMAN-1805-1,38.642

and could not be laid out to better advantage than in relieving a

- and , giving him a letter of recommendation to a sea captain at
Falmouth , you wish'd him good spirits , and prosperity .
COLMAN-1805-1,38.644

He left you with a promise , that , if fortune ever smiled upon him ,

From a romantick folly , the growth of boyish brains , I had fix'd my

Chance , at length , raised me a friend in India ; by whose interest ,

Calcutta . COLMAN-1805-1,39.677

<font> Job . <$$font> And have just landed it , I suppose , in England

COLMAN-1805-1,40.679

As for the rest of my property - bills , bonds , cash , jewels - the

And what@ @'s in it ? COLMAN-1805-1,40.689

<font> Pereg. <$$font> The harvest of a kind man's charity ; - the
produce of your bounty , to one whom you thought an orphan .
COLMAN-1805-1,40.690

I have traded , these twenty years , on ten guineas <paren> which , from
the first , I had set apart as yours <$$paren> , till they have become
ten_thousand : COLMAN-1805-1,40.691

take it ; COLMAN-1805-1,40.692

it could not , I find , come more opportunely . COLMAN-1805-1,40.693

Your honest heart gratified itself in administering to my need ;
COLMAN-1805-1,40.694

and I experience that burst of pleasure , a grateful man enjoys , in
relieving my reliever <paren> <font> giving him the box <$$font>

<font> Job . <$$font> I@ @'ll tell you , as soon as I@ @'m able .
COLMAN-1805-1,40.700

T'other day , I lent a friend - COLMAN-1805-1,40.701

Pshaw , rot it ! COLMAN-1805-1,40.702

I@ @'m an old fool ! <paren> <font> wiping his eyes . <$$font>

He walk'd off with them , COLMAN-1805-1,40.705

and made me a bankrupt . COLMAN-1805-1,40.706

Do@ @n't you think he is a rascal ? COLMAN-1805-1,40.707

<P_41>

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Decidedly so . COLMAN-1805-1,41.709

<font> Job . <$$font> And what should I be , if I took all you have
saved in the world , and left you to shift for yourself ?
COLMAN-1805-1,41.710

<font> Pereg. <$$font> But the case is different .
COLMAN-1805-1,41.711

This money is , in fact , your own . COLMAN-1805-1,41.712

I am inured to hardships ; better able to bear them ,
COLMAN-1805-1,41.713

and am younger than you . COLMAN-1805-1,41.714

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Remember , too , you have claims upon you ,
which I have not . COLMAN-1805-1,41.719

My guide , as I came hither , said , you had married in my absence :
COLMAN-1805-1,41.720

't@ @is true , he told me , you were , now , a widower ;
COLMAN-1805-1,41.721

but , it seems , you have a daughter to provide for .
COLMAN-1805-1,41.722

<font> Job . <$$font> I have no daughter to provide for , now !
COLMAN-1805-1,41.723

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Then , he misinform'd me . COLMAN-1805-1,41.724

<font> Job . <$$font> No , he did@ @n't . COLMAN-1805-1,41.725

I had one , last night ; COLMAN-1805-1,41.726

but she@ @'s gone . COLMAN-1805-1,41.727

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Gone ! COLMAN-1805-1,41.728

<font> Job . <$$font> Yes ; gone to sea , for what I know , as you did
. COLMAN-1805-1,41.729

Run away from a good father , as you did . COLMAN-1805-1,41.730

This is a morning to remember ; COLMAN-1805-1,41.731

- my daughter has run out , COLMAN-1805-1,41.732

and the bailiffs have run in ; COLMAN-1805-1,41.733

- I sha'@ @n't soon forget the day of the month . COLMAN-1805-1,41.734

<font> Pereg. <$$font> This morning , did you say ?
COLMAN-1805-1,41.735

<font> Job . <$$font> Aye , before day-break ; - a hard-hearted , base

<font> Pereg. <$$font> And could she leave you , during the derangement
of your affairs ? COLMAN-1805-1,41.737

<font> Job . <$$font> She did@ @n't know what was going to happen ,
poor soul ! COLMAN-1805-1,41.738

let 'em take 'em - COLMAN-1805-1,41.746

<P_42>

damn the gridirons and warming-pans ! COLMAN-1805-1,42.748

I could begin again - COLMAN-1805-1,42.749

COLMAN-1805-1,42.750

but I shall hit upon something . COLMAN-1805-1,42.751

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Let me make a proposal to you , my old friend .
COLMAN-1805-1,42.752

Permit me to settle with the officers , and to clear all demands upon
you . COLMAN-1805-1,42.753

Make it a debt , if you please . I will have a hold , if it must be so
, on your future profits in trade ; COLMAN-1805-1,42.754

- but do this , and I promise to restore your daughter to you .
COLMAN-1805-1,42.755

<font> Job . <$$font> What ? bring back my child !
COLMAN-1805-1,42.756

Do you know where she is ? COLMAN-1805-1,42.757

Is she safe ? COLMAN-1805-1,42.758

Is she far off ? COLMAN-1805-1,42.759

COLMAN-1805-1,42.761

<font> Job . <$$font> Yes , yes ; on those terms - on those conditions
. COLMAN-1805-1,42.762

But , where is Mary ? COLMAN-1805-1,42.763

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Patience . COLMAN-1805-1,42.764

I must not tell you yet ; COLMAN-1805-1,42.765

but , in four-and-twenty hours , I pledge myself to bring her back to
you . COLMAN-1805-1,42.766

<font> Job . <$$font> What , here ? to her father's house ?
COLMAN-1805-1,42.767

Oh , 'sbud ! when I see her safe , what a thundering passion I@ @'ll be

But you are not deceiving me ? COLMAN-1805-1,42.770

You know , the first time you came into my shop , what a bouncer you
told me , when you were a boy . COLMAN-1805-1,42.771

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Believe me , I would not trifle with you , now .
COLMAN-1805-1,42.772

Come , come down to your shop , that we may rid it of its present
visitants . COLMAN-1805-1,42.773

<font> Job . <$$font> I believe you dropt from the clouds , all on a

COLMAN-1805-1,42.774

<font> Pereg. <$$font> I rejoice , my honest friend , that I arrived at
so critical a juncture ; COLMAN-1805-1,42.775

<font> Sir <$$font> Simon Rochdale's <font> Library . <$$font>
COLMAN-1805-1,43.786

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Simon Rochdale , <font> and the Earl of
<$$font> Fitz Balaam . COLMAN-1805-1,43.787

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Believe me , my Lord , the man I wish'd
most to meet in my library this morning , was the Earl of Fitz Balaam .
COLMAN-1805-1,43.788

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> Thank you , Sir Simon .
COLMAN-1805-1,43.789

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Your arrival , a day before your promise ,
gives us such convenient leisure to talk over the arrangements ,
relative to the marriage of Lady Caroline Braymore , your lordship's
daughter , with my son . COLMAN-1805-1,43.790

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> True , Sir Simon . COLMAN-1805-1,43.791

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Then , while Lady Caroline is at her toilet
, we@ @'ll dash into business at once ; COLMAN-1805-1,43.792

for I know your lordship is a man of few words . COLMAN-1805-1,43.793

They tell me , my lord , you have sat in the Upper House , and said
nothing but aye and no , there , for these thirty years .
COLMAN-1805-1,43.794

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> I spoke , for more than a minute , in the
year of the Influenza . COLMAN-1805-1,43.795

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Bless me ! the epidemic , perhaps , raging
among the members , at the moment . COLMAN-1805-1,43.796

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> Yes ; COLMAN-1805-1,43.797

- they cough'd so loud , I left off in the middle .
COLMAN-1805-1,43.798

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> And you never attempted again ?
COLMAN-1805-1,43.799

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> I hate to talk much , Sir Simon ;
COLMAN-1805-1,43.800

- 't@ @is my way ; tho' several do@ @n't like it . COLMAN-1805-1,43.801

<P_44>

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> I do . COLMAN-1805-1,44.803

I consider it as a mark of your lordship's discretion .
COLMAN-1805-1,44.804

The less you say , my lord , in my mind , the wiser you are ;
COLMAN-1805-1,44.805

and I have often thought it a pity , that some noble orators hav'@ @n't
follow'd your lordship's example . COLMAN-1805-1,44.806

- But , here are the writings <paren> <font> sitting down with Lord
<$$font> Fitz Balaam , <font> and taking them from the table <$$font>
<$$paren> . COLMAN-1805-1,44.807

We must wave ceremony now , my lord ; COLMAN-1805-1,44.808

for all this pile of parchment is built on the independent four_thousand
a year of your daughter , Lady Caroline , on one hand , and your
lordship's incumbrances , on the other . COLMAN-1805-1,44.809

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> I have saddles on my property , Sir Simon .
<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Which saddles , your lordship's property
being uncommonly small , look something like sixteen stone upon a poney
. COLMAN-1805-1,44.810

The Fitz Balaam estate , for an earl , is deplorably narrow !
COLMAN-1805-1,44.811

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> Yet , it has given security for a large
debt . COLMAN-1805-1,44.812

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Large , indeed ! COLMAN-1805-1,44.813

I ca@ @n't think how you have contriv'd it . COLMAN-1805-1,44.814

'T@ @is the Archbishop of Brobdignag , squeez'd into Tom Thumb's
pantaloons . COLMAN-1805-1,44.815

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> Mine is the oldest estate in England , Sir
Simon . COLMAN-1805-1,44.816

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> If we may judge of age by decay , my lord ,
it must be very ancient , indeed ! COLMAN-1805-1,44.817

- But this goes to something in the shape of supplies <paren> <font>
untying the papers <$$font> <$$paren> : COLMAN-1805-1,44.818

" Covenant between Augustus Julius Braymore , Earl of Fitz Balaam , of
Cullender Castle , in the county of Cumberland , and Simon Rochdale ,
baronet , of Hollyhock-house , in the county of Cornwall . "
COLMAN-1805-1,44.819

- By the bye , my lord , considering what an expence attends that castle
, which is at your own disposal , and that , if the auctioneer do@ @n't
soon knock it <P_45> down , the weather will , I wonder what has
prevented your lordship's bringing it to the hammer .
COLMAN-1805-1,45.820

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> The dignity of my ancestors .
COLMAN-1805-1,45.821

I have blood in my family , Sir Simon <paren> <font> proudly <$$font>
<$$paren> . COLMAN-1805-1,45.822

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> A deal of excellent blood , my lord ;
COLMAN-1805-1,45.823

but , from the butler down to the house-dog , curse me if ever I saw so
little flesh in a family before . COLMAN-1805-1,45.824

- But , by this covenant - <font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> You clear off
the largest mortgage . COLMAN-1805-1,45.825

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Right ; - for which purpose , on the day of
the young folks' marriage - <font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> You must pay me
forty_thousand pounds . COLMAN-1805-1,45.826

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Right , again . COLMAN-1805-1,45.827

Your lordship says little ; COLMAN-1805-1,45.828

but 't@ @is terribly plump to the point , indeed , my lord .
COLMAN-1805-1,45.829

Here is the covenant ; COLMAN-1805-1,45.830

- and , now , will your lordship look over the marriage articles ?
COLMAN-1805-1,45.831

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> My attorney will be here to-morrow , Sir
Simon . COLMAN-1805-1,45.832

I prefer reading by deputy COLMAN-1805-1,45.833

<paren> <font> both rise <$$font> <$$paren> . COLMAN-1805-1,45.834

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Many people of rank read in the same way ,
my lord . COLMAN-1805-1,45.835

And your lordship will receive the forty_thousand pounds , I am to pay
you , by deputy also , I suppose . COLMAN-1805-1,45.836

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> I seldom swear , Sir Simon ;
COLMAN-1805-1,45.837

but , damn me if I will . COLMAN-1805-1,45.838

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> I believe you are right .
COLMAN-1805-1,45.839

Yet there are but two reasons for not trusting an attorney with your
money : COLMAN-1805-1,45.840

- one is , when you do@ @n't know him very well ; COLMAN-1805-1,45.841

and the other is , when you do . COLMAN-1805-1,45.842

- And now , since the marriage is concluded , as I may say , in the
families , may I take the liberty to ask , my lord , what sort of a wife
my son Frank may expect in Lady Caroline ? COLMAN-1805-1,45.843

Frank is rather of a grave , domestick turn : COLMAN-1805-1,45.844

Lady Caroline , it seems , has past the three last winters in London .
COLMAN-1805-1,45.845

Did her ladyship enter into <font> all <$$font> the spirit of the first
circles ? COLMAN-1805-1,45.846

<P_46>

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> She was as gay as a lark , Sir Simon .
COLMAN-1805-1,46.848

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Was she like the lark in her hours , my
lord ? COLMAN-1805-1,46.849

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> A great deal more like the owl , Sir Simon
. COLMAN-1805-1,46.850

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> I thought so . COLMAN-1805-1,46.851

Frank's mornings in London , will begin where her ladyship's nights
finish . COLMAN-1805-1,46.852

But his case wo@ @n't be very singular . COLMAN-1805-1,46.853

Many couples make the marriage bed a kind of cold matrimonial well ;
COLMAN-1805-1,46.854

and the two family buckets dip into it alternately .
COLMAN-1805-1,46.855

<font> Enter <$$font> Lady Caroline Braymore . COLMAN-1805-1,46.856

<font> Lady Car. <$$font> Do I interrupt business ?
COLMAN-1805-1,46.857

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Not in the least . COLMAN-1805-1,46.858

Pray , Lady Caroline , come in . COLMAN-1805-1,46.859

His Lordship and I have just concluded . COLMAN-1805-1,46.860

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> And I must go and walk my three miles ,
this morning . COLMAN-1805-1,46.861

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> Must you , my lord ? COLMAN-1805-1,46.862

<font> Lord Fitz . <$$font> My physician prescribed it , when I told
him I was apt to be dull , after dinner . COLMAN-1805-1,46.863

<font> Sir Simon . <$$font> I would attend your lordship ;
COLMAN-1805-1,46.864

- but since Lady Caroline favours me with - - COLMAN-1805-1,46.865

<font> Lady Car. <$$font> No , no , - do@ @n't mind me .
COLMAN-1805-1,46.866

I assure you , I had much rather you would go . COLMAN-1805-1,46.867

- hum ! - but the petticoats have their new school of good breeding ,

COLMAN-1805-1,46.869

Well , we are gone - COLMAN-1805-1,46.870

basis of my son's happiness : - though his lordship is@ @n't much
inclined to read . COLMAN-1805-1,46.871

<font> Lady Car. <$$font> But I am . COLMAN-1805-1,46.872
