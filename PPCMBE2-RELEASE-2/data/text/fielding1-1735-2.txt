Act II . FIELDING1-1735-2,15.4

Scene I . FIELDING1-1735-2,15.5

<$$heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> Simon <font> 's House <$$font> .
FIELDING1-1735-2,15.7

<font> Enter Lady <$$font> Raffler , <font> and Mrs. <$$font> Raffler .
FIELDING1-1735-2,15.8

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Never tell me , Sister , it is notorious
that a Woman of my Virtue and Discretion , and Prudence , shou'd be
eternally tormented with the Suspicions of a jealous-pated Husband .
FIELDING1-1735-2,15.9

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I own it , FIELDING1-1735-2,15.10

but I only propose to you the best Method to quiet them .
FIELDING1-1735-2,15.11

You can@ @not alter his Nature , FIELDING1-1735-2,15.12

and if you wou'd condescend to flatter it a little , you wou'd make your
Life much easier . FIELDING1-1735-2,15.13

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> I flatter it ! FIELDING1-1735-2,15.14

I assure you , I sha@ @n't . FIELDING1-1735-2,15.15

If my Virtue be not clear enough of it_self , I shall use no Art to make
it so - FIELDING1-1735-2,15.16

must I give a Husband an Account of all my Words and Actions ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,15.17

must I satisfy his groundless Fears ? FIELDING1-1735-2,15.18

I am no such poor_spirited Wretch ; FIELDING1-1735-2,15.19

and I solemnly declare , if I knew any one <P_16> thing that wou'd make
him more jealous , than another , I wou'd do it .
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.20

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Then you wou'd do wrong , my Dear and only
revenge your Husband's Jealousy on your_self . FIELDING1-1735-2,16.21

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Sister , Sister , do@ @n't preach up any of
your Maxims to me . FIELDING1-1735-2,16.22

If the Colonel was of Sir <font> Simon <$$font> 's Temper , you wou'd
lead a worse Life than I do . FIELDING1-1735-2,16.23

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Indeed , you are mistaken ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.24

if my Husband was as jealous , and as cunning as the Devil , I wou'd
engage to make an arrant Ass of him . FIELDING1-1735-2,16.25

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> You wou'd make another sort of a Beast of
him . FIELDING1-1735-2,16.26

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I do@ @n't tell you that .
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.27

But if I shou'd , he had better be so , than suspect it -
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.28

his Horns wou'd hurt him less on his Forehead than in his Eyes .
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.29

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> I wonder you can talk such stuff to me ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.30

I ca@ @n't bear to hear it , FIELDING1-1735-2,16.31

the very Name of a Whore makes me swoon ; FIELDING1-1735-2,16.32

if any Set of Words cou'd ever raise the Devil , that single one wou'd
do more than all . FIELDING1-1735-2,16.33

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Dear Sister , do@ @n't be so outrageously
virtuous . FIELDING1-1735-2,16.34

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> It wou'd be well for you , if the Colonel
had a little of Sir <font> Simon <$$font> 's Temper .
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.35

I ca@ @n't help telling you there are some Actions of your Life , which
I am far from approving . FIELDING1-1735-2,16.36

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Come , do@ @n't be censorious .
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.37

I never refuse giving my Husband an Account of any of my Actions , when
he desires it - FIELDING1-1735-2,16.38

and that is more than you can say . FIELDING1-1735-2,16.39

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> My Actions give an Account of themselves ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.40

I am not afraid of the World's looking into 'em .
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.41

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Take my Word for it , Child ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.42

pure Nature wo@ @n't do , FIELDING1-1735-2,16.43

the World will easily see your Faults , FIELDING1-1735-2,16.44

but your Virtues must be shewn artfully , FIELDING1-1735-2,16.45

or they will be discover'd . FIELDING1-1735-2,16.46

Art goes beyond Nature : FIELDING1-1735-2,16.47

and a Woman who has only Virtue in her Face , will pass much better
thro' the World , then she who has it only in her Heart .
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.48

<P_17> La. <font> Raff. <$$font> I do@ @n't know what you mean , Madam
, FIELDING1-1735-2,17.49

I am sure my Conduct has been always careful of Appearances ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.50

but as for the Suspicions of my Husband , I despise ; and neither can
nor will give my_self any Trouble about 'em . FIELDING1-1735-2,17.51

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Soh ! here he comes ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.52

and I suppose we shall have the usual Dialogue . FIELDING1-1735-2,17.53

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Simon . FIELDING1-1735-2,17.54

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Your Servant , Ladies !
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.55

Why you are at home early to Day . FIELDING1-1735-2,17.56

What , cou'd you find no Diversions in Town ? FIELDING1-1735-2,17.57

Is there no Opera-Rehearsal , no Auctions , no Mall ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.58

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> No , none : FIELDING1-1735-2,17.59

Besides , my Sister had a mind to be at home . FIELDING1-1735-2,17.60

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> You need not have said that , my Dear ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.61

I shou'd not have suspected you . FIELDING1-1735-2,17.62

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> I think , I seldom give you Reason of
suspecting my Fondness for my own House . FIELDING1-1735-2,17.63

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> No , nor of any thing else .
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.64

I am not jealous of you , my Dear . FIELDING1-1735-2,17.65

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> It wou'd give me no Uneasiness , if you was
. FIELDING1-1735-2,17.66

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> I am not jealous even of Captain <font> Spark
. <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,17.67

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Captain <font> Spark ! <$$font> who is he ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.68

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Tho' he is a very pretty Gentleman , and is
very agreeable Company . FIELDING1-1735-2,17.69

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> I long to see him mightily .
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.70

Wo@ @n't you invite him hither , my Dear ? FIELDING1-1735-2,17.71

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Why shou'd I invite him , when you can meet
him at an Auction as well ? FIELDING1-1735-2,17.72

- Besides , it seems , he is not proper Company for me ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.73

or you would not have shuffled him away yesterday , when I came .
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.74

You need not have taken such Care to hide him , FIELDING1-1735-2,17.75

I shou'd not have been jealous of him , my Dear .
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.76

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> This must be some strange Chimera of his
own : FIELDING1-1735-2,17.77

no such Person was with us . FIELDING1-1735-2,17.78

<bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,17.79

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> No , my Dear , I know you wou'd not , tho'
he is a very pretty Fellow . FIELDING1-1735-2,17.80

<P_18> Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> The Devil take all such pretty Fellows
! With all my Heart and Soul . FIELDING1-1735-2,18.81

<bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,18.82

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Do@ @n't you know , Sister , he is the most
witty , most entertaining Creature in the World ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.83

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Think whom so ? FIELDING1-1735-2,18.84

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Oh , the Captain , - Captain , - what@ @'s
his Name {TEXT:N_me} ? FIELDING1-1735-2,18.85

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Captain <font> Spark , <$$font> Madam .
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.86

I@ @'ll assist you . FIELDING1-1735-2,18.87

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ay , Captain <font> Spark . <$$font>
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.88

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I know no Captain <font> Spark , <$$font>
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.89

nor was any such Person with us yesterday . FIELDING1-1735-2,18.90

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Do@ @n't believe her , my Dear .
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.91

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> No , my Dear , I shall not ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.92

I assure you . FIELDING1-1735-2,18.93

But do you think this Right , my Dear ? FIELDING1-1735-2,18.94

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> What , Right ? FIELDING1-1735-2,18.95

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Why being particular with an idle , rakehelly
young Fellow . FIELDING1-1735-2,18.96

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Sir <font> Simon <$$font> , I shall not have
my Company prescrib'd to me by any one . FIELDING1-1735-2,18.97

I will keep what company I please , FIELDING1-1735-2,18.98

I shall answer to the World for my Actions . FIELDING1-1735-2,18.99

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Yes , Madam , I am to answer to the World for
your Actions too - FIELDING1-1735-2,18.100

I am most concern'd to see that you act right , since I must bear the
greater Part of the Shame , if you do@ @n't . FIELDING1-1735-2,18.101

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Sir , this is a Usage I ca@ @n't bear ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.102

nor I wo@ @n't bear ! FIELDING1-1735-2,18.103

trouble not me with your base , groundless Suspicions :
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.104

I believe the whole World is sensible how unworthy you are of a Woman of
my Virtue ; FIELDING1-1735-2,18.105

But , henceforth , when ever any of these Chimeras are rais'd in your
Head , I shall leave you to lay them at your Leisure .
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.106

<bracket> <$$font> Exit . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,18.107

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Is not this intolerable ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.108

Is not this insufferable ! FIELDING1-1735-2,18.109

This is the comfortable State that a Man is wish'd Joy of by his Friends
: FIELDING1-1735-2,18.110

And yet no man wishes a Man Joy of being Condemn'd or of getting the
Plague . FIELDING1-1735-2,18.111

But when a Man is marry'd , Give you Joy , Sir , cries one Fool ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.112

I wish you Joy , says another ; FIELDING1-1735-2,18.113

and thus the Wretch is usher'd into the Gallies , with the same Triumph
as he cou'd be exalted with to the Empire of the Great <font> Mogul .
<$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,18.114

<P_19> Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> You your_self make it so , Brother :
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.115

if you had less Jealousy in your Temper , or Lady <font> Raffler
<$$font> , more Complaisance , you might be very happy -
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.116

You torment your_self with groundless Fears , FIELDING1-1735-2,19.117

and she depends on her own Innocence , FIELDING1-1735-2,19.118

and will not quiet them . FIELDING1-1735-2,19.119

This was the Case just now : FIELDING1-1735-2,19.120

for whatever put this Captain <font> Spark <$$font> into your Head , I
will take my Oath , she spoke to no such Man at the Auction .
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.121

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> You are a trusty Confident , I find -
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.122

but I had it from his own Mouth . FIELDING1-1735-2,19.123

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> What had you from his own Mouth ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.124

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What ! why that my Wife was a tall Woman .
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.125

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ha , ha , ha ! a very good Reason to be
jealous indeed . FIELDING1-1735-2,19.126

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Yes , Madam , and that she was a fair Woman .
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.127

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Well , and - Ha , ha , ha !
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.128

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Look ye , Sister , if he had told me this at
first , I shou'd not have regarded it : FIELDING1-1735-2,19.129

but I pumpt it out of him . FIELDING1-1735-2,19.130

He is a very close Fellow , and proper to be trusted with a Secret , I
can tell you ; FIELDING1-1735-2,19.131

for he told me just the contrary ; FIELDING1-1735-2,19.132

but Truth will out , Sister : FIELDING1-1735-2,19.133

besides , did you not hear my Wife confess it ? FIELDING1-1735-2,19.134

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> That was only in Revenge , to plague you .
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.135

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> A very charitable good sort of Lady , truly .
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.136

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I wish she was of my Temper , Brother , and
wou'd give you Satisfaction in every thing - FIELDING1-1735-2,19.137

For my part , I own , if I was your Wife , your Jealousy would give me
no Pain , FIELDING1-1735-2,19.138

and I should take a Pleasure in quieting it : FIELDING1-1735-2,19.139

I shou'd never be uneasy at your enquiring into any of my Actions -
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.140

I shou'd rather take it for a Proof of your Love , and be the fonder of
you for it . FIELDING1-1735-2,19.141

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Yes , Madam , but I do not desire my Wife ,
shou'd be like you , neither . FIELDING1-1735-2,19.142

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Why so , Brother ? FIELDING1-1735-2,19.143

What do you dislike in me ? FIELDING1-1735-2,19.144

<P_20> Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Truly , Madam , that Rendezvous of
Fellows you continually keep at your House , and which , if your Husband
was of my Mind - Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> He wou'd be Jealous of , I
suppose . FIELDING1-1735-2,20.145

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Particularly , that tall Fellow , who
breakfasts here , dines here , sups here , and I believe lies here , or
will lie here very shortly . FIELDING1-1735-2,20.146

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Hold , Brother , FIELDING1-1735-2,20.147

I desire you wou'd not grow scurrilous ; FIELDING1-1735-2,20.148

no wonder , my Sister ca@ @n't bear with this cursed Temper of yours .
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.149

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What can a marry'd Woman mean by an Intimacy
with any other but her Husband ? FIELDING1-1735-2,20.150

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> What@ @'s that to you , Brother ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.151

who made you the Inquisitor of my Actions ? FIELDING1-1735-2,20.152

Do you think to call me to an Account , as you do your Wife ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.153

Oh ! if I was marry'd to such a jealous - If I did not give him enough
of his Jealousy in one Week , if I did not make him heartily weary on@
@'t - FIELDING1-1735-2,20.154

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Oh rare ! FIELDING1-1735-2,20.155

this is the Woman that wou'd take a Pleasure in satisfying her Husband's
Doubts . FIELDING1-1735-2,20.156

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Look ye , Sir <font> Simon <$$font> ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.157

your Temper is so intolerable , that you are the By-word of every one ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.158

the whole Town compassionates my Sister's Case , FIELDING1-1735-2,20.159

and if I was she , if a virtuous Woman cou'd not content you , you
shou'd have your Content another way - FIELDING1-1735-2,20.160

If you wou'd have an Account of every thing I did , I wou'd do something
worth giving you an Account of . FIELDING1-1735-2,20.161

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> I believe it , FIELDING1-1735-2,20.162

I easily believe it . FIELDING1-1735-2,20.163

It is very plain , who is my Wife's Counsellor - FIELDING1-1735-2,20.164

But I shall take care to get some better Advice ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.165

for I will not be a Cuckold if I can help it , Madam .
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.166

<font> Enter <$$font> Clarinda . FIELDING1-1735-2,20.167

<font> Cla. <$$font> There@ @'s my poor Lady <font> Raffler <$$font>
within in the most terrible way - FIELDING1-1735-2,20.168

She has taken a whole Bottle of Hartshorn to keep up her Spirits .
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.169

It has thrown me into the Vapours , to see her in such a Condition ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.170

and she wo@ @n't tell me what@ @'s the matter with her .
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.171

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Can you have liv'd a Fortnight in the
<P_21> House , and want to know it ? FIELDING1-1735-2,21.172

Sir <font> Simon <$$font> has abus'd her in the most barbarous manner .
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.173

You are a wicked Man . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.174

<font> Cla. <$$font> I am sure she is one of the best Women in the
World . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.175

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Any one but a Brute might be happy with
such a Wife . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.176

<font> Cla. <$$font> He that ca@ @n't , I am sure can be happy with no
Woman . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.177

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Oh ! that I had but a jealous Husband for
one Month . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.178

<font> Cla. <$$font> Heav'n forbid , I shou'd ever have one .
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.179

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> So the Enemy is reinforc'd ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.180

and Bravery can hold out no longer . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.181

<font> Cla. <$$font> Dear Uncle , you shall go and comfort her , and
ask her Pardon . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.182

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> She is too good , if she forgives such base
Suspicions . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.183

<font> Cla. <$$font> I am sure she never gave you any Reason for them .
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.184

I do@ @n't believe , she wou'd do any thing to bring her Conduct into
Question for the World . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.185

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> She is too cautious .
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.186

If I was in her Case , I@ @'d make the House too hot for him .
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.187

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> So it is already . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.188

Who@ @'s there ? FIELDING1-1735-2,21.189

bring my Chariot this Instant , FIELDING1-1735-2,21.190

or if that be not ready , get me a Chair , FIELDING1-1735-2,21.191

get me any thing , that will convey me away . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.192

<font> Enter Servant . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,21.193

<font> Serv. <$$font> Madam , Mr. <font> Gaylove <$$font> desires to
know if you are at Home . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.194

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Yes , I shall be glad to see him .
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.195

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Heav'n be prais'd , FIELDING1-1735-2,21.196

my Wife is not in a Condition to see Company . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.197

<bracket> <font> Exit . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,21.198

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Here@ @'s a Picture of Matrimony for you ,
dear <font> Clarinda <$$font> ; FIELDING1-1735-2,21.199

what say you now to a Coach and Six with such a Husband ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.200

<font> Cla. <$$font> That I had rather walk on Foot all the Days of my
Life . FIELDING1-1735-2,21.201

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> What Difference is there between <P_22> Mr.
<font> Gaylove's <$$font> Temper , and your Uncle's !
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.202

how happy wou'd a Woman be with him . FIELDING1-1735-2,22.203

<font> Cla. <$$font> I am not sure of that - FIELDING1-1735-2,22.204

Men often appear before Marriage different Creatures from what they are
after it - FIELDING1-1735-2,22.205

Besides , there is something in him so - something so - In short ,
something in him I do@ @n't like , FIELDING1-1735-2,22.206

and of all Women in the World , I shall never envy Mrs. <font> Gaylove
. <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,22.207

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> That@ @'s a Lye , I am sure
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.208

<bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> FIELDING1-1735-2,22.209

Nay , the Man is agreeable enough , FIELDING1-1735-2,22.210

he is genteel . FIELDING1-1735-2,22.211

<font> Cla. <$$font> I do@ @n't think so . FIELDING1-1735-2,22.212

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> He has a great deal of Wit .
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.213

<font> Cla. <$$font> Then he has Wisdom enough to keep it to himself .
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.214

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> And the best-natur'd Creature in the World
. FIELDING1-1735-2,22.215

<font> Cla. <$$font> It is very good-natur'd in you to think him so .
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.216

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ha , ha , ha ! Indeed and so it wou'd .
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.217

For I have been only telling you the Opinion of the World .
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.218

In my own , he has none of these Qualities : FIELDING1-1735-2,22.219

And I wonder how the World came ever to give them to him .
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.220

<font> Cla. <$$font> So do I , if he does not deserve them ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.221

for the World seldom errs on that side the Question .
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.222

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> And yet it does in him .
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.223

For to me , he is the most agreeable Creature on Earth .
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.224

<font> Cla. <$$font> Well , I can@ @not be of your Opinion -
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.225

there is somewhat in his Countenance when he smiles , so extremely
good_humour'd ; FIELDING1-1735-2,22.226

I love dearly to see him smile , FIELDING1-1735-2,22.227

and you know he@ @'s always a smiling - FIELDING1-1735-2,22.228

and his Eyes laugh so comically , FIELDING1-1735-2,22.229

and have so much Sweetness in them . FIELDING1-1735-2,22.230

Then he is the most entertaining Creature upon Earth ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.231

and I have heard some very good-natur'd Actions of his too .
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.232

The World , I dare swear does not think one whit better of him than he
deserves . FIELDING1-1735-2,22.233

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Oh , say you so , Madam ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.234

<P_23>

<font> Enter <$$font> Gaylove <font> and <$$font> Mondish .
FIELDING1-1735-2,23.236

Oh ! here he is - FIELDING1-1735-2,23.237

Are you there too ? FIELDING1-1735-2,23.238

<font> Gay . <$$font> Ladies , your Servant - FIELDING1-1735-2,23.239

To find Mrs. <font> Raffler <$$font> at Home , and without Company at
this high visiting Season , is so surprising - FIELDING1-1735-2,23.240

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Lard , I suppose you think us like those
Country Ladies you have lately convers'd with , who never owe a Visit at
the Weeks-End to any of their Husband's Tenant's Wives -
FIELDING1-1735-2,23.241

Do you think we have nothing else to do in this sweet Town , but to ride
about the Streets , to see if the Knockers of the People's Doors are
fast - FIELDING1-1735-2,23.242

Indeed you have here and there a Country-Gentlewoman <paren> her Husband
being sent up to Parliament for the Sake of his Country , and the
Destruction of his Family <$$paren> who drives regularly round the Town
to see the Streets , and her Acquaintance and Relations , that she may
know when she may be sure of meeting some one to curtsie to at the
Drawing-Room . And once a Week very charitably gives her Horses Rest at
the Expence of her Wax-Candles ; when she sits in her own Dining-Room ,
Chair-Woman of a Committee of Fools , to criticize on Fashions , and
register the Weather . FIELDING1-1735-2,23.243

<font> Gay . <$$font> But , I think , it is pity so good a Custom is
left off ; if it were only for the better Propagation of Scandal .
FIELDING1-1735-2,23.244

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> What signifies Scandal , when no one is
asham'd of doing what they have a mind to ? FIELDING1-1735-2,23.245

<font> Gay . <$$font> Yes , there is some Pleasure in spreading it ,
when it is not true . FIELDING1-1735-2,23.246

For tho' no one is asham'd of doing what they have a mind to , they may
be asham'd of being suppos'd to do what they have no mind to .
FIELDING1-1735-2,23.247

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I know very few People who are asham'd of
any thing . FIELDING1-1735-2,23.248

<font> Mon. <$$font> I believe , Madam , none of your Acquaintance have
any Reason for that Passion . FIELDING1-1735-2,23.249

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Are you sure of that ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,23.250

<font> Mon. <$$font> None who have at present that Honour at least -
FIELDING1-1735-2,23.251

For I have that good Opinion of you , that <P_24> such a Discovery wou'd
soon banish them from it . FIELDING1-1735-2,24.252

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> That , I believe , you have seen a very
late instance of . FIELDING1-1735-2,24.253

<font> Cla. <$$font> Well , since you are so sollicitous about the Song
, if you will go with me to the Spinet , you shall hear it .
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.254

My playing , Madam , I am sure , is not worth your hearing .
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.255

But since this Creature will not let me be at quiet -
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.256

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Lard , Child , I believe you do not want so
much Entreaty . FIELDING1-1735-2,24.257

I think one can never be at quiet for you , and your Musick .
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.258

<font> Cla. <$$font> Madam , I ask your Pardon .
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.259

Come , Mr. <font> Gaylove . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,24.260

<bracket> <font> Exeunt . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,24.261

<font> Mon. <$$font> I receiv'd a Letter from you this Morning , Madam
, but of a Nature so different from some I have had from you , that I
cou'd wish your Hand had been counterfeited . FIELDING1-1735-2,24.262

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> To save you the Trouble of long Speech , I
sent you a Letter , and the last I ever intend to send you ; since I
find it has not the Effect , I desir'd , which was to prevent my ever
seeing your Face again . FIELDING1-1735-2,24.263

<font> Mon. <$$font> So cruel a Banishment , so sudden , and so
unexpected , ought surely to have some Reasons given for it .
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.264

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ask your own Heart ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.265

that can suggest 'em to you . FIELDING1-1735-2,24.266

<font> Mon. <$$font> My Heart is conscious of no other , than what is
too often a Reason to your Sex , for exercising all manner of Tyranny
over us : Too much Fondness - FIELDING1-1735-2,24.267

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Fondness ! Impudence !
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.268

to pretend Fondness to a Woman , after a Week's Neglect -
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.269

Did I not meet you at an Assembly , where you made me a Bow as distant
as if we had been scarce acquainted , or rather , as if we were weary of
our Acquaintance ? FIELDING1-1735-2,24.270

<font> Mon. <$$font> Was not that hundred-eyed Monster of Jealousy ,
Sir <font> Simon <$$font> , with you ? FIELDING1-1735-2,24.271

Do you object my Care of your Reputation to want of Fondness ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.272

<P_25> Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> The old Excuse for Indifference .
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.273

I wonder Men have not contriv'd to make it Scandalous for their Wives to
be seen with 'em , that they might have an Excuse to them too :
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.274

'T@ @is likely indeed that you shou'd have more care of my Reputation
than I myself : FIELDING1-1735-2,25.275

It was not the Jealousy of my Husband , but my Rival you was aware of ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.276

and yet you was not so tender of her Reputation , but that I discover'd
her . FIELDING1-1735-2,25.277

<font> Mon. <$$font> Excellent Justice ! FIELDING1-1735-2,25.278

For since I am to be punish'd for your Falsehood , it is but just I
shou'd be convicted of it . FIELDING1-1735-2,25.279

My Sweet ! what wou'd I give to believe what you are endeavouring to
persuade me - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.280

Come , FIELDING1-1735-2,25.281

I will assist you with all my force of Credulity ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.282

for was your Opinion of my Falshood real , I would give you such
convincing Proofs to the Contrary - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.283

But your Love to another , is no more a Secret to me , than it is that I
owe to that your Slights , your Letter , and your cruel , unjust
Accusation . FIELDING1-1735-2,25.284

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Insupportable Insolence !
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.285

A Husband may plead a Title to be Jealous ; FIELDING1-1735-2,25.286

our Love is his Due - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.287

But a Wretch who owes his Happiness to our free Gift -
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.288

<font> Mon. <$$font> Faith , I think otherwise .
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.289

Love to an Husband is a Tradesman's Debt , FIELDING1-1735-2,25.290

the Law gives him the Security of your Person for it ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.291

but Love to a Gallant is a Debt of Honour , which every Gentlewoman is
oblig'd to pay - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.292

It wou'd be a Treasure indeed finely bestow'd on such a Husband as yours
. FIELDING1-1735-2,25.293

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I am henceforth resolv'd to give it to no
other . FIELDING1-1735-2,25.294

I am so much oblig'd to his good Opinion , I shou'd hate myself if I did
not try to deserve it - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.295

and by thinking me honest he shall keep me so . FIELDING1-1735-2,25.296

<font> Mon. <$$font> He must know less than I , who is so impos'd on .
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.297

But you shall not keep my Rival a Secret from me ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.298

be assur'd you shall not - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.299

I@ @'ll haunt you with that constant Assiduity , FIELDING1-1735-2,25.300

you shall not speak to a Man without my Knowledge -
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.301

You shall find that the Jealousy of twenty Husbands is not equal to that
of one abus'd Gallant . FIELDING1-1735-2,25.302

<P_26> Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Villain ! was it not you that
ruin'd me that deceiv'd me , that robb'd me of my Virtue ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.303

<font> Mon. <$$font> How have I robb'd you ? How deceiv'd you
{COM:missing_question_mark} FIELDING1-1735-2,26.304

Have I not paid you the Price of your Virtue , Eternal Constancy ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.305

Have I not met your Passion still with fresh Desires ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.306

Has not each stolen Meeting been Scene of Joy , which eager Bridegrooms
might envy {COM:missing_question_mark} FIELDING1-1735-2,26.307

What have I done to disoblige you ; FIELDING1-1735-2,26.308

or what has another done to oblige you more ? FIELDING1-1735-2,26.309

Have I been outbid in Fondness ? FIELDING1-1735-2,26.310

Has some fresh Lover burnt with warm {TEXT:warme} Passion ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.311

Has some Beau drest himself into your Heart or some Wit talk'd himself
into it ? FIELDING1-1735-2,26.312

Be generous FIELDING1-1735-2,26.313

and confess what has ruin'd me in that dear Bosom
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.314

and do not cruelly throw it on a poor harmless Husband .
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.315

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Good-manners shou'd oblige you to mention
him with more Civility to me . FIELDING1-1735-2,26.316

<font> Mon. <$$font> And after what has pass'd between us , I think you
shou'd mention him to me with less . FIELDING1-1735-2,26.317

Besides , I think you have sometimes been of my Opinion .
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.318

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Women , you know , are subject to Change
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.319

and I may think better of him , as well as worse of you .
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.320

<font> Mon. <$$font> This is trifling with my Passion , the cruellest
Insult you can put upon it - FIELDING1-1735-2,26.321

But I will find out my Rival , FIELDING1-1735-2,26.322

and will be reveng'd . FIELDING1-1735-2,26.323

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Reveng'd ! Ha , ha !
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.324

<font> Enter Colonel <$$font> Raffler . FIELDING1-1735-2,26.325

<font> Mon. <$$font> Death and Torments ! FIELDING1-1735-2,26.326

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Heyday ! FIELDING1-1735-2,26.327

What are they acting a Tragedy ? FIELDING1-1735-2,26.328

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> And how will you be reveng'd , sweet Sir ,
if you shou'd find him out - FIELDING1-1735-2,26.329

or why shou'd you desire it ? FIELDING1-1735-2,26.330

The Man acts like a Man , FIELDING1-1735-2,26.331

and does by you , as you have done by another . FIELDING1-1735-2,26.332

<font> Mon. <$$font> This Usage wou'd justify any thing .
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.333

My own Honour secures me , Madam . FIELDING1-1735-2,26.334

<P_27> Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I hope you wou'd not tell my Husband
- FIELDING1-1735-2,27.335

but he wou'd not believe it if you did . FIELDING1-1735-2,27.336

<font> Mon. <$$font> Hark ye , Madam , the Town will -
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.337

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Hold , hold , FIELDING1-1735-2,27.338

I must interpose - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.339

If you will Quarrel let it be at a distance - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.340

What will I not believe ? FIELDING1-1735-2,27.341

I@ @'ll tell you what I believe ; that you are in the wrong .
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.342

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ay , ay , you will take his Part , to be
sure . FIELDING1-1735-2,27.343

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Mr. <font> Mondish <$$font> is a Friend of
mine , FIELDING1-1735-2,27.344

and it is strange that you are eternally Quarrelling with all my Friends
. FIELDING1-1735-2,27.345

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I desire then , Sir , you wou'd keep your
Friends to yourself , FIELDING1-1735-2,27.346

for I shall not endure their Impertinence : FIELDING1-1735-2,27.347

So I@ @'ll leave you together - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.348

But I must tell your Friend one thing before I go , that I desire I may
never see his Face again - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.349

<bracket> <font> Exit . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,27.350

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> All this a Man must bear that is marry'd .
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.351

<font> Mon. <$$font> Ay , and a great deal more than this too .
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.352

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Why , it is true - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.353

and yet have a good Wife - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.354

I have the best Wife in the World , FIELDING1-1735-2,27.355

but Women have Humours . FIELDING1-1735-2,27.356

<font> Mon. <$$font> Pox take their Humours ! FIELDING1-1735-2,27.357

Let their Husbands bear 'em . FIELDING1-1735-2,27.358

Must we pay the Price of another's Folly ? FIELDING1-1735-2,27.359

- In short , Colonel , I am the most unfit Person in the World , for
that gentle Office you have assign'd me , of entertaining your Lady in
your Absence . FIELDING1-1735-2,27.360

Besides , I@ @'ll tell you a Secret - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.361

It is impossible to be very intimate and well with a Woman , without
making Love to her . FIELDING1-1735-2,27.362

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Well ; and why do@ @n't you make Love to
her ? Ha , ha ! make Love to her , indeed ! FIELDING1-1735-2,27.363

She@ @'d Love you , I believe , FIELDING1-1735-2,27.364

she@ @'d give you enough of making Love . FIELDING1-1735-2,27.365

<font> Mon. <$$font> Why do you think no one has made Love to her then
? FIELDING1-1735-2,27.366

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> I think nothing , FIELDING1-1735-2,27.367

I am sure no one ever has , FIELDING1-1735-2,27.368

for I am sure if they had , she wou'd have told me .
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.369

Perhaps that@ @'s a Secret you do@ @n't know , that she never kept one
Secret from me in her Life . FIELDING1-1735-2,27.370

I am certain , <P_28> if it were possible for her to make me a Cuckold
she wou'd tell me on@ @'t ; FIELDING1-1735-2,28.371

and it is an excellent thing to have such a Security , that one is not
one - FIELDING1-1735-2,28.372

Dear <font> Mondish <$$font> do - FIELDING1-1735-2,28.373

make Love to my Wife , FIELDING1-1735-2,28.374

let me beseech you . FIELDING1-1735-2,28.375

<font> Mon. <$$font> Excuse me , dear Colonel - FIELDING1-1735-2,28.376

but I@ @'ll do as well , FIELDING1-1735-2,28.377

I@ @'ll recommend one to you that shall . FIELDING1-1735-2,28.378

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ay , who is he ? FIELDING1-1735-2,28.379

<font> Mon. <$$font> What think you of Mr. <font> Gaylove <$$font> ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.380

Beside , I believe it will please your Lady better .
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.381

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ha , ha , ha ! I cou'd die with laughing .
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.382

Ha ! ha , ha ! this is the Man now that knows the World , and Mankind
, and Womankind . FIELDING1-1735-2,28.383

You have happen'd to name the very Man whom she detests of all Men
breathing . FIELDING1-1735-2,28.384

She told me so this very Morning . FIELDING1-1735-2,28.385

<font> Mon. <$$font> Then I am satisfy'd . FIELDING1-1735-2,28.386

Damnation and Hell ! FIELDING1-1735-2,28.387

Now can I scarce forbear telling this Fellow he is a Cuckold to his Face
- FIELDING1-1735-2,28.388

'Sdeath I have hit of a Way . FIELDING1-1735-2,28.389

<bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> FIELDING1-1735-2,28.390

Hark@ @'e , Colonel , FIELDING1-1735-2,28.391

you have put a very pleasant Conceit into my Head .
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.392

I think I have heard you say , that you have a great Pleasure in seeing
the Disdain your Lady shews to all Mankind - FIELDING1-1735-2,28.393

Now I have the same Pleasure - FIELDING1-1735-2,28.394

Suppose therefore it was possible to work up <font> Gaylove <$$font> to
make his Addresses to her , FIELDING1-1735-2,28.395

and you and I cou'd convey ourselves where we might see her treat him as
he deserves . FIELDING1-1735-2,28.396

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> I like it vastly : FIELDING1-1735-2,28.397

How I shall hug myself all the while , FIELDING1-1735-2,28.398

I know exactly how she will behave to him . FIELDING1-1735-2,28.399

I shall certainly die with Pleasure ; FIELDING1-1735-2,28.400

let me tell you , my Dear , let me tell you , there is a great deal of
Pride in having a virtuous Wife . FIELDING1-1735-2,28.401

<font> Mon. <$$font> If Brilliants were not scarce they would not be
valuable : FIELDING1-1735-2,28.402

And Virtue in a Wife perhaps may be valu'd for the same reason .
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.403

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> But do you think he can be brought to it ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.404

<font> Mon. <$$font> I warrant him , FIELDING1-1735-2,28.405

he has Vanity enough to be easily persuaded that a Woman may be fond of
him , and <P_29> Gallantry enough not to let her Fondness be thrown away
. FIELDING1-1735-2,29.406

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> I am charm'd with the Contrivance .
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.407

But he must never know that I knew any thing of the Matter .
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.408

I sha@ @n't know how to behave to him if he shou'd .
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.409

<font> Mon. <$$font> You may learn from half your Acquaintance .
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.410

How many Husbands do we see caressing Men , whose intrigues with their
Wives , they must be blinder than Darkness itself not to see !
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.411

It is a civil Communicative Age we live in , Colonel .
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.412

And it is no more a Breach of Friendship to make use of your Wife , than
of your Chariot . FIELDING1-1735-2,29.413

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> It is a devilish Cuckolding Age ,

FIELDING1-1735-2,29.419

The Joy , the Pride , the Triumph is to see The Ills a Neighbour in a

Act III . FIELDING1-1735-2,29.422

Scene I . FIELDING1-1735-2,29.423

<$$heading>

Scene , <font> A Street <$$font> . {TEXT:..} FIELDING1-1735-2,29.425

Mondish , Gaylove . FIELDING1-1735-2,29.426

<font> Gay . <$$font> And art thou really in earnest ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.427

and art thou perfectly sure , she has this Passion for me ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.428

<font> Mon. <$$font> Thou art blind thyself FIELDING1-1735-2,29.429

or thou must have discover'd it , FIELDING1-1735-2,29.430

all her Looks , Words , Actions betray it . FIELDING1-1735-2,29.431

<font> Gay . <$$font> Thou art a nice Observer , <font> George ,
<$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,29.432

and perhaps in this Case , your own Passion may heighten your Suspicions
; FIELDING1-1735-2,29.433

I know thy Temper is inclin'd to Jealousy . FIELDING1-1735-2,29.434

<P_30>

<font> Mon. <$$font> Far from it ; FIELDING1-1735-2,30.436

I never doubt the Affection of a Woman while she is kind ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.437

nor ever think any more of 'em when she grows otherwise .
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.438

Women undoubtedly are Blessings {TEXT:Blessing} to us , if we do not ,
our_selves make 'em otherwise . FIELDING1-1735-2,30.439

I have just Love enough to assist 'em in giving me Pleasure , but not to
put it in their power to give me Pain ; FIELDING1-1735-2,30.440

and I cou'd with as much Ease see thee in the Arms of Mrs. <font>
Raffler , <font> as of any Woman in Town . FIELDING1-1735-2,30.441

<font> Gay . <$$font> Wou'd'st thou ? FIELDING1-1735-2,30.442

She@ @'s young , handsome , and witty , FIELDING1-1735-2,30.443

and faith ! I cou'd almost as soon wish myself there .
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.444

'T@ @is true , I have an honourable Engagement FIELDING1-1735-2,30.445

but a Man's having settled his whole Estate , shou'd not prevent his
being charitable , <font> George . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,30.446

<font> Mon. <$$font> Especially when what he bestows does not hurt his
Estate . FIELDING1-1735-2,30.447

<font> Gay . <$$font> Very true ; FIELDING1-1735-2,30.448

therefore if I was sure the Lady was in Necessity , I do@ @n't know how
far my Good Nature might carry me , FIELDING1-1735-2,30.449

for the Devil take me if I am not one of the best-natur'd Creatures in
the World . FIELDING1-1735-2,30.450

<font> Mon. <$$font> I think I am acting a very good-natur'd part too ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.451

a Man is oblig'd in honour to provide for a Cast Mistress ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.452

but I do more , FIELDING1-1735-2,30.453

I provide for a Mistress who has cast me off . FIELDING1-1735-2,30.454

<font> Gay . <$$font> I begin to suspect thou hast some Design of
making me an Instrument in your Reconciliation ; FIELDING1-1735-2,30.455

I do@ @n't see how my Addresses can be of any Use to you ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.456

but if they can , they are at your Service . FIELDING1-1735-2,30.457

<font> Mon. <$$font> I thank you with all my Heart ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.458

they serve me at least , so far , as to discover whether you are my
innocent Rival , or whether I am to seek for him elsewhere :
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.459

besides , if you are really the Person , and do@ @n't care to be
charitable , as you call it , by playing Captain <font> Spark <$$font>
with her , you may pique her back again to me . FIELDING1-1735-2,30.460

<font> Gay . <$$font> Ha , ha , ha ! FIELDING1-1735-2,30.461

<font> Mon. <$$font> Pri@ @thee what do'st thou laugh at ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.462

<font> Gay . <$$font> To see so cool a Lover as thou art , who cares
for a Woman no longer than she is kind , take such Pains to get her
again , after she has jilted you . FIELDING1-1735-2,30.463

<P_31>

<font> Mon. <$$font> Pshaw ! that - I well - FIELDING1-1735-2,31.465

<font> Gay . <$$font> Ha , ha , ha ! FIELDING1-1735-2,31.466

<font> Mon. <$$font> You are merry , Sir , FIELDING1-1735-2,31.467

- But I wou'd not have you think that I have any Love for her -
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.468

She has hurt my Pride ; FIELDING1-1735-2,31.469

't@ @is that , and not my Love that I want to cure -
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.470

Damn her ! FIELDING1-1735-2,31.471

If I had her but in my Power ; cou'd I but triumph over her , I shou'd
have the End of my Desires , FIELDING1-1735-2,31.472

and then , if her Husband , or the Town , or the Devil had her , it
wou'd give me no Pain . FIELDING1-1735-2,31.473

<font> Gay . <$$font> I dare swear thou wilt use thy Power very gently
. FIELDING1-1735-2,31.474

I shall sup there this Evening , FIELDING1-1735-2,31.475

and if I have an Opportunity with her , I@ @'ll do thee all the Service
I can , tho' I ca@ @n't promise to behave exactly up to the Character of
Captain <font> Spark <$$font> , if she shou'd be very kind .
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.476

<font> Mon. <$$font> Well , make use of your Victory as you please .
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.477

<font> Gay <$$font> But me@ @thinks you take a preposterous Way .
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.478

Wou'd it not be better to alarm her with another Mistress ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.479

<font> Mon. <$$font> That , perhaps , I intend too .
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.480

<font> Gay . <$$font> I have overstay'd my time with you ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.481

- besides I see coming for whose Company I have no great Relish -
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.482

So , your Servant . FIELDING1-1735-2,31.483

<bracket> <font> Exit . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,31.484

<font> Mon. <$$font> Whom ? FIELDING1-1735-2,31.485

O , Sir <font> Simon . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,31.486

I@ @'ll avoid him too . FIELDING1-1735-2,31.487

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Simon . FIELDING1-1735-2,31.488

<font> Sir Sim. <$$font> Mr. <font> Mondish , <$$font> Mr. <font>
Mondish <$$font> - is there anything frightful in me , that you run away
from me ? FIELDING1-1735-2,31.489

I {COM:missing_"I"} fancy my Horns are out , and People think I shall
butt at 'em - FIELDING1-1735-2,31.490

As for that handsome Gentleman , who sneak'd off so prettily , I shall
not go after him , FIELDING1-1735-2,31.491

- and I wish I may have seen the last of him with all my Heart -
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.492

Is he an Acquaintance of yours , pray ? FIELDING1-1735-2,31.493

For I saw you speak to him . FIELDING1-1735-2,31.494

<font> Mon. <$$font> Ay , Sir <font> Simon . <$$font>
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.495

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> I am sorry for it , FIELDING1-1735-2,31.496

I am sorry you keep such Company . FIELDING1-1735-2,31.497

<font> Mon. <$$font> How so , Sir <font> Simon ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.498

<$$font> he@ @'s a Man of Honour , I {COM:missing_"I"} hope .
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.499

<P_32> Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Oh , a Man of very nice Honour , I dare
answer for him , and one who lies with every Man's Wife he comes near .
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.500

<font> Mon. <$$font> Indeed I fear he has been guilty of some small
Offences that way . FIELDING1-1735-2,32.501

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Small Offences ! FIELDING1-1735-2,32.502

and yet to break open a House , or rob on the Highway are great Offences
. FIELDING1-1735-2,32.503

A Man that robs me of five Shillings is a Rogue , and to be hang'd ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.504

but he that robs me of my Wife , is a fine Gentleman , and a Man of
Honour . FIELDING1-1735-2,32.505

<font> Mon. <$$font> The Laws shou'd be severer on these Occasions .
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.506

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> The Laws shou'd give us more Power over our
Wives . FIELDING1-1735-2,32.507

If a Man was to carry his Treasure about openly among Thieves , I
believe the Laws wou'd be very little Security to him .
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.508

<font> Mon. <$$font> And as to prevent Robbing they have put down all
Night-houses , and other Places of Rendezvous , so to prevent Cuckoldom
, we shou'd put down all Assemblies , Balls , Operas , Plays , in short
, all the Publick Places . FIELDING1-1735-2,32.509

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Ay , ay , Publick Places , as they call 'em
are intended only to give People an Opportunity of getting acquainted ,
and appointing to meet in Private Places . FIELDING1-1735-2,32.510

<font> Mon. <$$font> An Assembly , Sir <font> Simon , <$$font> is an
Exchange for Cuckoldom , where the Traders meet , and make their
Bargains , and then adjourn to a private Room to sign and seal .
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.511

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Mr. <font> Mondish , <$$font> I know you are
my Friend ; FIELDING1-1735-2,32.512

there has been a long Acquaintance and Friendship between our Families ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.513

I shall tell you , therefore , what I wou'd not tell any other Living .
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.514

I have not the least Jealousy in my Temper , FIELDING1-1735-2,32.515

but I have a Wife that wou'd make the Devil Jealous -
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.516

Oh , here comes the Man I have been looking after .
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.517

<font> Mon. <$$font> Sir <font> Simon , <$$font> your humble Servant .
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.518

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Nay , but stay a Moment .
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.519

<P_33> <font> Mon. <$$font> I have business of Consequence ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.520

and ca@ @n't possibly - FIELDING1-1735-2,33.521

Your humble Servant . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.522

<bracket> <font> Exit . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,33.523

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Well , your Servant . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.524

<font> Enter Captain <$$font> Spark . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.525

What in the Name of Mischief is he reading ? FIELDING1-1735-2,33.526

A Letter from my Wife , I suppose . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.527

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Sir , your most humble Servant -
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.528

I think I had the Honour of seeing you at my Cousin <font> Mondish
<$$font> 's this Morning . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.529

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Yes Sir , and I shou'd be glad to have the
Honour of seeing you hang'd this Afternoon . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.530

<bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> FIELDING1-1735-2,33.531

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Pray , Sir , what@ @'s a Clock ? because
I have an Engagement at Six . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.532

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Oh , Sir , it wants considerably of that ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.533

but perhaps your Engagement is with a Lady , FIELDING1-1735-2,33.534

and that makes the Time longer . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.535

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Why , faith ! to be sincere with you ,
it is ; FIELDING1-1735-2,33.536

but I beg you wou'd not mention that to any body ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.537

tho' if you shou'd , as long as you do@ @n't know her Name , there@ @'s
no Reputation hurt . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.538

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> I Suppose , Captain , it is she whom you met
at the Auction . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.539

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> How the Devil came you to guess that ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.540

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Well , but I have guess'd right .
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.541

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> I am not oblig'd to tell -
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.542

but this I will tell you , FIELDING1-1735-2,33.543

Sir , you have a very good knack at guessing . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.544

And yet I will shew you her Christian Name , and lay you a Wager you do@
@n't find out her Sirname . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.545

Sir <font> Sim. Anne , <$$font> the Devil ! FIELDING1-1735-2,33.546

It is not my Wife's Hand , FIELDING1-1735-2,33.547

but it is her Name . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.548

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Hold , Sir , FIELDING1-1735-2,33.549

that is not fair . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.550

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Let me but see the two first Letters of her
Sirname . FIELDING1-1735-2,33.551

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> To oblige you , you shall -
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.552

but if you shou'd guess afterwards , you are a Man of Honour .
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.553

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Sir , I am satisfy'd .
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.554

- I am the happiest Man in the World - FIELDING1-1735-2,33.555

dear Captain , I give you ten_thousand <P_34> Thanks .
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.556

You have quieted my Curiosity . FIELDING1-1735-2,34.557

I thought , by your Description this Morning , you had meant another
Lady . FIELDING1-1735-2,34.558

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Whom did you think ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.559

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Really I thought the Lady's Name was <font>
Raffler <$$font> , whom you describ'd . FIELDING1-1735-2,34.560

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Mrs. <font> Raffler , <$$font> indeed ,
ha , ha ! FIELDING1-1735-2,34.561

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Why , do you know Mrs. <font> Raffler ?
<$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,34.562

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Know her , Ay , FIELDING1-1735-2,34.563

who the Devil does not know her ? FIELDING1-1735-2,34.564

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What , what , what do you know of her ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.565

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Pugh , know of her ! ha , ha !
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.566

Lard help you , FIELDING1-1735-2,34.567

know of her indeed - and with a grave face as if you had never heard any
thing of us two . FIELDING1-1735-2,34.568

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> My Brother is an errant downright Cuckold .
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.569

I never was better pleas'd with any News in my Life .
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.570

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Is she a Relation of yours , that you are
so anxious ? FIELDING1-1735-2,34.571

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> No , Sir , no , no Relation of mine , upon my
Honour - FIELDING1-1735-2,34.572

I have some Acquaintance with a Lady of her Name , one Lady <font>
Raffler . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,34.573

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Ay , that@ @'s a good one too .
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.574

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What , do you know my Lady <font> Raffler ?
<$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,34.575

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Yes , I think I do .
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.576

Ha , ha , ha - faith ! I remember that Woman , a very fine Woman ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.577

nay , she@ @'s well enough still , FIELDING1-1735-2,34.578

I ca@ @n't help saying I like her better than her Sister .
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.579

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> I suppose you have had 'em both .
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.580

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Who I ? FIELDING1-1735-2,34.581

ha , ha , ha ! no , no , neither of 'em ; FIELDING1-1735-2,34.582

you are the most Suspicious Person , tho' I believe the World has talk'd
pretty freely . FIELDING1-1735-2,34.583

But , ha , ha ! the World you know is a censorious World ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.584

and yet Pox take the Women ! FIELDING1-1735-2,34.585

they owe more Discoveries to their own Imprudence .
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.586

I never had a Woman fond of me in my Life , that was able to conceal it
; FIELDING1-1735-2,34.587

if I had had her , it might have been a Secret for me .
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.588

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Well , Sir , it is no Secret , I assure you -
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.589

ten_thousand Devils take 'em both ! FIELDING1-1735-2,34.590

<bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,34.591

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> I defy any one to say he ever heard me
brag of my Amours , FIELDING1-1735-2,34.592

and yet I have had a few . FIELDING1-1735-2,34.593

<P_35> Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> And you have had Lady <font> Raffler
<$$font> then ? FIELDING1-1735-2,35.594

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> No , that@ @'s too much to own .
FIELDING1-1735-2,35.595

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Not at all ; FIELDING1-1735-2,35.596

no one is asham'd to own their Amours now - FIELDING1-1735-2,35.597

fine Gentlemen talk of Women of Quality , in the same manner as of their
Laundresses . FIELDING1-1735-2,35.598

Besides it is known already , FIELDING1-1735-2,35.599

you may own it , especially to me ; FIELDING1-1735-2,35.600

for it shall go no farther , I assure you . FIELDING1-1735-2,35.601

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Well then , in Confidence that you are a
Man of Honour , I will own it to you ; FIELDING1-1735-2,35.602

yes , yes , I have , I have had her . FIELDING1-1735-2,35.603

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Wou'd the Devil had had you .
FIELDING1-1735-2,35.604

Now , if I had the Spirit of a Worm , I wou'd beat this Fellow to Death
; FIELDING1-1735-2,35.605

but I think I have Spirit enough to beat my Wife .
FIELDING1-1735-2,35.606

She shall pay for all ; and that immediately . FIELDING1-1735-2,35.607

Your Servant . FIELDING1-1735-2,35.608

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> I hope you wo@ @n't discover a Word ,
since I place such Confidence in you . FIELDING1-1735-2,35.609

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Never fear me , Sir - FIELDING1-1735-2,35.610

I am much beholden to your Confidence , FIELDING1-1735-2,35.611

I am very much beholden to you . FIELDING1-1735-2,35.612

Cuckolds ! FIELDING1-1735-2,35.613

Horns ! FIELDING1-1735-2,35.614

Daggers ! FIELDING1-1735-2,35.615

Fire and Furies ! FIELDING1-1735-2,35.616

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> The Gentleman seems in a Passion .
FIELDING1-1735-2,35.618

Now do@ @n't I know what in the World to do with my_self .
FIELDING1-1735-2,35.619

- hum , hum , FIELDING1-1735-2,35.620

I hear <font> Clarinda <$$font> 's in Town , FIELDING1-1735-2,35.621

I@ @'ll go try if I ca@ @n't find her out . FIELDING1-1735-2,35.622

FIELDING1-1735-2,35.626

<font> Enter <$$font> Gaylove , Clarinda . FIELDING1-1735-2,35.627

<$$heading>

<font> Cla. <$$font> And so you have told Captain <font> Spark <$$font>
I am in Town , FIELDING1-1735-2,35.629

I am very much oblig'd to you . FIELDING1-1735-2,35.630

<font> Gay . <$$font> It shews you , at least , I am not of Sir <font>
Simon's <f$$> Temper , not inclin'd to Jealousy .
FIELDING1-1735-2,35.631

<font> Cla. <$$font> No ; People are never jealous of what@ @'s
indifferent to them . FIELDING1-1735-2,35.632

<font> Gay . <$$font> Faith , I have no Notion of being so at all ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,35.633

for if there can be no Jealousy without Fondness , I am sure <P_36> I
cou'd never be fond of any Woman who wou'd give me Reason to be jealous
. FIELDING1-1735-2,36.634

<font> Cla. <$$font> Yes , but some Men are Jealous without any Reason
. FIELDING1-1735-2,36.635

<font> Gay . <$$font> And some Men are fond without any Reason .
FIELDING1-1735-2,36.636

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Look ye , Sir , as for me , I@ @'m an honest
sober Citizen , FIELDING1-1735-2,42.842

and shall take my Revenge another way FIELDING1-1735-2,42.843

but my Brother here , is a fighting Man , FIELDING1-1735-2,42.844

and will return your Favour as fighting Men generally do return Favours
, by cutting your Throat . FIELDING1-1735-2,42.845

Hark@ @'e Brother FIELDING1-1735-2,42.846

you do@ @n't deserve it of me , FIELDING1-1735-2,42.847

yet I must let you know that this Gentleman assur'd me to Day , that he
had done you the Favour with your Wife . FIELDING1-1735-2,42.848

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> With me ! FIELDING1-1735-2,42.849

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> What Favour ? FIELDING1-1735-2,42.850

<P_43>

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> The Favour , the only Favour which fine
Gentlemen do such Sort of People as us ; FIELDING1-1735-2,43.852

but be not dejected , Brother , FIELDING1-1735-2,43.853

I am your Fellow-sufferer , FIELDING1-1735-2,43.854

he has had my Wife too , FIELDING1-1735-2,43.855

he confess'd it to my Face . FIELDING1-1735-2,43.856

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Not I , upon my Soul , Sir -
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.857

a likely thing I shou'd say that I had an Amour with a Woman that I
never saw before , to my Knowledge ! FIELDING1-1735-2,43.858

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> And have you the Assurance to deny to my face
- FIELDING1-1735-2,43.859

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> I think , Sir , your Assurance is greater
, to {COM:missing_"to"} assert a thing to my Face , which I never said ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.860

I never {TEXT:word_unclear} nam'd either of the Ladies in my Life .
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.861

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What , Sir ! did you not mention Mrs. <font>
Raffler <$$font> 's Name ? FIELDING1-1735-2,43.862

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Mrs. <font> Raffler ! <$$font>
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.863

Oh , then it is out - FIELDING1-1735-2,43.864

What a Confusion had the Mistake of a Name like to {TEXT:missing_"to"}
have occasion'd ? FIELDING1-1735-2,43.865

Ladies , I am under the greatest concern , that I shou'd be ev'n the
innocent Occasion of the least Uneasiness to you .
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.866

But I believe , Sir , I shall end {TEXT:word_unclear} yours , when I
have put my_self to the Blush , by confessing that it was only a <font>
Dutch <$$font> Lady of Pleasure , whom I knew in <font> Amsterdam
<$$font> , that caus'd your Jealousy . FIELDING1-1735-2,43.867

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What ! FIELDING1-1735-2,43.868

and did not you name my Lady <font> Raffler <$$font> too ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.869

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Yes , sometimes she is call'd Mrs.
<font> Raffler , <$$font> and sometimes my Lady <font> Raffler .
<$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,43.870

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> An impudent Jade ! FIELDING1-1735-2,43.871

ha , ha , ha ! FIELDING1-1735-2,43.872

ay , it@ @'s common enough with 'em to have several Names and titles -
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.873

Come , come Brother , FIELDING1-1735-2,43.874

all you have to do , is to ask Pardon of the Gentleman , and your Wife
and mine - FIELDING1-1735-2,43.875

Are not you asham'd to put all the Company into this Confusion , because
there is a Woman of the Town , who wears the same Name with your own
Wife ? FIELDING1-1735-2,43.876

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> A Man has some Reason for Confusion ; tho' let
me tell you , when a Gentleman , who does not know him , tells him to
his Face , that he has lain with a Woman , who wears the same Name with
his Wife . FIELDING1-1735-2,43.877

And I think he may be excus'd , if he thinks she wears the same Cloaths
too . FIELDING1-1735-2,43.878

<P_44> Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Sir , I am very sorry , any thing of
this {TEXT:word_unclear} Nature shou'd happen . FIELDING1-1735-2,44.879

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Oh , Sir , things of this Nature are
unusual with me , FIELDING1-1735-2,44.880

I beg no Apology . FIELDING1-1735-2,44.881

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Please Heav'n ! FIELDING1-1735-2,44.882

I@ @'ll make a Voyage to <font> Holland <$$font> , and search all the
Bawdy-houses in <font> Amsterdam <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,44.883

but I will find out whether there be such a Woman or no .
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.884

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Come , Brother , FIELDING1-1735-2,44.885

ask the Gentleman's Pardon - FIELDING1-1735-2,44.886

I am asham'd of you . FIELDING1-1735-2,44.887

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Well , Sir , <paren> I do@ @n't know how to do
it <$$paren> FIELDING1-1735-2,44.888

if I have injur'd you , I ask your Pardon ; FIELDING1-1735-2,44.889

and yet I ca@ @n't help thinking still , it was my Lady <font> Raffler
<$$font> you mention'd , FIELDING1-1735-2,44.890

and I believe you spoke Truth too . FIELDING1-1735-2,44.891

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> Sir , I can easily forgive you suspecting
me to be the happiest Person upon Earth ; FIELDING1-1735-2,44.892

if you have this Lady's Pardon , you have mine .
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.893

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What , is the Rascal making love to her before
my Face ? FIELDING1-1735-2,44.894

But I wo@ @n't give him an Opportunity of cutting my Throat before hers
; FIELDING1-1735-2,44.895

for I wou'd not willingly give her so much Pleasure .
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.896

<font> Cla. <$$font> I believe , Madam , the Captain will make a
{TEXT:missing_"a"} fourth at Quadrille . FIELDING1-1735-2,44.897

Cap. <font> Spark . <$$font> You honour me too much , Madam ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.898

but if you will bear with a very bad Player - FIELDING1-1735-2,44.899

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Tho' I hate Cards , I will play with him if
it be only to torment my Husband . FIELDING1-1735-2,44.900

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> This is opportune enough -
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.901

I will see 'em together , FIELDING1-1735-2,44.902

and shall soon get some one to hold my Cards , while I go to a better
Appointment . FIELDING1-1735-2,44.903

Come , if you will follow me , I@ @'ll conduct you to the Cards .
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.904

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,44.905

<font> Manent Sir <$$font> Simon , <font> and Colonel <$$font> Raffler .
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.906

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> This is mighty pretty , mighty fine , truly .
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.907

This is a rare Country , and a rare Age we live in where a Man is
oblig'd to put his Horns in his Pocket , whether he will or no .
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.908

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Fye upon you , Brother , fye upon you .
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.909

For you , who have one of the most virtuous Women in the World to your
Wife , to be thus tormenting <P_45> your_self and her , your Friends and
every one , with those groundless Suspicions , such unheard_of
Jealousies ! FIELDING1-1735-2,45.910

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Sir , you injure me , if you call me jealous ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.911

I have not a Grain of Jealousy within me . FIELDING1-1735-2,45.912

I am not indeed so foolishly blind as you are . FIELDING1-1735-2,45.913

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> And you injure me , if you think I am not
jealous ; FIELDING1-1735-2,45.914

I am all over Jealousy , FIELDING1-1735-2,45.915

and if there was at the least Occasion to shew it -
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.916

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Occasion ! FIELDING1-1735-2,45.917

why is not your Wife at this very Instant at Cards with a young Fellow ?
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.918

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Well , Sir , and is not your Wife with her
? FIELDING1-1735-2,45.919

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Sore against my Will , I assure you -
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.920

What , I suppose , you are one of those wise Men , who think one Woman
is a Guard upon another - FIELDING1-1735-2,45.921

now , it is my Opinion , that a Plurality of Women only tend to the
making a Plurality of Cuckolds . FIELDING1-1735-2,45.922

Thieves , indeed , discover one another , because the Discoverer often
saves his Life by it - FIELDING1-1735-2,45.923

But Women do not save their Reputations after the same manner ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.924

and therefore every Woman keeps her Neighbour's secret , in order to
have her own kept . FIELDING1-1735-2,45.925

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Pshaw ! Sir , I do@ @n't rely upon this ,
nor that , nor t'other , FIELDING1-1735-2,45.926

I rely upon my Wife's Virtue . FIELDING1-1735-2,45.927

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Why truly Sir , that is not relying upon this
, nor that , nor t'other , FIELDING1-1735-2,45.928

for it is relying upon nothing at all . FIELDING1-1735-2,45.929

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> How , Sir ! do@ @n't you think my Wife
virtuous ? FIELDING1-1735-2,45.930

- Now Sir , to shew you to your Confusion , what an excellent Creature
this is , I gave her leave once to go to a Masquerade ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.931

and follow'd her thither my_self , where tho' I knew her Dress , I did
not find her , FIELDING1-1735-2,45.932

- and where do you think she was ? FIELDING1-1735-2,45.933

Where do you think this good Creature was ? but at supper in private ,
with a poor Female Relation of hers , who keeps a Milliner's Shop at St.
<font> James <$$font> 's . FIELDING1-1735-2,45.934

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> O Lud ! O Lud ! O Lud !
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.935

- and are you , brother , really wise enough to think she was there -
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.936

or if she was there , do you think she was alone , with this poor Female
Relation ? who is a Relation of mine <P_46> too , I thank Heav'n , and
is , I dare swear , as useful a {TEXT:missing_"a"} Woman as any in the
Parish of St. <font> James <$$font> 's . FIELDING1-1735-2,46.937

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Brother , you are - FIELDING1-1735-2,46.938

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What am I , Brother ? -
FIELDING1-1735-2,46.939

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> I can bear this no longer .
FIELDING1-1735-2,46.940

You are - I need not tell you , FIELDING1-1735-2,46.941

you know what you are - FIELDING1-1735-2,46.942

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> And I know what you are too ,
FIELDING1-1735-2,46.943

you are a Cuckold , FIELDING1-1735-2,46.944

and so am I , I dare swear - Notwithstanding this Evasion of the
Captain's , FIELDING1-1735-2,46.945

however , I shall not rest so - FIELDING1-1735-2,46.946

If I am what I think , I will make an ample Discovery of it ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,46.947

tho' if I was to find them in one another's Arms , the poor Husband
wou'd always be found in the Wrong . FIELDING1-1735-2,46.948
