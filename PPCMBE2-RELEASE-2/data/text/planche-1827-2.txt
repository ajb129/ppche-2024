The Green-eyed Monster . PLANCHE-1827-2,9.4

Act I . PLANCHE-1827-2,9.5

Scene I . PLANCHE-1827-2,9.6

- <font> A Shrubbery in the Grounds of Baron Speyenhausen . <$$font>
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.7

<$$heading>

<font> Enter <$$font> Colonel Arnsdorf <font> and <$$font> Marcus , L.
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.9

<font> Col. <$$font> Not approach the house , when my love is returned
, and my intentions are honourable ? PLANCHE-1827-2,9.10

<font> Mar. <$$font> Not during the baron's absence , sir .
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.11

He is expected home to-morrow , PLANCHE-1827-2,9.12

and then - PLANCHE-1827-2,9.13

<font> Col. <$$font> To-morrow ! to-morrow ! PLANCHE-1827-2,9.14

- why should I be debarred for a moment the sight of my Amelia ?
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.15

- what could the baron say ? PLANCHE-1827-2,9.16

<font> Mar. <$$font> He would say nothing , sir - nothing but what
would be perfectly polite and gentlemanly . PLANCHE-1827-2,9.17

His consent , indeed , you might hope in vain for ; PLANCHE-1827-2,9.18

but his reception of you would be the most fascinating thing possible .
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.19

How fortunate for you , sir , that I should not only have entered the
baron's service within the last six months , but be the first person you
met upon the grounds . PLANCHE-1827-2,9.20

If any one else had seen you , you@ @'d have been ruined , sir .
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.21

<font> Col. <$$font> What do you mean ? PLANCHE-1827-2,9.22

<font> Mar. <$$font> You do@ @n't know the baron , sir ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.23

nor do you seem aware of the crime you have committed .
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.24

<font> Col. <$$font> Crime ! PLANCHE-1827-2,9.25

what crime ? PLANCHE-1827-2,9.26

<font> Mar. <$$font> Why , sir , you have fallen desperately in love
with Lady Speyenhausen . PLANCHE-1827-2,9.27

<font> Col. <$$font> With the baroness ! PLANCHE-1827-2,9.28

what do you mean by this impertinence ? PLANCHE-1827-2,9.29

<font> Mar. <$$font> Nay , sir , do@ @n't be angry with me :
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.30

her husband believes you have , which is exactly the same thing , as far
as he is concerned ; PLANCHE-1827-2,9.31

and that belief is not likely to be shaken by the report that , during
his absence , you <P_10> have jumped over a quickset hedge into his
shrubbery , instead of ringing the great bell in the forecourt , and
leaving a card with the porter . PLANCHE-1827-2,10.32

<font> Col. <$$font> Psha ! it saved my going a mile about ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.33

and , so far from knowing he was absent , I came expressly to see him ,
to ask the hand of his ward ; PLANCHE-1827-2,10.34

and I shall await his return in her company . PLANCHE-1827-2,10.35

<font> Mar. <$$font> Then , sir , I repeat , you@ @'ll ruin all .
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.36

- You are the suspected person - PLANCHE-1827-2,10.37

your attentions at a certain fancy ball in Munich - <font> Col.
<$$font> Were directed to Amelia . PLANCHE-1827-2,10.38

<font> Mar. <$$font> You followed the carriage home - <font> Col.
<$$font> To discover the residence of Amelia . PLANCHE-1827-2,10.39

<font> Mar. <$$font> You prowled about the house , night after night ,
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.40

and serenaded yourself into a quinsey - <font> Col. <$$font> For Amelia
! for Amelia ! PLANCHE-1827-2,10.41

I had not then my father's consent , PLANCHE-1827-2,10.42

and was compelled to be very cautious in my proceedings .
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.43

<font> Mar. <$$font> Have you it now , sir ? PLANCHE-1827-2,10.44

<font> Col. <$$font> I have . PLANCHE-1827-2,10.45

<font> Mar. <$$font> In writing ? PLANCHE-1827-2,10.46

<font> Col. <$$font> No ; PLANCHE-1827-2,10.47

but - PLANCHE-1827-2,10.48

<font> Mar. <$$font> There it is , sir ; PLANCHE-1827-2,10.49

you have nothing to prove your affection is really for Mademoiselle
Amelia . PLANCHE-1827-2,10.50

<font> Col. <$$font> 'Sdeath ! PLANCHE-1827-2,10.51

when I come to ask her in marriage ? PLANCHE-1827-2,10.52

<font> Mar. <$$font> It does not signify , PLANCHE-1827-2,10.53

the baron will consider that a mere pretence to gain admission to the
house , and approach my lady . PLANCHE-1827-2,10.54

<font> Col. <$$font> But I expect a letter , this very day , from my
father ; which I have ordered to be forwarded to Engleberg Castle to me
. PLANCHE-1827-2,10.55

<font> Mar. <$$font> Then wait till you get it , sir :
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.56

at any rate do not think of setting foot over the threshold of our house
before the baron returns . PLANCHE-1827-2,10.57

You have no idea how ingeniously he can torment himself and every one
around him - PLANCHE-1827-2,10.58

a glance , a cough , a whisper , drives him mad - PLANCHE-1827-2,10.59

explanations are idle ; PLANCHE-1827-2,10.60

for , so completely is he the slave of the green-eyed monster , that he
rather seeks to create doubts than to dissipate them ,
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.61

and tortures the clearest proofs of his folly into the strongest food
for his fear . PLANCHE-1827-2,10.62

Do you see that little girl tripping across the lawn , yonder ?
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.63

<font> Col. <$$font> What of her ? PLANCHE-1827-2,10.64

<font> Mar. <$$font> Why that , now , is one of the baron's spies ,
little Luise , an orphan , taken into his service expressly to <P_11>
watch proceedings during his absence . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.65

He has promised her in marriage to another of his creatures , Kraut the
gardener - Sour Kraut , as we call him - who is as mad as his master ,
and glories in displaying , while the baron labours to conceal , his
jealousy . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.66

<font> Col. <$$font> But , then , if she sees us together -
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.67

<font> Mar. <$$font> Oh , never mind that - PLANCHE-1827-2,11.68

she and I are great friends . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.69

Kraut worries her to death , PLANCHE-1827-2,11.70

and we have determined between us that he shall not be jealous for
nothing . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.71

But , if he should set eyes on you - PLANCHE-1827-2,11.72

<font> Col. <$$font> Oh , a few florins , I suppose -
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.73

<font> Mar. <$$font> Oh , bless you ! no sir . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.74

Incorruptible , like me . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.75

<font> Col. <$$font> Like you , indeed ! PLANCHE-1827-2,11.76

<font> Mar. <$$font> Yes , sir , like me : PLANCHE-1827-2,11.77

I@ @'m a reformed man , sir ; quite another person to the roguish ,
intriguing , fibbing , impudent fellow you knew at Vienna - who took as
many fees as a physician , and did nearly as much mischief .
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.78

My eyes are open to the enormity of my former ways , sir :
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.79

and it must be a - great - a very - great temptation , which could
induce me to return to them . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.80

<font> Col. <$$font> Ay , ay ! PLANCHE-1827-2,11.81

<font> Mar. <$$font> I@ @'m not going to be a tale-bearer , certainly ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.82

but you must expect no assistance from me , further than the mere
holding my tongue , sir . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.83

<font> Col. <$$font> Humph ! Do@ @n't you think you could hold your
hand , Marcus , if you thought I should put anything into it ?
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.84

<font> Mar. <$$font> Anything but a bribe , certainly .
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.85

<font> Col. <$$font> A bribe ! PLANCHE-1827-2,11.86

I should blush at the idea . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.87

But , since you so strongly advise me not to present myself at the house
, I wish you to deliver a letter to Amelia ; PLANCHE-1827-2,11.88

and I am sure , out of friendship for me , you will just take care of
this purse , till I ask you for it again . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.89

<font> Mar. <$$font> Friendship ! Ah ! PLANCHE-1827-2,11.90

there , now , you attack me on my weak side . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.91

What I would not have done for a mine of gold , that little word compels
me to , without a moment's hesitation . PLANCHE-1827-2,11.92

The letter shall be delivered , sir ; PLANCHE-1827-2,11.93

and , conjured by that sacred name , I put the purse in my pocket .
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.94

And now , sir , let me recommend you to retreat by the way you came ,
and lie concealed at the castle , till I give you information of the
baron's return ; PLANCHE-1827-2,11.95

then come down boldly to the house - the front way , mind you -
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.96

ring a peal on the great bell - PLANCHE-1827-2,11.97

send up your name - PLANCHE-1827-2,11.98

produce the letter you say you expect - PLANCHE-1827-2,11.99

{COM:previous_imperatives_also_part_of_the_pseudo-imperative} demand the
hand of Mademoiselle Amelia ; and he must be <P_12> madder than even I
think him , if we can@ @not convince him you have no designs upon my
lady . PLANCHE-1827-2,12.100

<font> Col. <$$font> Well , you used to be a tolerably knowing fellow ,
when you were in my uncle's service , at Vienna ; PLANCHE-1827-2,12.101

and I@ @'ll take your advice in this affair , which I confess presents
more difficulties than I could possibly have anticipated .
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.102

<bracket> <font> Takes out his pocket-book , PLANCHE-1827-2,12.103

writes in a blank leaf , PLANCHE-1827-2,12.104

tears it out , PLANCHE-1827-2,12.105

and gives it to Marcus . <$$font> <$$bracket> PLANCHE-1827-2,12.106

There@ @'s the note - PLANCHE-1827-2,12.107

deliver it directly , PLANCHE-1827-2,12.108

and give me immediate notice of the baron's return .
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.109

<bracket> <font> Crosses to <$$font> L. PLANCHE-1827-2,12.110

<font> Mar. <$$font> Mind nobody sees you jump over the hedge , sir .
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.111

<font> Col. <$$font> Ay , ay ; PLANCHE-1827-2,12.112

I@ @'ll set you an example of prudence to all marrying men -
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.113

I@ @'ll look before I leap , Marcus . PLANCHE-1827-2,12.114

<bracket> <font> Exit , <$$font> L. PLANCHE-1827-2,12.115

<font> Mar. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Looking at the purse . <$$font>
<$$bracket> So will I . PLANCHE-1827-2,12.116

Ten ducats - I think I may jump . PLANCHE-1827-2,12.117

Now that@ @'s the sort of person who ought to succeed ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.118

and it shall not be my fault if he does not . PLANCHE-1827-2,12.119

My lady should assist me in this business : PLANCHE-1827-2,12.120

it@ @'s as much to her interest as the colonel's , to convince the baron
, her niece , and not herself , is the object of his attraction .
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.121

I know the name of Arnsdorf has been wormwood to him ever since the
masked ball at Munich , from which the colonel dogged the ladies home .
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.122

Hah ! here comes Luise - PLANCHE-1827-2,12.123

what a bustle the girl seems in . PLANCHE-1827-2,12.124

<font> Enter <$$font> Luise , R. U. E. PLANCHE-1827-2,12.125

<font> Mar. <$$font> Well , Luise ; I thought you had forgotten me .
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.126

<font> Luise . <$$font> Oh , no , Mr. Marcus - PLANCHE-1827-2,12.127

but - PLANCHE-1827-2,12.128

<font> Mar. <$$font> But what ? PLANCHE-1827-2,12.129

you seem scared . PLANCHE-1827-2,12.130

<font> Luise . <$$font> Master@ @'s come home ! PLANCHE-1827-2,12.131

<font> Mar. <$$font> The baron ! PLANCHE-1827-2,12.132

why , how did he come ? PLANCHE-1827-2,12.133

I@ @'ve heard no carriage . PLANCHE-1827-2,12.134

<font> Luise . <$$font> Oh dear , no ; PLANCHE-1827-2,12.135

he must have left the carriage somewhere , and walked through the wood
to the house - PLANCHE-1827-2,12.136

for I was on the terrace , PLANCHE-1827-2,12.137

and I saw him slide down into the dry ditch , and creep close under the
wall , all the way round to the little gate in the park , open it with
his master-key , and slip in . PLANCHE-1827-2,12.138

<font> Mar. <$$font> And what did you do ? PLANCHE-1827-2,12.139

<font> Luise . <$$font> Ran to tell my lady ; PLANCHE-1827-2,12.140

but , as I went up the great staircase , he came up the back -
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.141

and so we met on the landing-place ; PLANCHE-1827-2,12.142

and he sent me down again , PLANCHE-1827-2,12.143

and told me not to say a word about his arrival , as he wished to give
my mistress a pleasurable surprise . PLANCHE-1827-2,12.144

<font> Mar. <$$font> Dear man ! that@ @'s so like him :
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.145

write to say he <P_13> shall be at home on such a day ,
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.146

then come the day before - just to give his wife a pleasant surprise ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.147

glide into the house as if he was going to steal his own silver
candlesticks - all to give his wife a pleasant surprise !
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.148

He@ @'ll get shot for a poacher , some day , by his own gamekeeper -
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.149

and that <font> will <$$font> give his wife a pleasant surprise !
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.150

Well , my little Venus , have you thought on what I said to you the
other day ? PLANCHE-1827-2,13.151

<font> Luise . <$$font> About Kraut ? PLANCHE-1827-2,13.152

<font> Mar. <$$font> Yes , my darling . PLANCHE-1827-2,13.153

You find , upon consideration , that you love me a great deal better
than you do him . PLANCHE-1827-2,13.154

<font> Luise . <$$font> Why , I do@ @n't know , because you see it@ @'s
quite another sort of love I have for him , to that which I have for you
. PLANCHE-1827-2,13.155

<font> Mar. <$$font> So I should hope , my angel :
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.156

but what@ @'s the difference , now ? PLANCHE-1827-2,13.157

You can tell me that . PLANCHE-1827-2,13.158

<font> Luise . <$$font> Oh ! I@ @'ve known Kraut ever since I was
<font> that <$$font> high , and loved him little by little , because he
told me I ought to do so - PLANCHE-1827-2,13.159

now the other love came all of a sudden - PLANCHE-1827-2,13.160

Boh ! there it was . PLANCHE-1827-2,13.161

<font> Mar. <$$font> Boh ! there it was ! PLANCHE-1827-2,13.162

Bless her unsophisticated heart ! PLANCHE-1827-2,13.163

what a nice little fellow it is ! PLANCHE-1827-2,13.164

but I must run and overtake the colonel , with the news .
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.165

I hope the baron did@ @n't catch a glimpse of him , in his retreat ,
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.166

for that would settle the business . PLANCHE-1827-2,13.167

By-by , my Hebe - one sweet kiss , PLANCHE-1827-2,13.168

and - PLANCHE-1827-2,13.169

<font> Enter <$$font> Kraut , R. U. E. PLANCHE-1827-2,13.170

<font> Kraut . <$$font> Forty_thousand devils ! PLANCHE-1827-2,13.171

<bracket> <font> Rushes between them . <$$font> PLANCHE-1827-2,13.172

<font> Mar. <$$font> Sour Kraut , by all that@ @'s unpleasant !
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.173

Run , run . PLANCHE-1827-2,13.174

Two Chairs . <$$font> PLANCHE-1827-2,13.179

<$$heading>

<font> Enter the <$$font> Baron <font> and <$$font> Lady Speyenhausen .
L. PLANCHE-1827-2,13.181

<font> Bar. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Laughing immoderately <$$font> ,
<$$bracket> Ha , ha , ha ! pardon me , my dear Lady Speyenhausen ,

but I must laugh , ha , ha , ha ! PLANCHE-1827-2,13.183

<font> Lady . <$$font> But what at , my dear ? PLANCHE-1827-2,13.184

I am delighted to see you so merry , PLANCHE-1827-2,13.185

but I can@ @not understand what particularly excites your risibility .
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.186

<font> Bar. <$$font> Ha , ha , ha ! I shall die with laughing -
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.187

it@ @'s the most comical thing in the world . PLANCHE-1827-2,13.188

<P_14>

<font> Lady . <$$font> What is comical ? PLANCHE-1827-2,14.190

Certainly , nothing you have told me - PLANCHE-1827-2,14.191

you say that the old Countess of Kirchenberg is dead , and that ,
contrary to expectation , she has not left her nephew a florin , but
bequeathed the whole of her property to an officer who was distantly
related to her - PLANCHE-1827-2,14.192

now , what is there comical in this story ? PLANCHE-1827-2,14.193

<font> Bar. <$$font> Ha , ha , ha ! It@ @'s not the story -
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.194

but you asked me in such a careless manner - " Do you know the officer ?
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.195

Is he young - handsome ? PLANCHE-1827-2,14.196

In what regiment ? " PLANCHE-1827-2,14.197

In a tone , I say , of such utter indifference , as if - ha , ha , ha !
as if it was of no earthly consequence to you , ha ! ha ! ha !
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.198

<font> Lady . <$$font> Well , and of what earthly consequence can it be
to me ? PLANCHE-1827-2,14.199

<font> Bar. <$$font> None in the least , of course ,
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.200

<bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> Shall I tell her -
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.202

PLANCHE-1827-2,14.204

<bracket> <font> Aloud . <$$font> <$$bracket> Why , the fact is , that

<font> Bar. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> The

" Oh , indeed , " as if she did@ @n't care a straw for him ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.208

but no , no - I see , now , PLANCHE-1827-2,14.209

she knew it before - PLANCHE-1827-2,14.210

there has been some communication . PLANCHE-1827-2,14.211

<bracket> <font> Aloud . <$$font> <$$bracket> Have you had any visitors

your absence . PLANCHE-1827-2,14.213

<font> Bar. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$bracket> Now
there@ @'s an evasion - PLANCHE-1827-2,14.214

she ca@ @n't give me a direct answer ; PLANCHE-1827-2,14.215

he or somebody from him has been here , there@ @'s no doubt .
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.216

<bracket> <font> Aloud . <$$font> <$$bracket> And why , Lady
Speyenhausen , pray why , may I ask , do you make a point of doing
anything so silly ? PLANCHE-1827-2,14.217

Why are our friends to be sent from our door , because I do@ @n't happen
to be at home , as if they were so many thieves or swindlers ?
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.218

'Sdeath , madam ! what are you afraid of ? PLANCHE-1827-2,14.219

or rather , what do you think I am afraid of ? PLANCHE-1827-2,14.220

For there it is , PLANCHE-1827-2,14.221

there it is , madam , - another proof of your ridiculous fancies ,
always conjuring up some visionary evil , and making me , madam , the
stalking-horse , the scapegoat , of these whimsies !
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.222

You@ @'ll get me pointed at as I walk in the streets -
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.223

I shall be mobbed and hooted for a jealous old fool - I - ha , ha , ha !
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.224

I ca@ @n't help laughing , though it annoys me , at the extreme folly of
the thing . PLANCHE-1827-2,14.225

I , who , during the five years {TEXT:years'} we have been married ,
never laid the slightest constraint upon your pleasures , your
inclinations <P_15> - I , whose extreme anxiety to escape so odious a
charge - <font> Lady . <$$font> Betrays the troubled source from whence
it springs . PLANCHE-1827-2,15.226

Baron Speyenhausen , you will excuse my finishing the sentence for you ,
and allow me also to repeat , for perhaps the hundredth time since our
marriage , that , being as anxious to avoid affording you a pretence for
jealousy , as you are to escape the suspicion of entertaining it , the
unlimited freedom to which you allude has ever been , and ever will be ,
until your nature changes , the most severe restriction that can be
imposed upon my actions . PLANCHE-1827-2,15.227

<font> Bar. <$$font> Very well , madam - as you please :

My dear colonel , this is an unexpected pleasure , ha , ha , ha ! and -
the most curious coincidence possible : PLANCHE-1827-2,15.246

the right heir has been most capriciously deprived of it ,

<bracket> <font> Exit with Colonel , <$$font> L. PLANCHE-1827-2,16.292

<font> Lady . <$$font> What is to be done ? PLANCHE-1827-2,16.293

The baron's malady increases daily , in spite of every plan , every
exertion . PLANCHE-1827-2,16.294

My invention and my patience are alike exhausted .
PLANCHE-1827-2,16.295

If the storm would rise and burst , well and good ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,16.296

there might be some hope of the weather clearing ; PLANCHE-1827-2,16.297

but I am weary of seeing a cloud for ever on the horizon , which ,
despite its golden hues and fleecy softness , I know bears thunder in
its bosom . PLANCHE-1827-2,16.298

<font> Enter <$$font> Amelia , R. PLANCHE-1827-2,16.299

<font> Ame. <$$font> Oh , my dear aunt ! PLANCHE-1827-2,16.300

I am so pleased , and so <P_17> frightened ! PLANCHE-1827-2,17.301

Colonel Arnsdorf is here ; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.302

I saw him cross the lawn : PLANCHE-1827-2,17.303

what can he be come for ? PLANCHE-1827-2,17.304

<font> Lady . <$$font> To make a formal proposal , I hope , my love ,
to your guardian ; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.305

and would he had done so two years ago ! PLANCHE-1827-2,17.306

<font> Ame. <$$font> But you know , my dear aunt , that was impossible
; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.307

his father insisted on his marrying the only daughter of Count
Persenberg ; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.308

but the young lady has pleased herself , and eloped with her
music-master , PLANCHE-1827-2,17.309

and Frederick's hand is now as free as his heart is faithful .
PLANCHE-1827-2,17.310

<font> Lady . <$$font> <bracket> <font> Smiling . <$$font> <$$bracket>
And so , being perfectly aware of these circumstances , you wonder what
he can be come for ? PLANCHE-1827-2,17.311

But let me advise you , my dear Amelia , not to be too sanguine ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,17.312

I have strong fears that your uncle's consent will not be easily
obtained . PLANCHE-1827-2,17.313

<font> Ame. <$$font> Mercy on me ! PLANCHE-1827-2,17.314

why , what objection can he possibly make ? PLANCHE-1827-2,17.315

<font> Lady . <$$font> You know it was my poor sister's dying request ,
that , while we both lived , I should never suffer you , married or
single , to reside under another roof . PLANCHE-1827-2,17.316

Baron Speyhenhausen , as my husband and your guardian , pledged himself
to respect that injunction . PLANCHE-1827-2,17.317

If Colonel Arnsdorf , therefore , should become your husband , he must
inevitably reside with us . PLANCHE-1827-2,17.318

<font> Ame. <$$font> Well , and provided the colonel has no objection -
PLANCHE-1827-2,17.319

<font> Lady . <$$font> The baron has one , an insuperable one .
PLANCHE-1827-2,17.320

My dear Amelia , it is painful , humiliating to me , to enter into this
explanation ; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.321

but - you are aware of the baron's foible , his incurable , but secret
jealousy . PLANCHE-1827-2,17.322

Ever since that unlucky evening , when , having , with his usual
affectation of confidence , absolutely compelled us to go to the
Austrian minister's fancy-ball , he heard Colonel Arnsdorf followed our
carriage to the door of our mansion in Munich , Baron Speyenhausen has
persisted in the belief that I am the object of his pursuit ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,17.323

and all my endeavours to convince him of your mutual attachment he
obstinately considers as attempts to hoodwink him to the real state of
the case . PLANCHE-1827-2,17.324

<font> Ame. <$$font> But , surely , this open proposition of the
colonel's - <font> Lady . <$$font> Would convince anybody but Baron
Speyenhausen , PLANCHE-1827-2,17.325

and I sincerely hope it may him ; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.326

but jealousy has so distorted his perceptions , that I confess I should
not be surprised , if he saw nothing in that proposal , <P_18> but a
plan of the colonel's to establish himself , at any price , in the same
house with me . PLANCHE-1827-2,18.327

<font> Ame. <$$font> Ridiculous ! PLANCHE-1827-2,18.328

<font> Lady . <$$font> But too probable , as you may shortly have an
opportunity of assuring yourself . PLANCHE-1827-2,18.329

<bracket> <font> Goes up <$$font> C. PLANCHE-1827-2,18.330

<font> Ame. <$$font> What do I hear ! PLANCHE-1827-2,18.331

my uncle , with all his foolish fancies , can never be so absurd as to
imagine - PLANCHE-1827-2,18.332

or , mercy on me ! should it be true ! PLANCHE-1827-2,18.333

My aunt is still a young woman - a handsome woman ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,18.334

Frederick always spoke in raptures of her : PLANCHE-1827-2,18.335

can he be so false - so base - so - oh dear - oh dear !
PLANCHE-1827-2,18.336

Sure , jealousy@ @'s catching ; PLANCHE-1827-2,18.337

I begin to have such strange sensations - PLANCHE-1827-2,18.338

<font> Lady . <$$font> Here comes the baron again , and without the
colonel ; PLANCHE-1827-2,18.340

't@ @is as I feared , then . PLANCHE-1827-2,18.341

<font> Ame. <$$font> Without Frederick ! PLANCHE-1827-2,18.342

the plan was too obvious ; PLANCHE-1827-2,18.345

he saw I penetrated it , PLANCHE-1827-2,18.346

and retired in confusion ! PLANCHE-1827-2,18.347

Now will my wife put all sorts of questions to me to know the why and
the wherefore , PLANCHE-1827-2,18.348

but I@ @'ll disappoint her . PLANCHE-1827-2,18.349

<$$bracket> I dare not ! PLANCHE-1827-2,18.353

he would be sure to misconstrue my motives . PLANCHE-1827-2,18.354

<bracket> <font> Exit Lady Speyenhausen . <$$font>
PLANCHE-1827-2,18.355

<font> Ame. <$$font> Nay then , I@ @'ll go , and see if I can find him

Now , what can be more convincing ? PLANCHE-1827-2,18.359

But I@ @'ve got rid of him for ever , if he has any prudence or delicacy

<font> Col. <$$font> Yes : he gave me a patient hearing ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,19.382

professed his sincere sorrow at being obliged to refuse my request ;
PLANCHE-1827-2,19.383

assured me there was no mortal breathing he would be prouder to admit to
his family , but that he had , unfortunately , passed his word to
another , PLANCHE-1827-2,19.384

and therefore , painful as it was to him , he must request me to abandon
all thoughts of Amelia . PLANCHE-1827-2,19.385

<font> Col. <$$font> Vehemently ! PLANCHE-1827-2,19.388

Threw myself at his feet ; PLANCHE-1827-2,19.389

implored his pity ; PLANCHE-1827-2,19.390

started up again , PLANCHE-1827-2,19.391

<font> Col. <$$font> He fired up at that , PLANCHE-1827-2,19.396

and provoked me to tell him all my suspicions ; upon which he gulped
down his fury ; forced a laugh , at what he called my egregious mistake
, and begged me , of all things , to stay dinner .
PLANCHE-1827-2,19.397

I swore I would@ @n't stay another moment in the house ,
PLANCHE-1827-2,19.398

What can I do ? PLANCHE-1827-2,19.400

See her , I must , and will ; PLANCHE-1827-2,19.401

<font> Mar. <$$font> Humph ! Let me see - PLANCHE-1827-2,19.404

<font> Col. <$$font> Nothing ; PLANCHE-1827-2,20.428

it is directed to Amelia , PLANCHE-1827-2,20.429

, for the mere purpose of furthering his designs on the baroness .
PLANCHE-1827-2,20.443

But were I to consent ! PLANCHE-1827-2,20.448

- Say they were married , living under the same roof with my wife -
PLANCHE-1827-2,20.449

might not his affection cool for my niece , and his manners and person
gradually captivate the aunt , who is already but too much prepossessed

his pretended jealousy of his excellent wife is a mere mask , under

But it matters not what has inspired it . PLANCHE-1827-2,32.995

If such be the belief , it must be strangled in its birth .
