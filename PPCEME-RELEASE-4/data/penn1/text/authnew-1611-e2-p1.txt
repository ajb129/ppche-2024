1 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.7

Then Iesus , sixe dayes before the Passouer , came to Bethanie , where
Lazarus was , which had bene dead , whom hee raised from the dead .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.8

2 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.9

There they made him a supper , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.10

and Martha serued : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.11

but Lazarus was one of them y=t= sate at the table with him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.12

3 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.13

Then tooke Mary a pound of ointment , of Spikenard , very costly ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.14

and anointed the feet of Iesus , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.15

& wiped his feet with her haire : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.16

and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.17

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.18

Then saith one of his disciples , Iudas Iscariot , Simons sonne , which
should betray him , 5 Why was not this ointment sold for three_hundred
pence , and giuen to the poore ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.19

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.20

This he said , not that he cared for the poore : but because hee was a
thiefe , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.21

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.22

Then said Iesus , Let her alone , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.23

against the day of my burying hath she kept this .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.24

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.25

For the poore alwayes yee haue with you : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.26

but me ye haue not alwayes . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.27

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.28

Much people of the Iewes therefore knew that he was there :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.29

and they came , not for Iesus sake onely , but that they might see
Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.30

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.31

But the chiefe Priests consulted , y=t= they might put Lazarus also to
death , 11 Because that by reason of him many of the Iewes went away and
beleeued on Iesus . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.32

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.33

On the next day , much people that were come to the feast , when they
heard that Iesus was comming to Hierusalem , 13 Tooke branches of Palme
trees , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.34

and went foorth to meet him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.35

and cried , Hosanna , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.36

blessed is the king of Israel that co~meth in the Name of the Lord .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.37

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.38

And Iesus , when he had found a yong asse , sate thereon , as it is
written , 15 Feare not , daughter of Sion , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.39

behold , thy King commeth , sitting on an asses colt .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.40

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.41

These things vnderstood not his disciples at the first :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.42

but when Iesus was glorified , then reme~bred they that these things
were written of him , and that they had done these things vnto him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.43

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.44

The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his
graue , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.45

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.46

For this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that hee
had done this miracle . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.47

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.48

The Pharisees therefore saide among themselues , Perceiue ye how yee
preuaile nothing ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.49

Behold , the world is gone after him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,1J.50

<P_12,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.52

And there were certaine Greeks among them , that came vp to worship at
the feast : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.53

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.54

The same came therefore to Philip which <font> was <$$font> of Bethsaida
of Galilee , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.55

and desired him , saying , Sir , we would see Iesus .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.56

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.57

Philip commeth AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.58

and telleth Andrew : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.59

and againe Andrew and Philip told Iesus . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.60

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.61

And Iesus answered them , saying , The houre is come , that the Sonne of
man should be glorified . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.62

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.63

Verely , verely , I say vnto you , Except a corne of wheat fall into the
ground , and die , it abideth alone : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.64

but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.65

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.66

He that loueth his life , shall lose it : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.67

and hee that hateth his life in this world , shall keepe it vnto life
eternall . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.68

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.69

If any man serue me , let him follow me , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.70

and where I am , there shall also my seruant be :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.71

If any man serue me , him will my father honour .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.72

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.73

Now is my soule troubled , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.74

and what shall I say ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.75

Father , saue me from this houre , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.76

but for this cause came I vnto this houre .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.77

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.78

Father , glorifie thy Name . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.79

Then came there a voice from heauen , <font> saying <$$font> , I haue
both glorified it , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.80

and wil glorifie it againe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.81

29 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.82

The people therefore that stood by , and heard it , said , that it
thundered : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.83

others said , An Angel spake to him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.84

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.85

Iesus answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.86

and said , This voice came not because of mee , but for your sakes .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.87

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.88

Now is the iudgement of this world : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.89

now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.90

32 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.91

And I , if I be lifted vp from the earth , will draw all men vnto me .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.92

33 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.93

<paren> This hee said , signifying what death he should die <$$paren>
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.94

34 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.95

The people answered him , We haue heard out of the Law , that Christ
abideth for euer : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.96

and how sayest thou , The Sonne of man must bee lift vp ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.97

Who is this Sonne of man ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.98

35 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.99

Then Iesus said vnto them , Yet a little while is the light with you :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.100

walke while ye haue the light , lest darknesse come vpon you :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.101

For he that walketh in darkenesse , knoweth not whither he goeth .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.102

36 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.103

While ye haue light , beleeue in the light , that ye may bee the
children of light . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.104

These things spake Iesus , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.105

and departed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.106

and did hide himselfe from them . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.107

37 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.108

But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they beleeued
not on him : 38 That the saying of Esaias the Prophet might be fulfilled
, which hee spake , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.109

Lord , who hath beleeued our report ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.110

and to whom hath the arme of the Lord beene reuealed ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.111

39 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,20J.112

Therefore they could not beleeue , because that Esaias said againe ,
<P_12,40J> 40 He hath blinded their eyes , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.113

and hardned their heart , that they should not see with their eyes , nor
vnderstand with their heart , and be conuerted , and I should heale them
. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.114

41 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.115

These things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.116

42 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.117

Neuerthelesse , among the chiefe rulers also , many beleeued on him ;
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.118

but because of the Pharisees they did not confesse him , lest they
should be put out of the Synagogue . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.119

43 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.120

For they loued the praise of men , more then the praise of God .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.121

44 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.122

Iesus cried , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.123

and said , He that beleeueth on me , beleeueth not on me , but on him
that sent me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.124

45 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.125

And he that seeth me , seeth him that sent me .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.126

46 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.127

I am come a light into the world , that whosoeuer beleeueth on me ;
should not abide in darkenesse . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.128

47 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.129

And if any man heare my words and beleeue not , I iudge him not ;
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.130

For I came not to iudge the world , but to saue the world .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.131

48 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.132

He that reiecteth me , and receiueth not my words , hath one that
iudgeth him : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.133

y=e= word that I haue spoken ; the same shall iudge him in the last day
. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.134

49 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.135

For I haue not spoken of my selfe ; AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.136

but the Father which sent me , he gaue me a commaundement what I should
say , and what I should speake . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.137

50 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.138

And I know that his commandement is life euerlasting :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.139

whatsoeuer I speake therefore , euen as the Father said vnto me , so I
speake . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,12,40J.140

1 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.146

Now before the feast of the Passeouer , when Iesus knew that his houre
was come , that he should depart out of this world vnto the Father ,
hauing loued his owne which were in the world , he loued them vnto the
end . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.147

2 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.148

And supper being ended <paren> the deuill hauing now put into the heart
of Iudas Iscariot Simons sonne to betray him . <$$paren> 3 Iesus
knowing that the Father had giuen all things into his hands , and that
he was come from God , and went to God : 4 He riseth from supper ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.149

and layed aside his garments , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.150

and tooke a towell , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.151

and girded himselfe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.152

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.153

After that , he powreth water into a bason ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.154

and beganne to wash the disciples feete , and to wipe them with the
towell wherewith he was girded . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.155

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.156

Then commeth he to Simon Peter : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.157

and Peter saith vnto him , Lord , doest thou wash my feete ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.158

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.159

Iesus answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.160

and said vnto him , What I doe , thou knowest not now :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.161

but thou shalt know heereafter . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.162

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.163

Peter saith vnto him , Thou shalt neuer wash my feete .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.164

Iesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.165

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.166

Simon Peter saith vnto him , Lord , not my feete only , but also my
hands , and my head . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.167

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.168

Iesus saith to him , He that is washed , needeth not , saue to wash his
feet , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.169

but is cleane euery whit : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.170

and ye are cleane , but not all . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.171

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.172

For he knew who should betray him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.173

therefore said he , Ye are not all cleane .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.174

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.175

So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was
set downe againe , he said vnto them , Know ye what I haue done to you ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.176

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.177

Ye call me Master and Lord , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.178

and ye say well : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.179

for so I am . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.180

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.181

If I then your Lord and Master haue washed your feete , yee also ought
to wash one anothers feete . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.182

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.183

For I haue giuen you an example , that yee should doe , as I haue done
to you . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.184

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.185

Verily , verily I say vnto you , the seruant is not greater then his
lord , neither he that is sent , greater then hee that sent him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.186

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.187

If yee know these things , happy are ye if ye doe them .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.188

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.189

I speake not of you all , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.190

I know whom I haue chosen : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.191

but that the Scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with mee
, hath lift vp his heele against me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.192

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.193

Now I tell you before it come , that when it is come to passe , yee may
beleeue that I am he . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,1J.194

<P_13,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.196

Verily , verily I say vnto you , he that receiueth whomsoeuer I send ,
receiueth me : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.197

and he that receiueth me , receiueth him that sent me .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.198

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.199

When Iesus had thus sayd , hee was troubled in spirit ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.200

and testified , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.201

and said , Verily , verily I say vnto you , that one of you shall betray
me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.202

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.203

Then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom hee spake .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.204

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.205

Now there was leaning on Iesus bosome one of his disciples , whom Iesus
loued . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.206

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.207

Simon Peter therefore beckened to him , that he should aske who it
should be of whom he spake . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.208

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.209

Hee then lying on Iesus breast , saith vnto him , Lord , who is it ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.210

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.211

Iesus answered , Hee it is to whom I shall giue a soppe , when I haue
dipped it . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.212

And when he had dipped the sop , he gaue it to Iudas Iscariot the sonne
of Simon . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.213

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.214

And after the soppe , Satan entred into him ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.215

Then said Iesus vnto him , That thou doest , doe quickly .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.216

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.217

Now no man at the table knew , for what intent he spake this vnto him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.218

29 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.219

For some of them thought , because Iudas had the bagge , that Iesus had
sayd vnto him , Buy those things that wee haue need of against the feast
: or that he should giue some thing to the poore .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.220

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,13,20J.221

A woman , when she is in trauaile , hath sorrow , because her houre is

and speakest no prouerbe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,16,20J.539

and so did another disciple : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,1J.678

that disciple was knowen vnto the high Priest ,

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,1J.680

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,1J.681

But Peter stood at the doore without . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,1J.682

Then went out that other disciple , which was knowen vnto the high
Priest , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,1J.683

and spake vnto her that kept the doore , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,1J.684

He sayth , I am not . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,1J.688

and warmed himselfe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,1J.694

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,1J.695

The high Priest then asked Iesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine
. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,1J.696

<P_18,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.698

Iesus answered him , I spake openly to the world ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.699

I euer taught in the Synagogue , and in the Temple , whither the Iewes
alwayes resort , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.700

and in secret haue I said nothing : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.701

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.702

Why askest thou me ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.703

Aske them which heard me , what I haue said vnto them :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.704

behold , they know what I said . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.705

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.706

And when hee had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by ,
stroke Iesus with the palme of his hand , saying , Answerest thou the
hie priest so ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.707

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.708

Iesus answered him , If I haue spoken euill , beare witnesse of the
euill : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.709

but if well , why smitest thou me ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.710

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.711

Now Annas had sent him bound vnto Caiaphas the high Priest .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.712

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.713

And Simon Peter stood AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.714

and warmed himselfe : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.715

They said therefore vnto him , Art not thou also one of his disciples ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.716

Hee denied it , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.717

and said , I am not . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.718

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.719

One of the seruants of the high Priests <paren> being his kinsman whose

and immediatly the cocke crew . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.723

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.724

Then led they Iesus from Caiaphas vnto the hall of Iudgement :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.725

And it was earely , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.726

and they themselues went not into the Iudgement hall , lest they should

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.727

29 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.728

Pilate then went out vnto them , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.729

and said , What accusation bring you against this man ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.730

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.731

They answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.732

& said vnto him , If he were not a malefactor , we would not haue
deliuered him vp vnto thee . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.733

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.734

Then saide Pilate vnto them , Take ye him ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.735

and iudge him according to your law . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.736

The Iewes therefore said vnto him , It is not lawfull for vs to put any
man to death : 32 That the saying of Iesus might be fulfilled , which
hee spake , signifying what death he should die .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.737

33 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.738

Then Pilate entred into the Iudgement hall againe ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.739

and called Iesus , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.740

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.741

34 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.742

Iesus answered him , Sayest thou this thing of thy selfe ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.743

or did others tell it thee of me ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.744

35 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.745

Pilate answered , Am I a Iew ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.746

Thine owne nation , and the chiefe Priests haue deliuered thee vnto mee
: AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.747

What hast thou done ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.748

36 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.749

Iesus answered , My kingdome is not of this world :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.750

if my kingdome were of this world , then would my seruants fight , that
I should not be deliuered to the Iewes : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.751

but now is my kingdome not from hence . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.752

37 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.753

Pilate therefore saide vnto him , Art thou a King then ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.754

Iesus answered , Thou saiest that I am a King .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.755

To this end was I borne , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.756

and for this cause came I into the world , that I should beare witnesse
vnto the trueth : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.757

euery one that is of the trueth heareth my voice .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.758

38 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.759

Pilate saith vnto him , What is trueth ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.760

And when hee had said this , he went out againe vnto the Iewes ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.761

and saith vnto them , I find in him no fault at all .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.762

39 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,20J.763

But yee haue a custome that I should release vnto you one at the

<P_18,40J>

40 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,18,40J.767

Then cried they all againe , saying , Not this man , but Barabbas .

1 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.775

Then Pilate therfore tooke Iesus , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.776

and scourged him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.777

2 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.778

And the souldiers platted a crowne of thornes ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.779

and put it on his head , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.780

and they put on him a purple robe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.781

3 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.782

And said , Haile king of the Iewes : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.783

and they smote him with their hands . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.784

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.785

Pilate therefore went foorth againe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.786

and saith vnto them , Behold , I bring him foorth to you , that yee may
know that I find no fault in him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.787

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.788

Then came Iesus forth , wearing the crowne of thornes , and the purple
robe : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.789

and <font> Pilate <$$font> saith vnto them , Behold the man .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.790

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.791

When the chiefe Priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out
, saying , Crucifie him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.792

crucifie him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.793

Pilate saith vnto them , Take ye him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.794

and crucifie him : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.795

for I find no fault in him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.796

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.797

The Iewes answered him , We haue a law , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.798

and by our law he ought to die , because hee made himselfe the Son of
God . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.799

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.800

When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.801

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.802

And went againe into the iudgement hall , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.803

& saith vnto Iesus , Whence art thou ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.804

But Iesus gaue him no answere . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.805

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.806

Then saith Pilate vnto him , Speakest thou not vnto me ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.807

Knowest thou not , that I haue power to crucifie thee , and haue power
to release thee ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.808

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.809

Iesus answered , Thou couldest haue no power at all against me , except
it were giuen thee from aboue : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.810

therfore he that deliuered me vnto thee , hath the greater sinne .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.811

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.812

And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.813

but the Iewes cried out , saying , If thou let this man goe , thou art
not Cesars friend : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.814

whosoeuer maketh himselfe a king , speaketh against Cesar .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.815

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.816

When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Iesus foorth ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.817

and sate downe in the iudgement seate , in a place that is called the
pauement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.818

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.819

And it was the preparation of the Passeouer , and , about the sixt houre
: AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.820

and he saith vnto the Iewes , Beholde your King .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.821

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.822

But they cried out , Away with him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.823

away with him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.824

crucifie him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.825

Pilate saith vnto them , Shall I crucifie your King ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.826

The chiefe Priests answered , Wee haue no king but Cesar .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.827

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.828

Then deliuered he him therfore vnto them to be crucified :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.829

and they took Iesus , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.830

and led him away . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.831

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.832

And he bearing his crosse , went foorth into a place called the place of
a skull , which is called in the Hebrewe , Golgotha : 18 Where they
crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Iesus
in the middest . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.833

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.834

And Pilate wrote a title , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.835

and put it on the crosse . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.836

And the writing was , IESVS OF NAZARETH , THE KING OF THE IEWES .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,1J.837

<P_19,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.839

This title then read many of the Iewes : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.840

for the place where Iesus was crucified , was nigh to the citie ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.841

and it was written in Hebrewe , and Greeke , and Latine .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.842

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.843

Then said the chiefe Priests of the Iewes to Pilate , Write not , The
king of the Iewes : but that he said , I am King of the Iewes .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.844

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.845

Pilate answered , What I haue written , I haue written .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.846

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.847

Then the souldiers , when they had crucified Iesus , tooke his garments
, <paren> and made foure parts , to euery souldier a part <$$paren> and
also his coat : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.848

Now the coate was without seame , wouen from the top thorowout .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.849

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.850

They said therefore among themselues , Let not vs rent it , but cast
lots for it , whose it shall bee : that the Scripture might bee
fulfilled , which saith , They parted my raiment among them ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.851

and for my vesture they did cast lots . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.852

These things therefore the souldiers did .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.853

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.854

Now there stood by the crosse of Iesus , his mother , and his mothers
sister , Mary <font> the wife <$$font> of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene
. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.855

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.856

When Iesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by ,
whom he loued , he saith vnto his mother , Woman , behold thy sonne .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.857

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.858

Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.859

And from that houre that disciple tooke her vnto his owne home .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.860

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.861

After this , Iesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that
the Scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.862

29 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.863

Now there was set a vessell , full of vineger :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.864

And they filled a spunge with vineger , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.865

and put it vpon hyssope , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.866

and put it to his mouth . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.867

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.868

When Iesus therefore had receiued the vineger , he said , It is finished
, AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.869

and he bowed his head , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.870

and gaue vp the ghost . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.871

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.872

The Iewes therefore , because it was the preparation ; that the bodies
should not remaine vpon the Crosse on the Sabbath day <paren> for that
Sabbath day was an high day <$$paren> besought Pilate that their legs
might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.873

32 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.874

Then came the souldiers , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.875

and brake the legs of the first , and of the other , which was crucified
with him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.876

33 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.877

But when they came to Iesus , and saw that he was dead already , they
brake not his legs . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.878

34 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.879

But one of the souldiers with a speare pierced his side ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.880

and forthwith came there out blood and water .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.881

And he that saw it , bare record , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.883

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.885

36 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.886

For these things were done , that the Scripture should be fulfilled , A
bone of him shall not be broken . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.887

37 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.888

38 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,19,20J.890

And after this , Ioseph of Arimathea , he <paren> being a disciple of

The first day of the weeke , commeth Mary Magdalene earely when it was

and seeth the stone taken away from the Sepulchre .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.913

2 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.914

Then she runneth AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.915

and commeth to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple whom Iesus loued
, AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.916

and saith vnto them , They haue taken away the Lord out of the Sepulchre
, AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.917

and we know not where they haue laid him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.918

3 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.919

Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.920

and came to the Sepulchre . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.921

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.922

So they ranne both together , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.923

and the other disciple did outrun Peter , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.924

and came first to the Sepulchre . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.925

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.926

And he stouping downe and looking in , saw the linnen clothes lying ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.927

yet went he not in . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.928

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.929

Then commeth Simon Peter following him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.930

and went into the Sepulchre , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.931

and seeth the linnen clothes lie , 7 And the napkin that was about his
head , not lying with the linnen clothes , but wrapped together in a
place by it selfe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.932

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.933

Then went in also that other disciple which came first to the Sepulchre
, AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.934

and he saw , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.935

and beleeued . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.936

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.937

For as yet they knew not the Scripture , that hee must rise againe from
the dead . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.938

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.939

Then the disciples went away againe vnto their owne home .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.940

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.941

But Mary stood without at the sepulchre , weeping :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.942

& as shee wept , she stouped downe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.943

and looked into the Sepulchre , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.944

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.945

And seeth two Angels in white , sitting , the one at the head , and the
other at the feete , where the body of Iesus had layen :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.946

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.947

And they say vnto her , Woman , why weepest thou ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.948

Shee saith vnto them , Because they haue taken away my Lord ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.949

and I know not where they haue laied him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.950

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.951

And when she had thus said , she turned herselfe backe ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.952

and saw Iesus standing , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.953

and knew not that it was Iesus . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.954

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.955

Iesus saith vnto her , Woman , why weepest thou ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.956

whom seekest thou ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.957

She supposing him to be the gardiner , saith vnto him , Sir , if thou
haue borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laied him ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.958

and I will take him away . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.959

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.960

Iesus saith vnto her , Mary . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.961

She turned herselfe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.962

and saith vnto him , Rabboni , which is to say , Master .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.963

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.964

Iesus saith vnto her , Touch me not : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.965

for I am not yet ascended to my Father : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.966

but goe to my brethren , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.967

and say vnto them , I ascend vnto my Father , and your Father , and to
my God , and your God . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.968

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.969

Mary Magdalene came AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.970

and told the disciples that shee had seene the Lord , and that hee had
spoken these things vnto her . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.971

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.972

Then the same day at euening , being the first day of the weeke , when
the doores were shut , where the disciples were assembled for feare of
the Iewes , came Iesus , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.973

and stood in the midst , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.974

and saith vnto them , Peace bee vnto you . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,1J.975

<P_20,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.977

And when hee had so saide , hee shewed vnto them his hands and his side
. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.978

Then were the disciples glad , when they saw the Lord .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.979

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.980

Then said Iesus to them againe , Peace be vnto you :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.981

As my Father hath sent me , euen so send I you .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.982

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.983

And when he had said this , hee breathed on them ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.984

and saith vnto them , Receiue ye the holy Ghost .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.985

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.986

Whose soeuer sinnes yee remit , they are remitted vnto them ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.987

and whose soeuer sinnes yee retaine , they are retained .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.988

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.989

But Thomas one of the twelue , called Didymus , was not with them when
Iesus came . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.990

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.991

The other disciples therefore said vnto him , We haue seene the Lord .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.992

But he said vnto them , Except I shall see in his hands the print of the
nailes , and put my finger into the print of the nailes , and thrust my
hand into his side , I will not beleeue . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.993

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.994

And after eight dayes , againe his disciples were within , and Thomas
with them : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.995

<font> Then <$$font> came Iesus , the doores being shut ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.996

and said , Peace be vnto you . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.998

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.999

Then saith he to Thomas , Reach hither thy finger ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1000

and beholde my hands , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1001

and reach hither thy hand , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1002

and thrust it into my side , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1003

and bee not faithlesse , but beleeuing . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1004

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1005

And Thomas answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1006

and said vnto him , My Lord , and my God .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1007

29 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1008

Iesus saith vnto him , Thomas , because thou hast seene mee , thou hast
beleeued : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1009

blessed are they that haue not seene , and yet haue beleeued .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1010

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1011

And many other signes truely did Iesus in the presence of his disciples
, which are not written in this booke : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1012

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,20,20J.1013

After these things Iesus shewed himselfe againe to the disciples at the
sea of Tiberias , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1021

and on this wise shewed he himselfe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1022

2 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1023

There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and
Nathaneel of Cana in Galilee , and the sonnes of Zebedee , and two other
of his disciples . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1024

3 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1025

Simon Peter saith vnto them , I goe a fishing .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1026

They say vnto him , Wee also goe with thee .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1027

They went foorth AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1028

and entred into a ship immediatly , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1029

and that night they caught nothing . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1030

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1031

But when the morning was now come , Iesus stood on the shore :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1032

but the disciples knewe not that it was Iesus .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1033

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1034

Then Iesus saith vnto them , Children , haue ye any meat ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1035

They answered him , No . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1036

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1037

And he said vnto them , Cast the net on the right side of the ship , and
yee shall finde . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1038

They cast therfore , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1039

and now they were not able to draw it , for the multitude of fishes .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1040

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1041

Therefore that Disciple whome Iesus loued , saith vnto Peter , It is the
Lord . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1042

Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his fishers
coate vnto him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1043

<paren> for hee was naked <$$paren> AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1044

& did cast himselfe into the sea . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1045

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1046

And the other disciples came in a litle ship <paren> for they were not
farre from land , but as it were two_hundred cubites <$$paren> dragging
the net with fishes . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1047

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1048

As@ @soone then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of coales
there , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1049

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1050

Iesus saith vnto them , Bring of the fish , which ye haue now caught .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1051

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1052

Simon Peter went vp , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1053

& drewe the net to land full of great fishes ,
an_hundred_and_fiftie_and_three : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1054

and for all there were so many , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1055

yet was not the net broken . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1056

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1057

Iesus saith vnto them , Come , and dine . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1058

And none of the disciples durst aske him , Who art thou ? knowing that
it was the Lord . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1059

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1060

Iesus then commeth , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1061

and taketh bread , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1062

and giueth them , and fish likewise . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1063

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1064

This is nowe the third time that Iesus shewed himselfe to his disciples
, after that hee was risen from the dead .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1065

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1066

So when they had dined , Iesus saith to Simon Peter , Simon , sonne of
Ionas , louest thou mee more then these ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1067

He saith vnto him , Yea , Lord , thou knowest that I loue thee .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1068

He saith vnto him , Feed my lambes . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1069

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1070

He saith to him againe the second time , Simon sonne of Ionas , louest
thou me ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1071

He saith vnto him , Yea Lord , thou knowest that I loue thee .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1072

He saith vnto him , Feed my sheepe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1073

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1074

He said vnto him the third time , Simon sonne of Ionas , louest thou mee
? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1075

Peter was grieued , because hee saide vnto him the third time , Louest
thou me ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1076

And he said vnto him , Lord , thou knowest all things ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1077

thou knowest that I loue thee . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1078

Iesus sayth vnto him , Feed my sheepe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1079

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1080

Verily , verily I say vnto thee , whe~ thou wast yong , thou girdedst
thy selfe , and walkedst whither thou wouldest :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1081

but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1082

and another shall gird thee , and carie thee whither thou wouldest not .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1083

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1084

This spake hee , signifying by what death he should glorifie God .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1085

And when he had spoken this , he sayth vnto him , Follow me .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,1J.1086

<P_21,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1088

Then Peter turning about , seeth the Disciple whom Iesus loued ,
following , which also leaned on his breast at supper , and said , Lord
, which is hee that betraieth thee ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1089

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1090

Peter seeing him , saith to Iesus , Lord , and what shall this man
<font> doe <$$font> ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1091

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1092

Iesus saith vnto him , If I will that he tary till I come , what is that
to thee ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1093

Follow thou me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1094

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1095

Then went this saying abroad among the brethren , that that Disciple
should not die : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1096

yet Iesus sayd not vnto him , He shall not die : but , If I will that he
tary till I come , what is that to thee ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1097

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1098

This is the Disciple which testifieth of these things , and wrote these
things , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1099

and we know that his testimonie is true .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1100

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,21,20J.1101

And there are also many other things which Iesus did , the which if they
should be written euery one , I suppose that euen the world it selfe
could not conteine the bookes that should be written ,

The former treatise haue I made , O Theophilus , of al that Iesus began

after that he through the holy Ghost had giuen commaundements vnto the
Apostles , whom he had chosen . 3 To whom also he shewed himselfe aliue

And as they spake vnto the people , the Priests and the captaine of the
Temple , and the Sadduces came vpon them , 2 Being grieued that they
taught the people , and preached through Iesus the resurrection from the
dead . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1343

3 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1344

And they laid hands on them , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1345

and put them in hold vnto the next day : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1346

for it was now euentide . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1347

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1348

Howbeit , many of them which heard the word , beleeued ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1349

and the number of the men was about fiue_thousand .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1350

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1351

And it came to passe on the morow , that their rulers , and Elders , and
Scribes , 6 And Annas the high Priest , and Caiphas , and Iohn , and
Alexander , and as many as were of the kinred of the high Priest , were
gathered together at Hierusalem . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1352

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1353

And when they had set them in the middest , they asked , By what power ,
or by what name haue ye done this ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1354

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1355

Then Peter filled with the holy Ghost , said vnto them , Ye rulers of
the people , and Elders of Israel , 9 If we this day be examined of the
good deed done to the impotent man , by what meanes he is made whole ,
10 Be it knowen vnto you all , and to all the people of Israel , that by
the Name of Iesus Christ of Nazareth , whom ye crucified , whome God
raised from the dead , euen by him , doeth this man stand here before
you , whole . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1356

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1357

This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders , which is
become the head of the corner . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1358

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1359

Neither is there saluation in any other : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1360

for there is none other name vnder heauen giuen among men whereby we
must be saued . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1361

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1362

Now when they sawe the boldnesse of Peter and Iohn , and perceiued that
they were vnlearned and ignorant men , they marueiled ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1363

and they tooke knowledge of them , that they had bene with Iesus .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1364

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1365

And beholding the man which was healed , standing with them , they could
say nothing against it . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1366

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1367

But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the Council , they
conferred among themselues , 16 Saying , What shall we do to these men ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1368

for that indeed a notable miracle hath bene done by them , is manifest
to all them that dwell in Hierusalem , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1369

and we can@ @not denie it . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1370

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1371

But that it spread no farther among the people , let vs straitly
threaten them , that they speake henceforth to no man in this Name .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1372

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1373

And they called them , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1374

and commanded them , not to speake at all , nor teach in the Name of
Iesus . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1375

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1376

But Peter and Iohn answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1377

and said vnto them , Whether it be right in the sight of God , to
hearken vnto you more then {it_is_right_to_hearken} vnto God , iudge ye
. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,1A.1378

<P_4,20A>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1380

For wee can@ @not but speake the things which we haue seene and heard .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1381

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1382

So when they had further threatned them , they let them goe , finding
nothing how they might punish them , because of the people :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1383

for all men glorified God for that which was done .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1384

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1385

For the man was aboue fourtie yeeres olde , on whome this miracle of
healing was shewed . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1386

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1387

And being let goe , they went to their owne company ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1388

and reported all that the chiefe Priests and Elders had said vnto them .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1389

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1390

And when they heard that , they lift vp their voyce to God with one
accord , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1391

& said , Lord , thou art God which hast made heauen and earth , and the
sea , and all that in them is , 25 Who by the mouth of thy seruant Dauid
hast saide , Why did the heathen rage , and the people imagine vaine
things ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1392

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1393

The Kings of the earth stood vp , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1394

and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord , & against his
Christ . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1395

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1396

For of a trueth against thy holy child Iesus , whom thou hast anointed ,
both Herod , and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles , and the people of
Israel were gathered together , 28 For to doe whatsoeuer thy hand and
thy counsell determined before to be done .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1397

29 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1398

And now Lord , behold their threatnings , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1399

and graunt vnto thy seruants , that with all boldnesse they may speake
thy word , 30 By stretching foorth thine hand to heale : and that signes

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1400

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1401

And when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were
assembled together , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1402

and they were all filled with the holy Ghost ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1403

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1404

32 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1405

And the multitude of them that beleeued , were of one heart , and of one
soule : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1406

Neither said any of them , that ought of the things which he possessed ,

but they had all things common . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1408

Neither was there any among them that lacked :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1413

For as many as were possessors of lands , or houses , sold them ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,4,20A.1414

And when they had brought them , they set them before the Councill ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,5,20A.1509

and the high Priest asked them , 28 Saying , Did not wee straitly
command you , that you should not teach in this Name ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-P1,5,20A.1510

And behold , yee haue filled Hierusalem with your doctrine ,
