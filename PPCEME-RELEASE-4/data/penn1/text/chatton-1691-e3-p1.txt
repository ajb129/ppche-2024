My L=d= , Some of my old botanick acquaintances , having made an
appointm=t= to goe yesterday to Hampton Court <paren> to see y=e= famous
collection ther of y=e= rare Indian plantes w=ch= mine Heer Fagel had
gathered together <$$paren> , called on me , CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,148.5

and I heartily wish'd y=r= Lo=ppe= had been ther ,
CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,148.6

for there is about 400 rare Indian plantes w=ch= were never seen in
England ; CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,148.7

and there is scarce any desirable Indian plant , but a specimen may be
seen there ; CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,148.8

and some very curious Indian plants are in so great perfection y=t= it
is very wonderfull and scarce credible . CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,148.9

The stoves in w=ch= they are kept are much better contrived and built
then any other in England . CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,148.10

Wee went by water CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,148.11

and called at a D=rs= house by y=e= way , wher I saw a very pretty
floewring shrubb in his greenhouse , CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,148.12

and I have enclosed 2 or 3 seeds , all I cou'd get ;
CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,148.13

and if carefully sowed on a hotbed , I doubt not but they will come up .
CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,148.14

The greatest news I can send you from here is y=t= y=e= Abjuration
<P_2,149> Bill is flung out of y=e= House of Commons , at w=ch= , it is
said , some are soe displeased y=t= ther will be another bill brought in
much to y=e= same effect . CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,149.15

My L=d= Nottingham@ @'s abdication is now contradicted by y=e=
coffeehouse newsmongers . CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,149.16

Wee are all here both to y=r= Lo=ppe= and all at Kirby most faithfull
and very humble servants . CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,149.17

Wee are likely to have here great bussle betwixt y=e= Wiggs and modern
Tories , CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,149.21

for y=e= Lords have passed y=e= bill for invalidating y=e= judgm=t=
ag=t= y=e= charter of London and restoring y=e= old charter , by w=ch=
all y=e= old aldermen and magistrates of London , who were displaced
when y=e= charter of London wase judg'd forfeited , are restored ,
CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,149.22

and all vacancies since <paren> by the 26 of this month <$$paren> are by
new elections to be filled up ; so y=t= by y=e= 26=th= a new L=d= Mayor
, new sheriffs , severall new aldermen , a new common councell , are to
be chosen , w=ch= you will easily imagine will occasion warm disputes .
CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,149.23

Yesterday S=r= Ed. Seymour in y=e= H. of Commons tooke occasion to
fall a little foul upon y=e= white marquise ,
CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,149.24

and wase seconded by Capt=n= Granville , my L=d= Bath@ @s son .
CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,149.25

In return , some friends to the {COM:preceding_word_"the"_emended}
Marquise made some sever reflections on y=e= Earle of Bath ,
CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,149.26

and , after some wrangling , y=e= business fell ,
CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,149.27

and y=e= Marquises and Earle's honour <paren> notwithstanding all
reflections <$$paren> are in statu quo . CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,149.28

I hope , my L=d= , it wase not any increase of y=r= indisposition w=ch=
wase y=e= occasion I heard nothing from Kirby y=e= last post .
CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,150.33

And , tho' I have not much news to acquaint y=r= Lo=ppe= , yet I will
send w=t= I heare stirring , CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,150.34

and in y=e= first place tell you w=t= will be more surprising then
afflicting to you . CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,150.35

The famed Ferguson is committed to a messenger's hand on suspition of
treason ag=t= y=e= present governm=t= . CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,150.36

This day Capt=n= Crone wase y=e= 3=d= time tryed and found guilty of

of y=e= clocke yesterday in y=e= afternoone till one this afternoone ,
after w=ch= in arrest of judgm=t= he pleaded an errour in y=e=
indictm=t= as found by y=e= grand jury , CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,150.38

for they signed it Billa Verra ; CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,150.39

Windsor or Audle-End , because y=e= Papists , on pretence of going to

The truth is , y=e= popish party are very insolent and impudently give
y=e= ly to all other publick news , CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,150.42

run down , y=t= y=e= popish party give out y=t= they are
{COM:preceding_word_"are"_emended} very strong and have lately received
great recruits from Ireland . CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,150.43

Wee shall never be happy till all our damnable lyers are confounded ,
w=ch= God speedily grant . CHATTON-1691-E3-P1,2,150.44
