Cossin Plumpton , I hartely recommend me unto you , thanking you for all

and if ye had so thought , I wold have confeined myselfe to you .
SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.73

But I perceive the parte is not minded to commone with him ;
SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.74

his wife thinks him to light . SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.75

And I think , consider his qualeties , his living , his posabilete ,
SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.76

And I am sur ther haith bene comredis won with other far wars then he ,

And as for that , ther is and haith bene many good men with that faut ;
SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.80

it is the thing that he can@ @not amend . SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.81

It lets him not to eat , drink , slepe ; SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.82

he can live as well of it I have given him , as though it had desendit
to him . SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.83

And if his brother dy without isew , in all by gift he shall have
v_hundreth mark land , SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.84

<paren> and if he wear but inhiretable by the law , he shold be heir to
him , SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.85

but for defaut of heireship , I thinke he will not change his estate in
this case ; <$$paren> SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.86

and for defaute of heires of my body lawfuly begotten , he shall inhirit
all that I have . SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.87

But in the meane onely , his fault so shall not hirt him in no profets .
SAVILL-1545-E1-P1,249.88
