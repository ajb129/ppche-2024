<P_1,213>

And the more to disable and deprive the King of his Crown , and to
confirm the said <font> Cobham <$$font> in his Intents , <font> Raleigh
<$$font> did publish a Book , falsly written against the most Just and
Royal Title of the King , knowing the said Book to be written against
the just Title of the King ; which Book <font> Cobham <$$font> after
that received of him . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.3

Further , for the better effecting these traitorous Purposes , and to
establish the said <font> Brook <$$font> in his Intent , the said <font>
Cobham <$$font> did deliver the said Book unto him the 14th of <font>
June <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.4

And further , the said <font> Cobham <$$font> , on the 16th of <font>
June <$$font> , for Accomplishment of the said Conference , and by the
traitorous Instigation of <font> Raleigh <$$font> , did move <font>
Brook <$$font> to incite <font> Arabella <$$font> to write to the three
forenamed Princes , to procure them to advance her Title ; and that she
, after she had obtained the Crown , should promise to perform three
Things , <font> viz. <$$font> 1. Peace between <font> England <$$font>
and <font> Spain <$$font> . 2. To tolerate with Impunity the Popish
and Roman Superstitions . 3. To be ruled by them three in the
contracting of her Marriage . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.5

To these Motions the said <font> Brook <$$font> gave his Assent .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.6

And for the better effecting of the said Treasons , <font> Cobham
<$$font> on the 17th of <font> June <$$font> , by the Instigation of
<font> Raleigh <$$font> , did write Letters to Count <font> Aremberg
<$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.7

and did deliver the said Letters to one <font> Matthew de Lawrency
<$$font> , to be delivered to the said Count , which he did deliver ,
for the obtaining of the 600,000 Crowns ; which Money by other Letters
Count <font> Aremberg <$$font> did promise to perform the Payment of ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.8

and this Letter <font> Cobham <$$font> received the 18th of <font> June
<$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.9

And then did <font> Cobham <$$font> promise to <font> Raleigh <$$font> ,
that when he had received the said Money , he would deliver 8000 Crowns
to him , to which Motion he did consent ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.10

and afterwards <font> Cobham <$$font> offered <font> Brook <$$font> ,
that after he should receive the said Crowns , he would give to him
10,000 thereof ; to which Motion <font> Brook <$$font> did assent .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.11

To the Indictment , Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> pleaded Not
Guilty . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.12

The Jury . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.13

Sir <font> Ralph Conisby <$$font> , Sir <font> Edward Peacock <$$font> ,
Sir <font> Thomas Fowler <$$font> , Sir <font> William Rowe <$$font> ,
Knights . <font> Henry Goodyer <$$font> , <font> Roger Wood <$$font> ,
<font> Thomas Walker <$$font> , <font> Thomas Whitby <$$font> , Esquires
. <font> Thomas Highgate <$$font> , <paren> John Chawkey <$$font> ,
<font> Robert Kempton <$$font> , <font> Robert Bromley <$$font> ,
Gentlemen . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.14

Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> , Prisoner , was asked , Whether he
would take exceptions to any of the Jury ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.15

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . I know none of them ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.16

they are all Christians , and honest Gentlemen ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.17

I except against none . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.18

E. <font> Suffolk <$$font> . You Gentlemen of the King's Learned
Counsel , follow the same course as you did the other day .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.19

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . My Lord , I pray you I may answer the Points
particularly as they are delivered , by reason of the Weakness of my
Memory and Sickness . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.20

<font> L. C. Just. Popham <$$font> . After the King's Learned
Council have delivered all the Evidence , Sir <font> Walter <$$font> ,
you may answer particularly to what you will .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.21

<font> Heale , the King's Serjeant at Law <$$font> . You have heard of
<font> Raleigh <$$font> 's bloody attempts to kill the King and his
Royal Progeny , and in place thereof , to advance one <font> Arabella
Stuart <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.22

The Particulars of the Indictment are these :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.23

First , that <font> Raleigh <$$font> met with <font> Cobham <$$font> the
9th of <font> June <$$font> , and had Conference of an Invasion , of a
Rebellion , and an Insurrection , to be made by the King's Subjects , to
depose the King , and to kill his Children , poor Babes that never gave
Offence . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.24

Here is Blood , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.25

here is a new King and Governor . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.26

In our King consists all our Happiness , and the true Use of the Gospel
; a thing which we all wish to be settled , after the Death of the Queen
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.27

Here must be Money to do this , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.28

for Money is the Sinew of War . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.29

Where should that be had ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.30

Count <font> Aremberg <$$font> must procure it of <font> Philip <$$font>
King of <font> Spain <$$font> , five or six_Hundred_Thousand Crowns ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.31

and out of this Sum <font> Raleigh <$$font> must have Eight_Thousand .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.32

But what is that Count <font> Aremberg ? <$$font>
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.33

Though I am no good <font> Frenchman <$$font> , yet it is as much as
{it_would_be} to say in <font> English <$$font> , Earl of <font>
Aremberg <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.34

Then there must be Friends to effect this : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.35

<font> Cobham <$$font> must go to <font> Albert <$$font> Archduke of
<font> Austria <$$font> , for whom <font> Aremberg <$$font> was
Embassador at that time in <font> England <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.36

And what then ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.37

He must persuade the Duke to assist the pretended Title of <font>
Arabella <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.38

From thence <font> Cobham <$$font> must go to the King of <font> Spain
<$$font> , and persuade him to assist the said Title .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.39

Since the Conquest , there was never the like Treason .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.40

But out of whose Head came it ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.41

Out of <font> Raleigh <$$font> 's , who must also advise <font> Cobham
<$$font> to use his Brother <font> Brook <$$font> to incite the Lady
<font> Arabella <$$font> to write three several Letters , as aforesaid
in the Indictment : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.42

all this was on the 9th of <font> June <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.43

Then three Days after , <font> Brook <$$font> was acquainted with it .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.44

After this , <font> Cobham <$$font> said to <font> Brook <$$font> , It
will never be well in <font> England <$$font> , till the King and his
Cubs are taken away . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.45

Afterwards , <font> Raleigh <$$font> delivered a Book to <font> Cobham
<$$font> , treacherously written against the Title of the King .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.46

It appears that <font> Cobham <$$font> took <font> Raleigh <$$font> to
be either a God , or an Idol . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.47

<font> Cobham <$$font> endeavours to set up a new King , or Governor :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.48

God forbid mine Eyes should ever see so unhappy a Change .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.49

As for the Lady <font> Arabella <$$font> , she , upon my Conscience ,
hath no more Title to the Crown than {SIC:that} I have , which before
God I utterly renounce . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.50

<font> Cobham <$$font> , a Man bred in <font> England <$$font> , hath no
{SIC:on} Experience abroad ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.51

but <font> Raleigh <$$font> , a Man of great Wit , Military , and a
Sword-Man . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.52

Now whether these things were bred in a hollow Tree , I leave to them to
speak of , who can speak far better than myself .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.53

<font> And so sat him down again <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,213.54

<P_1,214>

<font> Sir Ed. Coke , the King's Attorney <$$font> . I must first , my
Lords , before I come to the Cause , give one Caution , because we shall
often mention Persons of eminent Places , some of them great Monarchs :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.56

Whatever we say of them we shall but repeat what others have said of
them ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.57

I mean the Capital Offenders in their Confessions .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.58

We professing Law , must speak reverently of Kings and Potentates .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.59

I perceive these honourable Lords , and the rest of this great Assembly
, are come to hear what hath been scattered upon the Wrack of Report .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.60

We carry a just Mind , to condemn no Man , but upon plain Evidence ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.61

Here is Mischief , Mischief <font> in summo gradu <$$font> , exorbitant
Mischief . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.62

My Speech shall chiefly touch these three Points ; <font> Imitation
<$$font> , <font> Supportation <$$font> , and <font> Defence <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.63

The Imitation of Evil ever exceeds the Precedent ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.64

as on the contrary , Imitation of Good ever comes short .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.65

Mischief can@ @not be supported but by Mischief ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.66

yea , it will so multiply , that it will bring all to Confusion .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.67

Mischief is ever underprop'd by Falshood or foul Practices :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.68

and because all these things did concur in this Treason , you shall
understand the Main , as before you did the Bye .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.69

The Treason of the Bye consisteth in these Points :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.70

First , that the Lord <font> Grey <$$font> , <font> Brook <$$font> ,
<font> Markham <$$font> , and the rest , intended by Force in the Night
to surprize the King's Court ; which was a Rebellion in the Heart of the
Realm , yea , in the Heart of the Heart , in the Court .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.71

They intended to take him that is a Sovereign , to make him subject to
their Power . Purposing to open the Doors with Musquets and Caliveers ,
and to take also the Prince and Council : then under the King's
Authority to carry the King to the Tower ; and to make a Stale of the
Admiral . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.72

When they had the King there , to extort three things from him : First ,
A Pardon for all their Treasons : Secondly , A Toleration of the Roman
Superstition ; which their Eyes shall sooner fall out than they shall
ever see ; for the King hath spoken these Words in the hearing of many ,
<font> I will lose the Crown and my Life , before ever I will alter
Religion <$$font> . And , Thirdly To remove Counsellors .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.73

In the room of the Lord Chancellor , they would have placed one <font>
Watson <$$font> a Priest , absurd in Humanity and ignorant in Divinity .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.74

<font> Brook <$$font> , of whom I will speak nothing , Lord Treasurer .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.75

The great Secretary must be <font> Markham <$$font> ; <font> Oculus
Patriae <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.76

A Hole must be found in milord Chief Justice@ @'s Coat .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.77

<font> Grey <$$font> must be Earl-Marshall , and Master of the Horse ,
because he would have a Table in the Court ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.78

marry , he would advance the Earl of <font> Worcester <$$font> to a
higher Place . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.79

All this can@ @not be done without a Multitude :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.80

Therefore <font> Watson <$$font> the Priest tells a resolute Man , that
the King was in Danger of <font> Puritans <$$font> and <font> Jesuits
<$$font> ; so to bring him in blindfold into the Action , saying , That
the King is no King till he be crown'd ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.81

therefore every Man might right his own Wrongs :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.82

But he is <font> Rex natus <$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.83

his Dignity descends as well as yours , my Lords .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.84

Then <font> Watson <$$font> imposeth a blasphemous Oath , that they
should Swear to defend the King's Person ; to keep secret what was given
them in charge , and seek all Ways and Means to advance the Catholick
Religion . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.85

Then they intend to send for the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen , in the
King's Name , to the Tower , lest they should make any Resistance , and
then to take Hostages of them ; and to enjoin them to provide for them
Victuals and Munition . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.86

<font> Grey <$$font> , because the King removed before <font> Midsummer
<$$font> , had a further Reach , to get a Company of Swordmen to assist
the Action : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.87

Therefore he would stay till he had obtained a Regiment from <font>
Ostend <$$font> or <font> Austria <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.88

So you see the Treason were like <font> Sampson <$$font> 's Foxes ,
which were joined in their Tails , tho' their Heads were sever'd .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.89

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . You Gentlemen of the Jury , I pray remember ,
I am not charged with the Bye , being the Treason of the Priest .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.90

<font> Attorney . <$$font> You are not . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.91

My Lords , you shall observe three things in the Treasons :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.92

First , they had a Watch-word , <paren> the King's Safety <$$paren> ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.93

their Pretence was <font> Bonum in se <$$font> ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.94

their Intent was <font> Malum in se <$$font> ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.95

Secondly , they avouched Scripture ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.96

both the Priests had <font> Scriptum est <$$font> ; perverting and
ignorantly mistaking the Scriptures : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.97

Thirdly , They avouch'd the Common Law , to prove that he was no King
'till he was crowned ; alledging a Statute of 13 <font> Eliz. <$$font>
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.98

This , by way of Imitation , hath been the course of all Traitors .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.99

In the 20th of <font> Edward <$$font> II . <font> Isabella <$$font> the
Queen , and the Lord <font> Mortimer <$$font> , gave out , that the
King's Person was not safe , for the good of the Church and Commonwealth
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.100

The Bishop of <font> Carlisle <$$font> did preach on this Text , <font>
My Head is grieved <$$font> , meaning by the Head , the King ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.101

that when the Head began to be negligent , the People might reform what
is amiss . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.102

In the 3d of <font> Henry <$$font> IV . Sir <font> Roger Clarendon
<$$font> , accompany'd with two Priests , gave out That <font> Richard
<$$font> II. Was alive , when he was dead .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.103

<font> Edward <$$font> III. Caused <font> Mortimer <$$font> 's Head to
be cut off , for giving Counsel to murder the King .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.104

The 3d of <font> Henry <$$font> VII . Sir <font> Henry Stanley <$$font>
found the Crown in the Dust , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.105

and set it on the King's Head : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.106

when <font> Fitzwater <$$font> and <font> Garret <$$font> told him ,
that <font> Edward <$$font> V. was alive , he said , <font> If he be
alive , I will assist him <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.107

But this cost him his Head . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.108

<font> Edmund de la Pole <$$font> , Duke of <font> Suffolk <$$font> ,
killed a Man in the Reign of King <font> Henry <$$font> VII. For which
the King would have him hold up his Hand at the Bar ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.109

and then pardoned him : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.110

Yet he took such an Offence thereat , that he sent to the Noblemen to
help to reform the Commonwealth ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.111

and he said , he would go to <font> France <$$font> and get Power there
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.112

Sir <font> Roger Compton <$$font> knew all the Treason ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.113

and discovered <font> Windon <$$font> and others , that were attainted .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.114

He said , there was another thing that would be stood upon , namely ,
that they had but one Witness . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.115

Then he vouched one <font> Appleyard <$$font> 's Case , a Traitor in
<font> Norfolk <$$font> , who said , a Man must have two Accusers .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.116

<font> Helms <$$font> was the Man that accused him ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.117

but Mr. Justice <font> Cotlin <$$font> said , that that Statue was not
in force at that Day . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.118

His Words were , <font> Thrust her into the Ditch <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.119

Then he went on speaking of Accusers , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.120

and made this difference : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.121

An Accuser is a Speaker by Report , when a Witness is he that upon his
Oath shall speak his Knowledge of any Man .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.122

A third sort of Evidence there is likewise ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.123

and this is held more forcible than either of the other two ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.124

and that is , when a Man , by his Accusation of another , shall , by the
same Accusation , also condemn himself , and make himself liable to the
same Fault and Punishment : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.125

This is more forcible than many Witnesses .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.126

So then so much by way of Imitation . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.127

Then he defined Treason : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.128

There is Treason in the Heart , in the Hand , in the Mouth , in
Consummation : comparing that <font> in Corde <$$font> to the Root of a
Tree ; <font> in Ore <$$font> , to the Bud ; <font> in Manu <$$font> to
the Blossom ; and that which is <font> in Consummatione <$$font> , to
the Fruit . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,214.129

{COM:insert_helsinki_sample_1}

<P_1,218>

<font> Attorney <$$font> . <font> Cobham <$$font> saith , he was a long
time doubtful of <font> Raleigh <$$font> , that he would send him and
the Money to the King . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.132

Did <font> Cobham <$$font> fear lest you would betray him in <font>
Jersey ? <$$font> RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.133

Then of necessity there must be Trust between you .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.134

No Man can betray a Man , but he that is trusted , in my understanding .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.135

This is the greatest Argument to prove that he was acquainted with
<font> Cobham <$$font> 's Proceedings . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.136

<font> Raleigh <$$font> has a deeper Reach , than to make himself , as
he said , <font> Robin Hood <$$font> , a <font> Kett <$$font> , or
<font> Cade <$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.137

yet I never heard that <font> Robin Hood <$$font> was a Traitor ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.138

they say he was an outlaw . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.139

And whereas he saith that our King is not only more wealthy and potent
then his Predecessors , but also more politick and wise , so that he
could have no hope to prevail ; I answer , There is no King so potent ,
wise and active , but he may be overtaken thro' Treason .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.140

Whereas you say <font> Spain <$$font> is so poor , discoursing so
largely thereof ; it had been better for you to have kept in <font>
Guiana <$$font> , than to have been so well acquainted with the State of
<font> Spain <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.141

Besides , if you could have brought <font> Spain <$$font> and <font>
Scotland <$$font> to have joined , you might have hoped to prevail a
great deal the better . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.142

For his six Overthrows , I answer , he hath the more Malice , because
Repulses breed Desire of Revenge . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.143

Then you say you never talked with <font> Cobham <$$font> , but about
Leases , and letting Lands , and ordering his House ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.144

I never knew you Clerk of the Kitchen , <font> &c. <$$font>
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.145

If you had fallen on your knees at first , and confessed the Treason ,
it had been better for you . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.146

You say , He meant to have given me a Cabinet of thirty Pound ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.147

perhaps he thought by those means to have anticipated me therewith .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.148

But you say all these are Circumstances : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.149

I answer , all this Accusation in Circumstance is true .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.150

Here now I might appeal to my Lords , that you take hold off this , that
he subscribed not to the Accusation . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.151

<font> Lord Hen. Howard <$$font> . <font> Cobham <$$font> was not then
pressed to subscribe . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.152

<font> Attorney <$$font> . His Accusation being testify'd by the Lords
, is of as great force , as if he had subscrib'd .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.153

<font> Raleigh <$$font> saith again , If the Accuser be alive , he must
be brought face to face to speak ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.154

and alledges 25 <font> Edward <$$font> III. that there must be two
sufficient Witnesses , that must be brought face to face before the
Accused ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.155

and alledgeth 10 and 13 <font> Elizabeth <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.156

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . You try me by the <font> Spanish <$$font>
Inquisition , if you proceed only by the Circumstances , without two
Witnesses . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.157

<font> Attorney <$$font> . This is a treasonable speech .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.158

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . <font> Evertere Hominem justum in Causa sua
injustum est <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.159

Good my Lords , let it be proved , either by the Laws of the Land , or
the Laws of God , that there ought not to be two Witnesses appointed ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.160

yet I will not stand to defend this Point in Law , if the King will have
it so : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.161

it is no rare thing for a Man to be falsely accused .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.162

A Judge condemn'd a Woman in <font> Sarum <$$font> for killing her
Husband on the Testimony of one Witness ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.163

afterwards his Man confessed the Murder , when she was executed : who
after being touch'd in Conscience for the Judgment , was used to say ,
<font> Quod nunquam de hoc facto animam in vita sua pargaret <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.164

It is also commanded by the Scripture ; <font> Allocutus est Jehova
Mosen In Ore duorum aut trium Testium , &c. <$$font>
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.165

If Christ requireth it , as it appeareth , <font> Mat. <$$font> 18 .
if by the Canon , Civil Law , and God's Word , it be required , that
there must be two Witnesses at the least ; bear with me if I desire one
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.166

I would not desire to live , if I were privy to <font> Cobham <$$font>
's Proceedings . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.167

I have been a Slave , a Villain , a Fool , if I had endeavour'd to set
up <font> Arabella <$$font> , and refus'd so gracious a Lord and
Sovereign . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.168

But urge your Proofs . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.169

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> You have offer'd Questions on diverse
Statutes , all which mention two Accusers in case of Indictments :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.170

you have deceiv'd yourself , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.171

for the Laws of 25 <font> Edward <$$font> III. and 5 <font> Edward
<$$font> VI. are repealed . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.172

It sufficeth now if there be Proofs made either under Hand , or by
Testimony of Witnesses , or by Oaths ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.173

it needs not the Subscription of the Party , so there be Hands of
credible Men to testify the Examination . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.174

<font> Raleigh <$$font> It may be an Error in me ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.175

and if those Laws be repeal'd , yet I hope the Equity of them remains
still ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.176

but if you affirm it , it must be a Law to Posterity .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.177

The Proof of the Common Law is by Witness and Jury ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.178

let <font> Cobham <$$font> be here , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.179

let him speak it . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.180

Call my Accuser before my Face , and I have done .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.181

<font> Attorney <$$font> . <font> Scientia Sceleris est mera Ignorantia
<$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.182

You have read the Letter of the Law , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.183

but understand it not . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.184

Here was your Anchor-hold , and your Rendezvous :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.185

you trust to <font> Cobham <$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.186

either <font> Cobham <$$font> must accuse you , or no body ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.187

if he did , then it would not hurt you ; because he is but one Witness ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.188

if he did not , then you are safe . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.189

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . If ever I read a Word of the Law or Statute ,
before I was Prisoner in the Tower , God confound me .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.190

<font> Attorney <$$font> . Now I come to prove the Circumstance of the
Accusation to be true . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.191

<font> Cobham <$$font> confessed he had a Pass-port to travel , hereby
intending to present Overtures to the Arch-Duke , and from thence to go
to <font> Spain <$$font> , and there to have conference with the King
for Money . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.192

You say he promised to come home by <font> Jersey <$$font> , to make
merry with you and your Wife . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.193

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . I said in his return from <font> France
<$$font> , not <font> Spain <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,218.194

<P_1,219>

<font> Attorney <$$font> . Further , in his Examination he saith ,
nothing could be set down for the Distribution of the Money to the
Discontented , without Conference with <font> Raleigh <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.196

You said it should have been for Procurement of Peace ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.197

but it was for raising Rebellion . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.198

Further , <font> Cobham <$$font> saith , he would never have enter'd
into these Courses , but by your Instigation , and that you would never
let him alone . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.199

Your Scholar was not apt enough to tell us all the Plots ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.200

that is enough for you to do , that are his Master .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.201

You intended to trust Sir <font> Arthur Savage <$$font> , whom I take to
be an honest and true Gentleman , but not Sir <font> Arthur George
<$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.202

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . All this is but one Accusation of <font>
Cobham <$$font> 's , I hear no other thing ; to which Accusation he
never subscribed nor {SIC:not} avouched it .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.203

I beseech you , my Lords , let <font> Cobham <$$font> be sent for ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.204

charge him on his Soul , on his Allegiance to the King ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.205

if he affirm it , I am guilty . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.206

<font> Lord Cecil <$$font> . It is the Accusation of my Lord <font>
Cobham <$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.207

it is the Evidence against you : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.208

must it not be of force without his Subscription ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.209

I desire to be resolv'd by the Judges , whether by the Law it is not a
forcible Argument of Evidence . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.210

<font> Judges <$$font> . My Lord , it is .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.211

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . The King at his Coronation is sworn <font> In
omnibus Judiciis suis aequitatem , non rigorem Legis , observare
<$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.212

By the Rigour and Cruelty of the Law it may be a forcible Evidence .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.213

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> That is not the Rigour of the Law , but
the Justice of the Law ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.214

else when a Man hath made a plain Accusation , by Practice he might be
brought to retract it again . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.215

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . Oh my Lord , you may use Equity .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.216

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> That is from the King ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.217

you are to have Justice from us . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.218

<font> Lord Anderson <$$font> . The Law is , if the Matter be proved to
the Jury , they must find guilty ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.219

for <font> Cobham <$$font> 's Accusation is not only against you ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.220

there are other things sufficient . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.221

<font> Lord Cecil <$$font> . Now that Sir <font> Walter Raleigh
<$$font> is satisfy'd , that <font> Cobham <$$font> 's Subscription is
not necessary , I pray you , Mr. Attorney , go on .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.222

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . Good Mr. Attorney , be patient ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.223

and give me leave . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.224

<font> Lord Cecil <$$font> . An unnecessary Patience is a Hindrance ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.225

let him go on with his Proofs , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.226

and then refel them . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.227

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . I would answer particularly .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.228

<font> Lord Cecil <$$font> . If you would have a Table and Pen and Ink
, you shall . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.229

Then Paper and Ink was given him . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.230

Here the Clerk of the Crown read the Letter , which the Lord <font>
Cobham <$$font> did write in <font> July <$$font> , which was to the
effect of his former Examination ; further saying , I have disclos'd all
: RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.231

To accuse any one falsely , were to burden my own Conscience .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.232

<font> Attorney <$$font> . Read <font> Cobham <$$font> 's Confession
the 8th of <font> June <$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.233

he saith , He was offer'd 1000 Crowns to be in this Action .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.234

Here <font> Watson <$$font> 's Additions were read .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.235

The great Mass of Money from the Count was impossible , <font> &c.
<$$font> RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.236

<font> Brook <$$font> 's Confession read . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.237

There have Letters passed , saith he , between <font> Cobham <$$font>
and <font> Aremberg <$$font> , for a great Sum of Money to assist a
second Action , for the surprizing of his Majesty .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.238

<font> Attorney <$$font> . It is not possible it was of Passion ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.239

for it was in talk before three Men , being severally examined , who
agreed in the Sum to be bestow'd on discontented Persons ; That <font>
Grey <$$font> should have 12,000 Crowns , and <font> Raleigh <$$font>
should have 8000 , or 10,000 Crowns . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.240

<font> Cobham <$$font> 's Examination , <font> July <$$font> 18 .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.241

If the Money might be procur'd <paren> saith he <$$paren> then a Man may
give Pensions . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.242

Being asked if a Pension should not be given to his Brother <font> Brook
<$$font> , he deny'd it not . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.243

Lawrency's <font> Examination <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.244

Within five Days after <font> Aremberg <$$font> arrived , <font> Cobham
<$$font> resorted unto him . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.245

That Night that <font> Cobham <$$font> went to <font> Aremberg <$$font>
with <font> Lawrency <$$font> , <font> Raleigh <$$font> supped with him
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.246

<font> Attorney <$$font> . <font> Raleigh <$$font> must have his Part
of the Money , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.247

therefore now he is a Traitor . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.248

The Crown shall never stand one Year on the Head of the King <paren> my
Master <$$paren> if a Traitor may not be condemn'd by Circumstances :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.249

For if A. tells B. and B. tells C. and C. D. <font> &c. <$$font>
you shall never prove Treason by two Witnesses .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.250

Raleigh's <font> Examination was read <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.251

He confesseth <font> Cobham <$$font> offered him 8000 Crowns , which he
was to have for the furtherance of the Peace between <font> England
<$$font> and <font> Spain <$$font> ; and that he should have it within
three Days . To which he said , he gave this Answer ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.252

When I see the Money , I will tell you more :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.253

For I had thought it had been one of his ordinary idle Conceits ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.254

and therefore made no Account thereof . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,219.255

{COM:insert_helsinki_sample_2}

<P_1,223>

<font> Attorney <$$font> . Well , I will now make it appear to the
World , that there never lived a viler Viper upon the face of the Earth
than thou . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,223.258

And therewithal he drew a Letter out of his Pocket , saying further , My
Lords , you shall see this is an Agent that hath writ a Treatise against
the <font> Spaniard <$$font> , and hath ever so detested him ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,223.259

this is he that hath spent so much Money against him in Service ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,223.260

and yet you shall all see whether his Heart be not wholly <font> Spanish
<$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,223.261

The Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> , who of his own Nature was a good and
honourable Gentleman , till overtaken by this Wretch , now finding his
Conscience heavily burdened with some Courses which the Subtilty of this
Traitor had drawn him into ; my Lords , he <P_1,224> could be at no rest
with himself , nor quiet in his {COM:preceding_word_"his"_emended}
thoughts , until he was eased of that heavy Weight : out of which
Passion of his Mind , and discharge of his Duty to his Prince , and his
Conscience to God , taking it upon his Salvation that he wrote nothing
but the Truth , with his own Hands he wrote this Letter .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.262

Now , Sir , you shall see whether you had Intelligence with <font>
Cobham <$$font> , within four days before he came to the <font> Tower
<$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.263

If he be wholly <font> Spanish <$$font> , that desired a Pension of 1500
l. a Year from <font> Spain <$$font> , that <font> Spain <$$font> by
him might have Intelligence , then <font> Raleigh <$$font> is a Traitor
: RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.264

He hath taken an Apple , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.265

and pinned a Letter unto it , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.266

and threw it into my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> 's Window ; the
Contents whereof were this , <font> It is doubtful whether we shall be
proceeded with or no , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.267

perhaps you shall not be tried <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.268

This was to get a Retractation . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.269

Oh ! It was <font> Adam <$$font> 's Apple , whereby the Devil did
deceive him . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.270

Further , he wrote thus , <font> Do not as my Lord of <$$font> Essex
<font> did <$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.271

<font> take heed of a Preacher <$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.272

<font> for by his Persuasion he confessed , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.273

and made himself guilty <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.274

I doubt not but this day God shall have as great a Conquest by this
Traitor , and the Son of God shall be as much glorified , as when it was
said , <font> Vicisti , Galilaee <$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.275

you know my Meaning . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.276

What tho' <font> Cobham <$$font> retracted , yet he could not rest nor
sleep till he confirmed it again . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.277

If this be not enough to prove him a Traitor , the King my Master shall
not live three Years to an End . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.278

<font> Nota <$$font> , Here Mr. Attorney produced the Lord <font>
Cobham <$$font> 's Letters , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.279

and as he read it , inserted some Speeches .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.280

' I have thought fit to set down this to my Lords , wherein I protest on
my Soul to write nothing but the Truth . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.281

I am now come near the period of my time , wherefore I confess the whole
Truth before God and his Angels . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.282

<font> Raleigh <$$font> , four days before I came from the <font> Tower
<$$font> , caused an Apple <paren> <font> Eve <$$font> 's <font> Apple
<$$font> <$$paren> to be thrown at my Chamber-Window ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.283

the effect of it was , to intreat me to right the Wrong that I had done
him , in saying , <font> that I should have come home by Jersey <$$font>
; which under my hand to him I have retracted .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.284

His first Letter I answered not , which was thrown in the same manner ;
wherein he prayed me to write him a Letter , which I did .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.285

He sent me word , that the Judges met at Mr. Attorney's House , and
that there was good hope the Proceedings against us should be stayed :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.286

He sent me another time a little Tobacco . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.287

At <font> Aremberg <$$font> 's coming , <font> Raleigh <$$font> was to
have procured a Pension of fifteen_hundred Pounds a Year , for which he
promised , that no Action should be against <font> Spain <$$font> , the
<font> Low-Countries <$$font> , or the <font> Indies <$$font> , but he
would give knowledge before-hand . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.288

He told me , the States had Audience with the King .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.289

<paren> Attorney , <font> Ah ! Is not this a <$$font> Spanish <font>
Heart in an <$$font> English <font> Body ? <$$paren> <$$font>
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.290

' He hath been the original Cause of my Ruin ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.291

for I had no dealing with <font> Aremberg <$$font> , but by his
Instigation . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.292

He hath also been the cause of my Discontentment ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.293

he advised me , not to be overtaken with Preachers , as <font> Essex
<$$font> was ; and that the King would better allow of a constant Denial
, than to accuse any . ' RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.294

<font> Attorney <$$font> . Oh damnable Atheist !
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.295

He hath learned some Text of Scripture to serve his own purpose , but
falsely alledg'd . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.296

He counsels him not to be counseled by Preachers , as <font> Essex
<$$font> was : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.297

He died the Child of God , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.298

God honoured him at his Death ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.299

thou wast by when he died : <font> Et Lupus & turpes instant morientibus
Ursae <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.300

He died indeed for his Offence . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.301

The King himself spake these Words ; <font> He that shall say <$$font> ,
Essex <font> died not for Treason , is punishable <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.302

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . You have heard a strange Tale of a strange
Man . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.303

Now he thinks , he hath Matter enough to destroy me ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.304

but the King and all of you shall witness , by our Deaths , which of us
was the Ruin of the other . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.305

I bid a poor Fellow throw in the Letter at his Window , written to this
purpose ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.306

<font> You know you have undone me , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.307

now write three lines to justify me <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.308

In this I will die , that he hath done me wrong :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.309

Why did not he acquaint him with my Dispositions ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.310

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> But what say you now of the Letter ,
and the Pension of 1500 l. <font> per_annum ? <$$font>
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.311

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . I say , that <font> Cobham <$$font> is a base
, dishonourable , poor Soul . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.312

<font> Attorney <$$font> . Is he base ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.313

I return it into thy Throat on his behalf : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.314

But for thee , he had been a good Subject .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.315

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> I perceive you are not so clear a Man ,
as you have protested all this while ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.316

for you should have discovered these Matters to the King .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.317

<font> Nota <$$font> , Here <font> Raleigh <$$font> pulled a Letter out
of his Pocket , which the Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> had written to him
, RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.318

and desired my Lord <font> Cecil <$$font> to read it , because he only
knew his Hand ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.319

the effect of it was as follows : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.320

<font> Cobham <$$font> 's <font> Letter of Justification to <$$font>
Raleigh . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.321

' Seeing myself so near my End , for the discharge of my own Conscience
, and freeing myself from your Blood , which else will cry Vengeance
against me ; I protest upon my Salvation I never practised with <font>
Spain <$$font> by your Procurement ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.322

God so comfort me in this my Affliction , as you are a true Subject ,
for any thing that I know . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.323

I will say as <font> Daniel <$$font> , <font> Purus sum a sanguine hujus
<$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.324

So God have mercy upon my Soul , as I know no Treason by you . '
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.325

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . Now I wonder how many Souls this Man hath !
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.326

He damns one in this Letter , and another in that .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.327

Here was much ado : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.328

Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> alledged , that his last Letter was
politickly and cunningly urged from the Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> ,
and that first was simply the Truth ; and that lest it should seem
doubtful that the first Letter was drawn from my Lord <font> Cobham
<$$font> by promise of Mercy , or hope of Favour , the Lord Chief
Justice willed that the Jury might herein be satisfied . Whereupon the
Earl of <font> Devonshire <$$font> delivered , that the same was meet
voluntary , and not extracted from the Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> upon
any Hopes or promise of Pardon . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.329

<font> Nota <$$font> , This was the last Evidence : whereupon a Marshal
was sworn to keep the Jury private . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.330

The Jury departed , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.331

and staid not a quarter of an hour , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.332

but returned , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.333

and gave their Verdict , Guilty . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,224.334

<P_1,225>

<font> Serj. Heale <$$font> demanded Judgment against the Prisoner .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.336

<font> Clerk of the Crown <$$font> . Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>
, Thou hast been indicted , arraigned , and pleaded Not Guilty , for all
these several Treasons , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.337

and for Trial thereof , hast put thy self upon thy Country ; which
Country are these , who have found thee Guilty .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.338

What canst thou say for thy self , why Judgment and Execution of Death
should not pass against thee ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.339

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . My Lords , the Jury have found me Guilty :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.340

They just do as they are directed . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.341

I can say nothing why Judgment should not proceed .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.342

You see whereof <font> Cobham <$$font> hath accused me :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.343

You remember his Protestations , that I was never Guilty .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.344

I desire the King should know of the Wrongs done unto me since I came
hither . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.345

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> You have had no Wrong , Sir <font>
Walter <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.346

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . Yes , of Mr. Attorney .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.347

I desire my Lords to remember three things to the King .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.348

1 . I was accused to be a Practiser with <font> Spain : <$$font>
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.349

I never knew that my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> meant to go thither ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.350

I will ask no Mercy at the King's hands , if he will affirm it .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.351

2 . I never knew of the Practice with <font> Arabella <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.352

3 . I never knew of my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> 's Practice with
<font> Aremberg <$$font> , nor of the surprizing Treason .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.353

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> In my Conscience , I am persuaded that
<font> Cobham <$$font> hath accused you truly .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.354

You can@ @not deny , but that you were dealt with to have a Pension to
be a Spy for <font> Spain <$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.355

therefore you are not so true to the King as you have protested your
self to be . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.356

<font> Raleigh <$$font> . I submit my self to the King's Mercy ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.357

I know his Mercy is greater than my Offence .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.358

I recommend my Wife , and Son of tender years , unbrought up , to his
Compassion . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.359

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> I thought I should never have seen this
Day , to have stood in this Place to give Sentence of Death against you
, because I thought it impossible , that one of so great Parts should
have fallen so grievously . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.360

God hath bestowed on you many Benefits . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.361

You had been a Man fit and able to have served the King in good Place .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.362

You had brought your self into a good State of Living ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.363

if you had entered into a good Consideration of your Estate , and not
suffered your own Wit to have intrapped your self , you might have lived
in good Comfort . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.364

It is best for Man not to seek to climb too high , lest he fall : nor
yet to creep too low , lest he be trodden on .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.365

It was the Poesy of the wisest and greatest Counsellor of our time in
<font> England <$$font> , <font> In medio spatio mediocria firma
locantur <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.366

You might have lived well with 3000 l. a Year ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.367

for so I have heard your Revenues to be . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.368

I know nothing might move you to be discontented ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.369

but if you had been down , you know Fortune's Wheel , when it is turned
about , riseth again . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.370

I never heard that the King took away any thing from you , but the
Captainship of the Guard , which he did with very good reason , to have
one of his own Knowledge , whom he might trust , in that Place .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.371

You have been taken for a wise Man , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.372

and so have shewed Wit enough this day . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.373

Again , for Monopolies for Wine , <font> &c. <$$font> if the King had
said , It is a Matter that offends my People , should I burden them for
your private Good ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.374

I think you could not well take it hardly , that his Subjects were eased
, tho' by your private Hindrance . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.375

Two Vices have lodged chiefly in you ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.376

one is an eager Ambition , the other corrupt Covetousness .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.377

Ambition , in desiring to be advanced to equal Grace and Favour , as you
have been before-time ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.378

that Grace you had then , you got not in a Day or Year .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.379

For your Covetousness , I am sorry to hear that a Gentleman of your
Wealth should become a base Spy for the Enemy , which is the vilest of
all other ; wherein on my Conscience <font> Cobham <$$font> hath said
true : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.380

by it you would have increased your Living 1500 <font> l. <$$font> a
Year . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.381

This Covetousness is like a Canker , that eats the Iron Place where it
lives . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.382

Your Case being thus , let it not grieve you , if I speak a little out
of Zeal , and Love to your Good . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.383

You have been taxed by the World , with the Defence of the most
heathenish and blasphemous Opinions , which I list not to repeat ,
because Christian Ears can@ @not endure to hear them , nor the Authors
and Maintainers of them be suffered to live in any Christian
Commonwealth . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.384

You know what Men said of <font> Harpool <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.385

You shall do well , before you go out of the World , to give
Satisfaction therein , and not to die with these Imputations on you .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.386

Let not any Devil persuade you to think there is no Eternity in Heaven :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.387

for if you think thus , you shall find Eternity in Hell-Fire .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.388

In the first Accusation of my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> , I observed
his Manner of speaking ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.389

I protest before the Living God , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.390

I am persuaded he spoke nothing but the Truth .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.391

You wrote , that he should not in any case confess any thing to a
Preacher , telling him an Example of my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> ,
that noble Earl that is gone ; who , if he had not been carried away
with others , had lived in Honour to this Day among us :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.392

He confessed his Offences , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.393

and obtained Mercy of the Lord ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.394

for I am verily persuaded in my Heart , he died a worthy Servant of God
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.395

Your Conceit of not confessing any thing , is very inhuman and wicked .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.396

In this World is the time of confessing , that we may be absolv'd at the
Day of Judgment . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.397

You have shewed a fearful Sign of denying God , in advising a Man not to
confess the Truth . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.398

It now comes in my mind , why you may not have your Accuser come face to
face : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.399

for such an one is easily brought to retract , when he seeth there is no
hope of his own Life . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.400

It is dangerous that any Traitors should have Access to , or Conference
with one another ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.401

when they see themselves must die , they will think it best to have
their Fellow live , that he may commit the like Treason again , and so
in some sort seek Revenge . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.402

Now it resteth to pronounce the Judgment , which I wish you had not been
this day to have received of me : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.403

For if the Fear of God in you had been answerable to your other great
Parts , you might have lived to have been a singular good Subject .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.404

I never saw the like Trial , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.405

and hope I shall never see the like again .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.406

<font> The Judgment <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.407

But since you have been found guilty of these horrible Treasons , the
Judgment of this Court is , That you shall be had from hence to the
Place whence you came , there to remain until the day of Execution ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.408

and from thence you shall be drawn upon a Hurdle thro' the open Streets
to the Place of Execution , there to be hanged and cut down alive ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,225.409

and <P_1,226> your Body shall be opened , your Heart and Bowels pluck'd
out , and your Privy Members cut off , and thrown into the Fire before
your Eyes , then your Head to be stricken off from your Body ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.410

and your Body shall be divided into four Quarters , to be disposed of at
the King's Pleasure : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.411

And God have Mercy upon your Soul . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.412

Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> besought the Earl of <font>
Devonshire <$$font> , and the Lords , to be Suitors on his behalf to the
King ; that in regard of Places of Estimation he did bear in his
Majesty's time , the Rigour of his Judgment might be qualified , and his
Death be honourable , and not ignominious . Wherein after they had
promised him to do their utmost Endeavours , the Court rose , and the
Prisoner was carried up again to the Castle .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.413

Fourteen Years Sir <font> Walter <$$font> had spent in the <font> Tower
<$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.414

and being weary of a State wherein he could be only serviceable by his
Pen , but not in a Capacity of serving and enriching his Country any
other way , <paren> of whom Prince <font> Henry <$$font> would say ,
that no King but his Father would keep such a Bird in a Cage ; <$$paren>
at length he fell upon an Enterprize of a Golden Mine in <font> Guiana
<$$font> in the Southern Parts of <font> America <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.415

The Proposition of this was presented and recommended to his Majesty by
Sir <font> Ralph Winwood <$$font> Secretary of State , as a Matter not
in the Air , or Speculative , but Real , and of Certainty ; for that Sir
<font> Walter <$$font> had seen of the Ore of the Mine , and tried the
Richness of it , having gotten a Pound from thence by the hands of
Captain <font> Kemish <$$font> 's ancient Servant .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.416

Sir <font> Ralph Winwood <$$font> 's Recommendation of the Design , and
the earnest Sollicitations for his Enlargement by the Queen and Prince ,
and the <font> French <$$font> Leiger , <paren> with much affection to
his Deserts , not without some politick Designs on <font> Spain <$$font>
together with the Asseverations of Sir <font> Walter <$$font> of the
Truth of the Mine , work'd upon his Majesty , who thought himself in
honour obliged , nay , in a manner ingaged <paren> as the Declaration
which he published after the Death of Sir <font> Walter <$$font> tells
us <$$paren> not to deny unto his People the Adventure and Hope of so
great Riches to be sought and atchieved at the Charge of Voluntiers ,
especially since it stood so well with his Majesty's Politick and
Magnanimous Courses in these his flourishing times of Peace , to nourish
and encourage noble and generous Enterprizes for Plantations ,
Discoveries , and opening of a New Trade . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.417

Count <font> Gondomar <$$font> <paren> an active and subtle Instrument
to serve his Master's ends <$$paren> took alarm at this ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.418

and represented to his Majesty the Enterprize of Sir <font> Walter
<$$font> to be hostile and predatory , intending a breach of the Peace
between the two Crowns . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.419

But notwithstanding , Power at last is granted to Sir <font> Walter
<$$font> to set forth Ships and Men for that Service .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.420

However , the King commanded him , upon pain of his Allegiance , to give
him under his hand <paren> promising , on the Word of a King , to keep
it secret <$$paren> the Number of his Men , the Burden and Strength of
his Ships , together with the Country and River which he was to enter :
Which being done accordingly by Sir <font> Walter <$$font> , that very
original Paper was found in the <font> Spanish <$$font> Governor's
Closet at <font> St. Thomas <$$font> 's . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.421

So active were the <font> Spanish <$$font> Ministers , that
Advertisement was sent to <font> Spain <$$font> , and thence to the
<font> Indies <$$font> , before the <font> English <$$font> Fleet got
out of the <font> Thames <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.422

But as we have just Cause to admire the more than usual Activity of the
<font> Spanish <$$font> Agents , so may we wonder no less at the
Miscarriage of his Majesty's present Ministers , who , notwithstanding
he had pass'd his Royal Word to the {COM:missing_material} , yet they
did help Count <font> Gondomar <$$font> to that very Paper ; so much
both King and Court were at <font> Gondomar <$$font> 's Service .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.423

A Commission indeed is granted , but by <font> Gondomar <$$font> 's
means is limited , That the Fleet should commit no Outrages upon the
King of <font> Spain <$$font> 's Subjects by Land , unless they began
first . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.424

With this Commission , and the Company of several brave Captains , and
other Knights and Gentlemen of great Blood and Worth , he set out in
quest of the Mine , with a compleat Fleet of twelve Sail ; letting fall
a Speech at his Departure , which was rather an Argument of his Wit than
his Wisdom ; <font> That the whole History of the World had not the like
Precedent , of a King's Prisoner to purchase Freedom , and his
Bosom-Favourite to have the Halter , but in Scripture <$$font> ,
Mordecai <font> and <$$font> Haman ; meaning himself and the Earl of
<font> Somerset <$$font> . To which he was told , that the King replied
, <font> He might die in that Deceit <$$font> . Which he did ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.425

for <font> Somerset <$$font> was saved . Of whom was made good what Sir
<font> Walter <$$font> used to say of Favourites , That Minions were not
so happy as vulgar Judgments thought them , being frequently commanded
to uncomely , and sometimes to unnatural Employments .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.426

On the 17th of <font> November <$$font> , he arrived at <font> Guiana
<$$font> , having been much retarded by contrary Winds , and having lost
several of his Voluntiers in the Voyage , by a violent Calenture .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.427

When Sir <font> Walter <$$font> was returned to <font> Plymouth <$$font>
, Sir Lewis <font> Steukly <$$font> , Vice-Admiral of the County of
<font> Devon <$$font> , seized him , being commissioned by his Majesty
to bring him to <font> London <$$font> ; which could add no Terror to a
Person who could expect nothing less . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.428

When he was brought to <font> London <$$font> , he was permitted the
confinement of his own House , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.429

But finding the Court wholly guided by <font> Gondomar <$$font> , he
could hope for little Mercy ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.430

therefore he wisely contriv'd the design of an Escape into <font> France
<$$font> ; which Sir <font> Lewis Steukly <$$font> betrayed .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.431

The Voyage proving unsuccessful , King <font> James <$$font> was willing
to sacrifice the Life of Sir <font> Walter <$$font> to the advancement
of Peace with <font> Spain <$$font> , but not upon such grounds as the
Embassador had designed : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.432

for he desired a Judgment upon the pretended Breach of Peace , that by
this Occasion he might slily gain from the <font> English <$$font> an
Acknowledgment of his Master's Right in those Places , and hereafter
both stop their Mouths , and quench their Heat and Valour .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.433

Hence they resolv'd to proceed against him upon his old Condemnation ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.434

for having had Experience upon a former Trial , they cared not to run
the hazard of a second . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,226.435

Accordingly upon <font> Wednesday <$$font> , the 28th of <font> October
<$$font> , <font> Anno Dom. <$$font> 1618 , the Lieutenant of the
<font> Tower <$$font> , in pursuance of a Writ of <font> Habeas Corpus
<$$font> to him directed , brought Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>
from the <font> Tower <$$font> to the <font> Kings-Bench <$$font> Bar at
<font> Westminster <$$font> . Where <P_1,227> Mr. Attorney spake in
effect thus : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.436

My Lords , Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> , the Prisoner at the Bar
, was , fifteen Years since , convicted of High Treason , by him
committed against the Person of his Majesty , and the State of this
Kingdom , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.437

and then received the Judgment of Death to be hang'd , drawn , and
quartered : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.438

His Majesty , of his abundant Grace , hath been pleased to shew Mercy
upon him {SIC:his} 'till now , that Justice calls unto him for Execution
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.439

Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> hath been a Statesman , and a Man ,
who , in regard of his Parts and Quality , is to be pitied :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.440

He hath been as a Star , at which the World hath gazed ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.441

but Stars may fall , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.442

nay , they must fall , when they trouble the Sphere wherein they abide .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.443

It is therefore His Majesty's Pleasure now to call for Execution of the
former Judgment , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.444

and I require Order for the same . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.445

Then Mr. <font> Fanshaw <$$font> , Clerk of the Crown , read the Record
of the Conviction and Judgment , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.446

and called to the Prisoner , to hold up his Hand , which he did .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.447

Then was the Prisoner ask'd , What he could say for himself , why
Execution should not be awarded against him ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.448

Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.449

My Lords , my Voice is grown weak , by reason of my late Sickness , and
an Ague , which I now have ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.450

for I was even now brought hither out of it .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.451

<font> Lord Chief Justice <$$font> . Sir <font> Walter <$$font> , your
Voice is audible enough . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.452

Sir <font> Walter <$$font> . Then , my Lord , all that I can say is
this ; That the Judgment which I received to die so long since , I hope
it can@ @not now be strain'd to take away my Life ; for that since it
was His Majesty's Pleasure to grant me a Commission to proceed in a
Voyage beyond the Seas , where I had Power , as Marshal , on the Life
and Death of others , so , under Favour , I presume I am discharged of
that Judgment : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.453

For , by that Commission I departed the Land ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.454

and undertook a Journey , to honour my Sovereign , and to enrich his
Kingdom with Gold , of the Ore whereof this Hand hath found and taken in
<font> Guiana <$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.455

but the Voyage , notwithstanding my Endeavour , had no other Success ,
but what was fatal to me , the Loss of my Son , and wasting of my whole
Estate . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.456

<font> Being about to proceed , he was by the Lord Chief Justice
interrupted , who spake : <$$font> RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.457

<font> Lord Chief Justice <$$font> . Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>
, this which you now speak touching your Voyage , is not to the purpose
, RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.458

neither can your Commission any way help you ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.459

by that you are not pardon'd ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.460

for by words of a special Nature , in Case of Treason , you must be
pardon'd , and not implicitly . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.461

There was no Word tending to Pardon in all your Commission ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.462

and therefore you must say something else to the purpose ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.463

otherwise , we must proceed to give Execution .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.464

Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> . If your Opinion be so , my Lord ,
I am satisfied , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.465

and so put myself on the Mercy of the King , who I know is gracious ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.466

and , under Favour , I must say I hope he will be pleased to take
Commiseration upon me . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.467

As concerning that Judgment which is so long past , and which , I think
, here are some could witness , nay , his Majesty was of Opinion , that
I had hard Measure therein . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.468

<font> Lord Chief Justice <$$font> . Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>
, you must remember yourself ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.469

you had an honourable Trial , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.470

and so were justly convicted ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.471

and it were Wisdom in you now to submit yourself , and to confess your
Offence did justly draw upon you that Judgment which was then pronounced
against you ; wherefore I pray you attend what I shall say unto you .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.472

I am here called to grant Execution upon the Judgment given you Fifteen
Years since ; all which Time you have been as a dead Man in the Law ,
and might at any Minute been cut off , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.473

but the King in Mercy spared you . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.474

You might think it heavy , if this were done in cold Blood , to call you
to Execution , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.475

but it is not so ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.476

for new Offences have stirred up his Majesty's Justice , to remember to
revive what the Law hath formerly cast upon you .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.477

I know you have been valiant and wise , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.478

and I doubt not but you retain both these Virtues ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.479

for now you shall have Occasion to use them .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.480

Your Faith hath heretofore been questioned ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.481

but I am resolved you are a good Christian ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.482

for your Book , which is an admirable Work , doth testify as much .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.483

I would give you Counsel , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.484

but I know you can apply unto yourself far better than I am able to give
you ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.485

yet will I , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.486

with the good Neighbour in the Gospel , who finding one in the Way ,
wounded and distress'd , pour'd Oil into his Wounds , and refresh'd him
, I give unto you the Oil of Comfort ; though , in respect that I am a
Minister of the Law , mixed with Vinegar . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.487

Sorrow will not avail you in some kind : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.488

For , were you pain'd , Sorrow would not ease you ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.489

were you afflicted , Sorrow would not relieve you ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.490

were you tormented , Sorrow could not content you ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.491

and yet , the Sorrow for your Sins would be an everlasting Comfort to
you . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.492

You must do as that Valiant Captain did , who perceiving himself in
danger , said , in defiance of Death ; <font> Death , thou expectest me
, RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.493

but maugre thy Spite , I expect thee <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.494

Fear not Death too much , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.495

nor fear not Death too little : RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.496

not too much , lest you fail in your Hopes ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.497

not too little , lest you die presumptuously .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.498

And here I must conclude with my Prayers to God for it ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.499

and that he would have mercy on your Soul .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.500

And so the Lord Chief Justice ended with these Words ; <font> Execution
is granted . <$$font> RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.501

Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> . My Lord , I desire thus much
Favour , that I may not be cut off suddenly ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.502

for I have something to do in Discharge of my Conscience , and something
to satisfy his Majesty in , something to satisfy the World in :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.503

and I desire I may be heard at the Day of my Death .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.504

And here I take God to be my Judge , before whom I shall shortly appear
, I was never disloyal to his Majesty , which I will justify where I
shall not fear the Face of any King on Earth :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.505

And so I beseech you all to pray for me . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.506

The Court having awarded Execution , the Sheriffs of <font> Middlesex
<$$font> were commanded for that Purpose to take him into their Custody
, who presently carried him to the <font> Gatehouse <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,227.507

But all Persons have wonder'd how that old Sentence , that had lain
dormant sixteen years and upwards against Sir <font> Walter <$$font> ,
could have been made use of to take off his Head afterwards :
Considering the then Lord Chancellor <font> Verulam <$$font> told him
positively , <paren> as Sir <font> Walter <$$font> was acquainting
<P_1,228> him with that Proffer of Sir <font> William St. Geon <$$font>
for a Pecuniary Pardon , which might have been obtained for a less Sum
than his <font> Guiana <$$font> Preparations amounted to <$$paren> in
these words : ' Sir , the Knee-Timber of your Voyage is Money ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,228.508

spare your Purse in this Particular , RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,228.509

for upon my life you have a sufficient Pardon for all that is passed
already , the King having , under his Broad-Seal , made you Admiral of
your Fleet , and given you power of the Martial Law over the Officers
and Soldiers . ' RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,228.510

It was the Opinion of most Lawyers , That he , who by his Majesty's
Patent had power of Life and Death over the King's Liege People , should
be esteemed or judged <font> Rectus in Curia <$$font> , and free from
all old Convictions . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,228.511

But Sir <font> Walter <$$font> hath made the best Defence for his <font>
Guiana <$$font> Actions , in his Letter to his Majesty , which is here
inserted . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,228.512

{COM:letter_omitted}

But this Apology , tho' never so persuasive , could not satisfy <font>
Gondomar <$$font> 's Rage , who was resolv'd to sacrifice the only
Favourite left of Queen <font> Elizabeth <$$font> , to the <font>
Spanish <$$font> Interest : And who , as <font> Osburn <$$font> remarks
, was the only Person of <font> Essex <$$font> 's Enemies that died
lamented ; and the only Man of Note left alive , that had help'd to beat
the <font> Spaniard <$$font> in the Year 1588 .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,228.514

The Night before the Execution , Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>
wrote the following Letters , the one to the <font> King <$$font> , the
other to his <font> Wife <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-P1,1,228.515
