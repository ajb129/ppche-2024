Whereas , in truth , the said <font> William Ireland <$$font> did not
take his leave of him the said <font> Titus Oates <$$font> , or of any
other Person whatsoever , at his the said <font> William Ireland
<$$font> 's Chamber , then being in <font> Russel-street <$$font>
aforesaid , between the said <font> 8_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> and <font> 12_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> Day of <font> August
<$$font> , in the Year of our Lord 1678 . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.3

And so the said <font> Titus Oates <$$font> did then and there commit
willful and corrupt Perjury . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.4

And this is laid to be to the great Displeasure of <font> Almighty God
<$$font> , in contempt of the Laws of this Land , to the evil and
pernicious Example of all others in the like Case offending , and
against the King's Peace , Crown and Dignity . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.5

To this he has pleaded , <font> Not Guilty <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.6

If we prove it , we do not question , OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.7

but you will find him <font> Guilty <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.8

<font> Mr. Att. Gen. <$$font> May it please your Lordship , and you
Gentlemen of the Jury ; Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> stands indicted for
having perjured himself ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.9

The Instances Gentlemen , that we charge him with , are these :
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.10

First , What he swore at the Trial of <font> Ireland <$$font> ;
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.11

and we say , that at that Trial he did swear <font> Ireland <$$font> was
in Town the 1st or 2d of <font> September <$$font> , 1678 .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.12

The second Instance is , what he swore at the Trial of the five Jesuits
: OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.13

and there we say , he did swear , that <font> Ireland <$$font> was in
Town between the <font> 8_th {COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font>
and <font> 12_th {COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> of <font>
August <$$font> , and that he took his leave of him here in Town at his
Chamber in <font> Russel-street <$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.14

and we do charge him by this Indictment , that he has forsworn himself
in both Instances : And that <font> Ireland <$$font> , Gentlemen , was
neither in Town between the <font> 8_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> and <font> 12_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> of <font> August <$$font> ,
nor the <font> 1_st {COM:font_change_only_around_"st"} <$$font> or
<font> 2_d {COM:font_change_only_around_"d"} <$$font> of <font>
September <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.15

And we shall make it out very evidently : OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.16

For , Gentlemen , as to the Proof in this Case , our Case stands thus :
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.17

we say , that the <font> 3_d {COM:font_change_only_around_"d"} <$$font>
of <font> August <$$font> , 1678 , <font> Ireland <$$font> went into
<font> Hertfordshire <$$font> , to a House of my Lord <font> Aston's
<$$font> , and from then went into <font> Staffordshire <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.18

I will not stand to open the Particulars where he was every Day ;
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.19

but we shall give you an Account , in a Method very easy to be
remembered and observed , where he was till the <font> 14_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> of <font> September <$$font>
. OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.20

But one remarkable Instance , Gentlemen , I desire to take particular
notice of ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.21

and that is , the Time of <font> Pancras <$$font> Fair , which is upon
the <font> 2_d {COM:font_change_only_around_"d"} <$$font> of <font>
September <$$font> always , a known Day , and a known Place in that
Country . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.22

Now we have among the rest , many Witnesses to prove , that Mr. <font>
Ireland <$$font> was there that Day , and not in Town .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.23

And when we have proved this , as we shall by a whole Cloud of Witnesses
, I believe , you Gentlemen of this Jury , will no more doubt that Mr.
<font> Oates <$$font> is forsworn in these Particulars , than the Jury
yesterday did in that Particular ; nor than , I believe , the whole
Kingdom does by this time . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.24

<font> Mr. Sol. Gen. <$$font> My Lord , we shall go to our Evidence ;
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.25

and first , we produce the Records of the two Trials of <font> Ireland
<$$font> , the five Jesuits . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.26

Swear Mr. <font> Swift <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.27

<bracket> <font> Which was done . <$$font> <$$bracket>
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.28

Pray , Sir , put in the Records . Are those true Copies ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.29

Mr. <font> Swift <$$font> . My Lord , I examined these Records with
the Originals , OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.30

and they are true Copies {COM:sic_punctuation} ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.31

<font> Mr. Att. Gen. <$$font> Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> , will you
have them read ? OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.32

Or to save the time of the Court , will you agree them ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.33

<font> Oates <$$font> . My Lord , I consent to save the time of the
Court ; if they shall be made use of for Evidence for me .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.34

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No doubt they are Evidence for you as well
as against you , when they are produced here . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.35

<font> Mr. Sol. Gen. <$$font> If Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> does
admit the Records then shall we go on , and prove what he did swear at
those Trials ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.36

and for the first part of the time , which is between the <font> 8_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> and <font> 12_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> of <font> August <$$font> ,
1678 , we desire that Mr. <font> Thomas Harriot <$$font> , and Mr.
<font> Rainsford Waterhouse <$$font> may be sworn .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.37

<bracket> <font> Which was done <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.38

<font> Mr. Att. Gen. <$$font> Mr. <font> Harriot <$$font> , pray ,
do you remember at the Trial of the five Jesuits , was Mr. <font> Oates
<$$font> produced and sworn as a Witness ? OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.39

Mr. <font> Harriot <$$font> . Yes , he was , My Lord .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.40

<font> Mr. Att. Gen. <$$font> Do you remember what Testimony he gave
about <font> Ireland <$$font> 's being in Town , and when it was , he
said , he was in Town ? OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.41

Mr. <font> Harriot <$$font> . My Lord , he did positively swear , that
Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> , the late Jesuit , did take his leave of
him , the said <font> Oates <$$font> and others , at the said <font>
Ireland <$$font> 's Chamber in <font> Russel-street <$$font> , betwixt
the <font> 8_th {COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> and <font>
12_th {COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> of <font> August
<$$font> , 1678 . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.42

<font> Mr. Sol. Gen. <$$font> Were you of the Jury that tried the
five Jesuits , Mr. <font> Harriot <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.43

Mr. <font> Harriot <$$font> . Yes , I was Foreman of that Jury .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.44

<font> Mr. Sol. Gen. <$$font> What say you , Mr. <font> Waterhouse ?
<$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.45

Were you present at the Trial ? OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.46

Mr. <font> Waterhouse <$$font> . Yes , I was of the Jury too .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.47

<font> Mr. Sol. Gen. <$$font> What did <font> Oates <$$font> swear at
that Trial ? OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.48

Mr. <font> Waterhouse <$$font> . He said , that Mr. <font> Ireland
<$$font> took his leave of him the <font> 12_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> of <font> August <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.49

My Lord Chief Justice <font> Scroggs <$$font> then asked him , are you
sure it was the <font> 12_th {COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} ?
<$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.50

And then he said , he would not be positive it was the <font> 12_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> , OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.51

but between the <font> 8_th {COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font>
and the <font> 12_th {COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> it was
, OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.52

I am positive upon my Oath . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.53

<font> Mr. Att. Gen. <$$font> It is so in the Print too ,
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.54

but we will now go on . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.55

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But will the Defendant ask these Witnesses
any Questions ? OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.56

<font> Oates <$$font> . My Lord , if your Lordship please , I will ask
Mr. <font> Harriot <$$font> a Question . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.57

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay , do ask him what you will .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.58

<font> Oates <$$font> . Mr. <font> Harriot <$$font> , did I swear ,
that he took his leave of me , or I took my leave of him ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.59

- Mr. <font> Harriot <$$font> . You swore , that <font> Ireland
<$$font> took his leave of you and others , between the <font> 8_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> and <font> 12_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> of <font> August <$$font> ,
1678 ; between those two Days , and in that Year .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.60

Mr. Just. <font> Withins <$$font> . It is a nice Question that of
your's , Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> , upon my Word .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.61

<font> Oates <$$font> . My Lord , I know what reason I have to ask that
Question ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,71.62

I am <P_4,72> sure in Perjury , the Court ought to keep up the Witnesses
strictly to what is laid in the Indictment . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.63

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , you have his Answer according to the
Indictment . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.64

<font> Oates <$$font> . Pray , my Lord , be pleased to ask Mr. <font>
Harriot <$$font> this Question , Whether he took Notes of the Trial ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.65

- Mr. <font> Harriot <$$font> . Yes , I did so , Sir .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.66

<font> Oates <$$font> , My Lord , I desire to know of Mr. <font>
Harriot <$$font> , Whether he has those Notes by him ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.67

Mr. <font> Harriot <$$font> . No , Sir , I have them not here ;
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.68

but I have had them by me this four or five Years , or more .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.69

It was my manner in all the Trials , wherein I was concerned as a
Jury-Man , to read the Trials strictly over , when they were printed ,
especially where I happened to have any Notes that I took at the Trial ,
and to compare the printed Trial with my Notes ;
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.70

and where I found anything doubtful , I used to put a Query upon it .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.71

And this and many other things , I found to be in the printed Trials
strictly according to my Notes . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.72

<font> Oates <$$font> . My Lord , I desire to know , what Trial he was
Foreman at ? OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.73

Mr. <font> Harriot <$$font> . That of the five <font> Jesuits <$$font>
, in <font> June <$$font> ; the <font> 13_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> of <font> June <$$font> ,
1679 . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.74

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Have you any thing to ask Mr. <font>
Waterhouse ? <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.75

<font> Oates <$$font> . Yes , my Lord . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.76

Pray , Sir , let me ask you a Question . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.77

Mr. <font> Waterhouse <$$font> . Ay , if you please , Sir .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.78

<font> Oates <$$font> . Did you take Notes of that Trial you speak of ,
Sir ? OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.79

Mr. <font> Waterhouse <$$font> . No , I did not .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.80

<font> Oates <$$font> . How come you there to remember this , that I
was so positive as to the time betwixt the <font> 8_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> and <font> 12_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> of <font> August ? <$$font>
Mr. <font> Waterhouse <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.81

Because I was one of the Jury ; and because my Lord Chief Justice made a
stop , when you said , 't@ @was the <font> 12_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> of <font> August <$$font> ,
and bad you consider : OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.82

And you consider'd , and consider'd it OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.83

and did affirm positively , that it was between the <font> 8_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> and <font> 12_th
{COM:font_change_only_around_"th"} <$$font> of <font> August <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.84

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> He gives you a plain Reason for his
Remembrance . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.85

<font> Oates <$$font> . My Lord , I have done with him .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.86

<font> Mr. Sol. Gen. <$$font> Then we desire Mr. <font> Foster
<$$font> may be sworn . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.87

<bracket> <font> Which was done . <$$font> <$$bracket>
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.88

Mr. <font> Foster <$$font> , Pray will you tell what you remember Mr.
<font> Oates <$$font> swore at Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> 's Trial ,
about <font> Ireland <$$font> 's being in Town ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.89

Mr. <font> Foster <$$font> . I was one of the Jury at the Trial of Mr.
<font> Ireland <$$font> , Mr. <font> Pickering <$$font> , and Mr.
<font> Grove <$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.90

and I did see Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> sworn , as a Witness for the
King , at that Trial ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.91

and so was Mr. <font> Bedloe : <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.92

And <font> Bedloe <$$font> there gave Evidence , that there was a
Meeting at <font> Harcourt <$$font> 's Chamber ; and <font> Ireland
<$$font> , <font> Grove <$$font> , and <font> Pickering <$$font> were
there : And that this was the latter End of <font> August <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.93

Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> did make his Defence , as much as he could
, to prove , that he was not in Town from the Beginning of <font> August
<$$font> to the Middle of <font> September <$$font> ;
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.94

and brought divers Witnesses . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.95

But upon his denying to be here the latter End of <font> August <$$font>
, Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> did come and swear :
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.96

<font> I am certain <$$font> <paren> says he <$$paren> <font> that the
first and second of <$$font> September <font> he was in Town <$$font> ;
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.97

<font> for then I had of him Twenty Shillings <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.98

<font> Oates <$$font> . Was I positive , that he was here in Town the
1st or 2d of <font> September ? <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.99

- Mr. <font> Foster <$$font> . You were positive , Sir , to the 1st or
2d ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.100

I have it in my Notes in Writing . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.101

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> He tells you , it is in his Notes :
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.102

And therefore he@ @'s sure you said so . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.103

<font> Mr. Att. Gen. <$$font> In the printed Copy , if it be right ,
there is mention made of the Word <font> Positive <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.104

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I think , that is in <font> August <$$font>
, between the 8th or 12th , he was positive . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.105

<font> Oates <$$font> . Did I say these Words , <font> I was positive ?
<$$font> - Mr. <font> Waterhouse <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.106

I say , you affirmed that he was in Town the 1st or 2d of <font>
September <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.107

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> It is not necessary , that you should use
the Word <font> Positive : <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.108

The Question is , Whether it was positively affirmed ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.109

Mr. Just. <font> Withins <$$font> . Was not that true that you said ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.110

Did not you affirm a positive Truth ? OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.111

- <font> Oates <$$font> . My Lord , I@ @'ll tell you the Reason why I
ask the Question , because I have forgot myself , whether I used the
Word or no ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.112

and therefore I ask for my own Information now .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.113

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , ask for what Reason you will , you
have received an Answer to your Question ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.114

and upon my Word he gives a notable Evidence : OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.115

Says he , <font> Bedloe <$$font> had sworn a treasonable Practice by
<font> Ireland <$$font> , in the latter end of <font> August <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.116

Then <font> Ireland <$$font> comes , OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.117

and make {COM:sic} his Defence : OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.118

Says he , <font> That can@ @not be <$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.119

<font> for I was out of Town at that time <$$font> ;
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.120

<font> I was not in <$$font> London <font> all <$$font> August , <font>
nor the beginning of September <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.121

Then come you in to support the Testimony of <font> Bedloe <$$font> ,
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.122

and swear , that he was in Town the 1st or 2d of <font> September
<$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.123

for then he gave you twenty Shillings . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.124

And so you come to rivet the Matter that was sworn before by <font>
Bedloe <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.125

<font> Oates <$$font> . My Lord , what I swore was Truth .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.126

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That is now to be tried .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.127

<font> Mr. Att. Gen. <$$font> We have another of the Jury here , Mr.
<font> John Byfield : <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.128

Pray , swear him . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.129

<bracket> <font> Which was done <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.130

<font> Mr. Sol. Gen. <$$font> Well , Sir , what did you hear <font>
Oates <$$font> swear at that Trial ? OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.131

Mr. <font> Byfield <$$font> . I heard the same that they have
testified before . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.132

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But you must tell us what that was .
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.133

<font> Mr. Sol. Gen. <$$font> Were you a Jury-man at that Trial ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.134

Mr. <font> Byfield <$$font> . Yes , I had a Summons to the <font>
Old-Bailey <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.135

- <font> L. C. J. <$$font> But what did <font> Oates <$$font> swear ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.136

That@ @'s the Question . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,72.137

Mr. <font> Byfield <$$font> . Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> did

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Marry , if he did , he would contradict what

Days , and those uncertain : OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,77.290

What can you , Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> , say to it ?
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,79.444

I must needs tell you , <font> prima facie <$$font> , 't@ @is so strong

concerned at it . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,79.445

<font> Oates <$$font> . Not at all , my Lord ,
OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,79.446

And let it be remember'd what Credit he had then for all this Story he

These People come here to serve a turn only , OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,79.454

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You must hold your tongue .

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I think there is scarce a Word of Truth

<font> Oates <$$font> . You may think what you will , my Lord ;

but these Popish Traitors , I am sure will swear any thing , and suborn
Witnesses upon Witnesses against me to overthrow the Plot .

OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,79.510

<font> Oates <$$font> . I insist not so much upon the Question , but
only in reference to the Witness , his Acquaintance being so short with
him . OATES-1685-E3-P1,4,79.511

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Truly , I think it is not so very short ;
