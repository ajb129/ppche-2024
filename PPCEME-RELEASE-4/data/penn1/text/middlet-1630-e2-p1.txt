<P_9>

I walke out in a morning , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.3

come to breake-fast , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.4

Find excellent Cheere , a good Fier in Winter , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.5

Looke in my Coale-house about Midsommer-eeue , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.6

That@ @'s full , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.7

fiue or sixe Chaldorne , new layd vp , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.8

Looke in my backe yeard , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.9

I shall find a steeple Made vp with Kentish Fagots , which o're-lookes
The Water-House and the Wind-milles , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.10

I say nothing MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.11

But smile , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.12

and pin the doore , when she lyes in , As now she@ @'s euen vpon the
point of grunting , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.13

A Lady lyes not in like her , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.14

there@ @'s her imbossings , Embrodrings , spanglings , and I know not
what , As if she lay with all the gaudy Shops in <font> Gressams
<$$font> Bursse about her , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.15

then her restoratiues , Able to set vp a young Pothecarie , And richly
stocke , the Foreman of a Drug-shop . MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.16

Her Sugar by whole Loaues , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.17

her Wines by Rundlets . MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.18

I see these things , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.19

but like a happy Man , I pay for none at all , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.20

yet Fooles think@ @'s mine , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.21

I haue the name , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.22

and in his Gold I shine . MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.23

And where some Merchants would in Soule kisse Hell , To buy a Paradice
for their Wiues , and dye Their Conscience in the Bloods of prodigall
Heires , To decke their Night-peece , yet all this being done , Eaten
with iealousie to the inmost Bone , As what affliction Nature more
constraynes , Then feed the Wife plumpe , for anothers veynes . These
torments stand I freed of , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.24

I am as cleere From iealousie of a Wife , as from the charge .
MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,9.25

so to part That driues the torment to a knowing Heart ,
MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,13.154

But as thou say'st , we must giue way to need And liue awhile asunder ,
MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,13.155

our desires are both too fruitfull for our barren fortunes .
MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,13.156

How aduers runs the desteny of some Creatures ,
MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,13.157

Some onely can get riches and no Children , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,13.158

We onely can get Children and no riches , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,13.159

Then 't@ @is the prudents part to checke our willes , And till our state

A man@ @'s happy When he@ @'s at poorest that has match't his Soule As

Had I married A sensuall Foole now , as 't@ @is hard to scape it 'Mongst
Gentlewomen of our time , she would ha' hang'd About my Necke , and
neuer left her hold Till she had kist me into wanton businesses , Which
at the waking of my better Iudgement <P_14> I should haue curst most
bitterly , And layd a thicker vengance on my act Then miserie of the
Birth , which were enough If it were borne to greatnesse , whereas mine
Is sure of beggerie , though it were got in Wine .
MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,14.170

Fulnesse of Ioy sheweth the goodnesse in thee ,
MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,14.171

Had her desire beene wanton , they@ @'d beene blamelesse In being
lawfull euer , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,14.184

but of all Creatures I hold that Wife a most vnmatched treasure , That
can vnto her fortunes fixe her pleasure , And not vnto her Blood ,
MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,14.185

this is like wedlocke , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,14.186

The feast of marriage is not Lust but Loue , And care of the estate ,
MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,14.187

when I please Blood , Meerely I sing , MIDDLET-1630-E2-P1,14.188
