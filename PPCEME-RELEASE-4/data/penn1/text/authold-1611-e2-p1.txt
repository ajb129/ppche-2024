And the Lord appeared vnto him , in the plaines of Mamre :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.582

and he sate in the tent doore , in the heat of the day .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.583

2 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.584

And he lift vp his eyes AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.585

and bowed himselfe toward the ground , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.589

3 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.590

And said , My Lord , If now I haue found fauour in thy sight , pass not

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.591

And I will fetch a morsell of bread ; and comfort ye your hearts ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.597

For therefore are you come to your seruant .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.599

And they said ; So doe , as thou hast said .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.600

6 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.601

And Abraham hastened into the tent , vnto Sarah ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.602

& said ; Make ready quickly three measures of fine meale ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.603

knead <font> it <$$font> , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.604

and make cakes upon the hearth . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.605

7 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.606

And Abraham ranne vnto the heard , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.607

and fetcht a calfe , tender and good , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.608

and gaue it vnto a yong man : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.609

and he hasted to dresse it . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.610

8 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.611

And he tooke butter , and milke , and the calfe which he had dressed ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.612

and set it before them ; AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.613

and he stood by then vnder the tree : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.614

and they did eate . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.615

9 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.616

And they said vnto him , Where is Sarah thy wife ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.617

And he said , Behold , in the tent . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.618

10 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.619

And he said , I will certainly returne vnto thee according to the time

and loe , Sarah thy wife shall haue a sonne .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.621

And Sarah heard <font> it <$$font> in the tent doore , which was behind
him . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.622

11 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.623

Now Abraham and Sarah were old , and well stricken in age :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.624

<font> and <$$font> it ceased to be with Sarah after the maner of women
. AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.625

12 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.626

Therefore Sarah laughed within her selfe , saying , After I am waxed old
, shall I haue pleasure , my lord being old also ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.627

13 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.628

And the Lord said vnto Abraham , Wherefore did Sarah laugh , saying ;
Shall I of a surety beare a childe , which am old ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.629

14 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.630

Is any thing too hard for the Lord ? AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.631

At the time appointed will I returne vnto thee , according to the time
of life , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.632

and Sarah shall haue a sonne . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.633

15 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.634

Then Sarah denied , saying , I laughed not :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.635

for she was afraid . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.636

And he said , Nay , but thou diddest laugh .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.637

16 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.638

And the men rose vp from thence , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.639

and looked toward Sodome : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.640

and Abraham went with them , to bring them on the way .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.641

17 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.642

And the Lord said , Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I doe ;
18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation ,
and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.643

19 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.644

For I know him , that hee will command his children , and his household
after him , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.645

and they shall keepe the way of the Lord , to doe justice and judgement
, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham ; that which hee hath spoken of
him . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,1G.646

<P_18,20G>

20 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.648

And the Lord said , Because the cry of Sodome and Gomorrah is great ,
and because their sinne is very grieuous : 21 I will goe downe now , and
see whether they haue done altogether according to the cry of it , which
is come vnto me : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.649

and if not , I will know . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.650

22 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.651

And the men turned their faces from thence ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.652

and went toward Sodome : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.653

but Abraham stood yet before the Lord . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.654

23 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.655

And Abraham drew neere , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.656

and said , Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.657

24 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.658

Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the citie ;
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.659

wilt thou also destroy , and not spare the place for the fiftie
righteous , that are herein ? AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.660

25 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.661

That be farre from thee , to do after this maner , to slay the righteous
with the wicked , and that the righteous should be as the wicked ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.662

that be farre from thee : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.663

Shall not the Iudge of all the earth doe right ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.664

26 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.665

And the Lord said , If I find in Sodom fiftie righteous within the citie
, then I will spare all the place for their sakes .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.666

27 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.667

And Abraham answered , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.668

and said , Behold now , I haue taken vpon me to speake vnto the Lord ,
which am but dust and ashes . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.669

28 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.670

Peradventure there shall lacke fiue of the fiftie righteous :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.671

wilt thou destroy all the citie for <font> lacke <$$font> of fiue ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.672

And he said , If I find there fourtie_and_fiue , I will not destroy

29 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.674

And hee spake vnto him yet againe AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.675

and said , Peradventure there shall be fourtie found there :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.676

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.677

30 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.678

And he said vnto him , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speake

Peradventure there shall thirtie bee found there .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,18,20G.680

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.701

and he bowed himselfe with his face toward the ground .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.702

And they said , Nay : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.706

but we wil abide in the street all night . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.707

3 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.708

And he pressed upon them greatly , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.709

and they turned in vnto him , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.710

and entred into his house : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.711

and he made them a feast , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.712

and did bake vnleauened bread , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.713

and they did eate . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.714

But before they lay downe , the men of the citie , <font> euen <$$font>
the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both old and yong , all
the people from euery quarter . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.716

And they called vnto Lot , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.718

and said vnto him , Where are the men which came in to thee this night ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.719

bring them out vnto vs , that we may know them .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.720

6 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.721

And Lot went out at the doore vnto them , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.722

& shut the doore after him , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.723

And said , I pray you , brethren , doe not so wickedly .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.725

8 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.726

Behold now , I haue two daughters , which haue not knowen man ;
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.727

let mee , I pray you , bring them out vnto you ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.728

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.729

onely vnto these men do nothing : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.730

for therefore came they vnder the shadow of my roofe .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.731

9 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.732

And they said , Stand backe . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.733

And they said againe , This one <font> fellow <$$font> came in to

and he will needs bee a Iudge : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.735

Now wil we deale worse with thee , then with them .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.736

And they pressed sore upon the man , <font> euen <$$font> Lot ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.737

and came neere to breake the doore . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.738

10 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.739

But the men put forth their hand , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.740

and pulled Lot into the house to them , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.741

and shut to the doore . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.742

11 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.743

And they smote the men that <font> were <$$font> at the doore of the
house , with blindnes , both small and great : so that they wearied
themselues to finde the doore . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.744

12 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.745

And the men said vnto Lot , Hast thou here any besides ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.746

sonne in law , and thy sonnes , and thy daughters , and whatsoeuer thou
hast in the citie , bring <font> them <$$font> out of this place .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.747

13 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.748

For we will destroy this place , because the crie of them is waxen great
before the face of the Lord : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.749

and the Lord hath sent vs to destroy it . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.750

14 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.751

And Lot went out , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.752

and spake vnto his sonnes in law , which married his daughters ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.753

and said , Vp , get yee out of this place : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.754

for the Lord wil destroy this citie : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.755

but hee seemed as one that mocked , vnto his sonnes in law .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.756

15 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.757

And when the morning arose , then the Angels hastened Lot , saying ,
Arise , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.758

take thy wife , & thy two daughters , which are here , lest thou be
consumed in the iniquitie of the citie . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.759

16 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.760

And while he lingred , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the
hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two daughters , the Lord
being mercifull vnto him : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.761

and they brought him forth , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.762

and set him without the citie . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.763

17 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.764

And it came to passe , when they had brought them forth abroad , that he
said , Escape for thy life , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.765

looke not behind thee , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.766

neither stay thou in all the plaine : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.767

escape to the mountaine , lest thou bee consumed .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.768

18 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.769

And Lot said vnto them , Oh not so , my Lord .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.770

19 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.771

Beholde now , thy seruant hath found grace in thy sight ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.772

and thou hast magnified thy mercy , which thou hast shewed vnto me , in
sauing my life , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.773

and I can@ @not escape to the mountaine , lest some euill take me , and
I die . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,1G.774

<P_19,20G>

20 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.776

Behold now , this citie is neere to flee vnto ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.777

and it is a litle one : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.778

Oh let me escape thither , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.779

<paren> is it not a litle one ? <$$paren> AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.780

and my soule shall liue . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.781

21 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.782

And he said vnto him , See , I haue accepted thee concerning this thing
, that I will not ouerthrow this citie , for the which thou hast spoken
. AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.783

22 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.784

Haste thee , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.785

escape thither : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.786

for I can@ @not doe any thing till thou bee come thither :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.787

therefore the name of the citie was called Zoar .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.788

23 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.789

The sunne was risen upon the earth , when Lot entred into Zoar .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.790

24 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.791

Then the Lord rained upon Sodome & upon Gomorrah , brimstone and fire ,
from the Lord out of heauen . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.792

25 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.793

And he ouerthrew those cities , and all the plaine , and all the
inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.794

26 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.795

But his wife looked backe from behind him ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.796

and she became a pillar of salt . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.797

27 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.798

And Abraham gate vp earely in the morning , to the place , where hee
stood before the Lord . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.799

28 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.800

And he looked toward Sodome and Gomorrah , & toward all the land of the
plaine , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.801

and beheld , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.802

and loe , the smoke of the countrey went vp as the smoke of a furnace .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.803

29 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.804

And it came to passe , when God destroyed the cities of the plaine ,
that God remembred Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the
ouerthrow , when he ouerthrew the cities , in the which Lot dwelt .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.805

30 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.806

And Lot went vp out of Zoar , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.807

and dwelt in the mountaine , and his two daughters with him :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.808

for hee feared to dwell in Zoar , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.809

and he dwelt in a caue , he and his two daughters .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.810

31 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.811

And the first borne saide vnto the yonger , Our father is old ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.812

and there is not a man in the earth , to come in vnto vs , after the
maner of all the earth . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.813

Come , let vs make our father drinke wine ,

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.821

35 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.827

And they made their father drink wine that night also ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.828

and the yonger arose , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.829

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.831

36 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.832

Thus were both the daughters of Lot with childe by their father .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,19,20G.833

And Abraham iourneyed from thence , toward the South-Countrey ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.848

and dwelled betweene Cadesh and Shur , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.849

and soiourned in Gerar . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.850

2 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.851

And Abraham said of Sarah his wife , She is my sister :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.852

And Abimelech King of Gerar sent , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.853

and tooke Sarah . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.854

3 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.855

But God came to Abimelech in a dreame by night ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.856

and said to him , Behold , thou <font> art but <$$font> a dead man , for
the woman which thou hast taken : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.857

for shee is a mans wife . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.858

4 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.859

But Abimelech had not come neere her : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.860

and he said , Lord , wilt thou slay also a righteous nation ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.861

5 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.862

Said he not vnto me , She is my sister ? AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.863

and she , euen she herselfe said , Hee is my brother :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.864

in the integritie of my heart , and innocencie of my hands haue I done
this . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.865

6 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.866

And God saide vnto him in a dreame , Yea , I know that thou didst this
in the integritie of thy heart : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.867

for I also withheld thee from sinning against mee ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.868

therefore suffered I thee not to touch her .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.869

7 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.870

Now therefore restore the man his wife : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.871

for he is a Prophet , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.872

and he shal pray for thee , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.873

and thou shalt liue : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.874

and if thou restore her not , know thou that thou shalt surely die ,
thou , and all that are thine . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.875

8 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.876

Therefore Abimelech rose earely in the morning ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.877

and called all his seruants , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.878

and told all these things in their eares : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.879

and the men were sore afraid . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.880

9 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.881

Then Abimelech called Abraham , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.882

and said vnto him , What hast thou done vnto vs ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.883

and what haue I offended thee , that thou hast brought on me , and on my
kingdome a great sinne ? AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.884

thou hast done deeds vnto mee that ought not to be done .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.885

10 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.886

this thing ? AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.887

11 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.888

And Abraham said , Because I thought , Surely the feare of God is not in
this place : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.889

and they will slay me for my wiues sake . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.890

12 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.891

And yet indeed shee is my sister : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.892

she <font> is <$$font> the daughter of my father , but not the daughter
of my mother ; AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.893

and shee became my wife . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.894

13 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P1,20,1G.895

And it came to passe when God caused me to wander from my fathers house
, that I said vnto her , This is thy kindnesse which thou shall show

at euery place whither wee shall come , say of me , He is my brother .
