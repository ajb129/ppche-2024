<BEGIN_lisle-1685-e3-p1>

<P_4,107>

The Method wherein we shall give our Evidence , will be this ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.3

we shall first begin with this piece of Evidence , that we shall prove ,
that <font> Hicks <$$font> was actually in the Army , and in the
Rebellion ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.4

and then we shall prove the several subsequent Facts as have been opened
. LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.5

We desire Mr. <font> Pope <$$font> , Mr. <font> Fitzherbert <$$font> ,
and Mr. <font> Taylor <$$font> may be sworn . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.6

<font> Lisle <$$font> . My Lord , as for what is said concerning the
Rebellion , I can assure you , I abhorr'd that Rebellion as much as any
Woman in the world - LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.7

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Look you , Mrs. <font> Lisle <$$font> ,
because we must observe the common and usual Methods of Trial in your
Case , as well as others , I must interupt you now :
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.8

You shall be fully heard when it comes to your turn to make your Defence
, LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.9

but any thing you say now beforehand is altogether irregular and
improper . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.10

You , it may be , are ignorant of the Forms of Law ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.11

therefore I would inform you : LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.12

You are first to hear what your Accusation is ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.13

you shall ask any Questions of the Witnesses that you will , after the
King's Counsel have examin'd them , as they go along ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.14

and when all their Testimony is delivered , you shall be heard to make
your own Defence , and have full scope and Liberty to inlarge upon it as
long as you can : LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.15

it is a business that concerns you in point of Life and Death ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.16

all that you have or can value in the World lies at stake ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.17

and God forbid that you should be hinder'd either in time or any thing
else , whereby you may defend yourself ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.18

but at present it is not your turn to speak , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.19

for the Forms of Law require your Accusers first to be heard ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.20

and it is absolutely requisite , that the usual Forms and Methods of Law
be inviolably observ'd , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.21

and be sure it does the Prisoner no injury that the Law is kept so
strictly to ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.22

and we have that Charity , as well as Justice , that it becomes , and is
not below all Courts to have for Persons in your Condition ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.23

and we are obliged to take care , that you suffer no Detriment or Injury
by any illegal or irregular Proceedings . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.24

For tho' we sit here as Judges over you by Authority from the King , yet
we are accountable , not only to him , but to the King of Kings , the
great Judge of Heaven and Earth ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.25

and therefore are obliged , both by our Oaths , and upon our Consciences
, to do you Justice , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.26

and by the Grace of God we shall do it , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.27

you may depend upon it . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.28

And as to what you say concerning yourself , I pray God with all my
heart you may be innocent . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.29

Pray call your Witnesses . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.30

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font> . Swear Mr. <font> Pope <$$font> , Mr.
<font> Fitzherbert <$$font> , and Mr. <font> Taylor <$$font> .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.31

<bracket> <font> Which was done . <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.32

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who do you begin with ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.33

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font> . Mr. <font> Pope <$$font> , pray will
you tell my Lord and the Jury , what you know concerning this <font>
Hicks ? <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.34

Pray tell your whole Knowledge . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.35

Mr. <font> Pope <$$font> . My Lord , I had the misfortune to be taken
Prisoner by <font> Monmouth's <$$font> Army , going about some Business
of my own ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.36

and after I had been taken some few days , we happened to be brought to
<font> Keinsham <$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.37

and we were put into Sir <font> Thomas Bridge's <$$font> Stables , and
kept under a Guard there . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.38

Whilst we were there , I did see that Gentleman that goes by the Name of
Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font> , who is now in <font> Salisbury <$$font>
Goal , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.39

and there I saw him yesterday ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.40

he came LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.41

and asked for the Prisoners , which were about four or five in number ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.42

and he asked them , how they did ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.43

They made him little reply . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.44

Then he desired to know how we were dealt with , whether he were kindly
used , or no ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.45

I replied , no , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.46

for we had had but a piece of Bread these two Days .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.47

He made me answer , that he was sorry for that ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.48

for it was otherwise intended . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.49

And there was with him another Gentleman that was called the King's
Chaplain , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.50

that is , the Duke of <font> Monmouth@ @'s <$$font> ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.51

and afterwards he pretended he would do us a Kindness in speaking to the
King <paren> as he called him <$$paren> for us .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.52

He talked with us some little time , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.53

and by and by he began to ask us , what was the reason that we were
there ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.54

We told him we were taken Prisoners ; upon which , saith he , this King
<paren> meaning , as I suppose , the late Duke of <font> Monmouth
<$$font> <$$paren> is a good King and a Protestant ; and a great deal to
that purpose , with some reflecting Words on the Government , and upon
the Person of the King : LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.55

and he told us , he wondered what we had to say for ourselves , being
Protestants , that we did what we did in serving a Popish Prince , and
not obeying a Protestant one . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.56

This is the Substance of what I have to say upon this matter .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.57

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Tho' you were pleased to phrase it , Sir ,
in the beginning of your Testimony , a Misfortune that you were taken
Prisoner by the Rebels ; yet , I suppose , you could not be without the
Consolation of a good Conscience , that you suffered in the way of doing
your Duty . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.58

Mr. <font> Pope <$$font> . My Lord , I am very well satisfied I did
suffer in a good Cause . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,107.59

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> There is one piece of happiness in it ; that
by that means <P_4,108> you are able to give this Testimony this day ,
and do the King this piece of Service . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.60

But pray , Sir , let me ask you this Question :
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.61

Are you sure the Man you saw yesterday at <font> Salisbury <$$font> is
the same Man that you spoke with at <font> Keinsham <$$font> , that goes
by the Name of <font> Hicks ? <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.62

Mr. <font> Pope <$$font> . Yes , my Lord ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.63

and when I was there yesterday with him , I asked him , whether he knew
me ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.64

and told him , said I , you may well remember you saw me at <font>
Keinsham <$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.65

Saith he , I do not remember that ever I saw your Face before .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.66

Said I , you remember Sir <font> Thomas Bridge's <$$font> Stables there
? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.67

Said he , I remember I did see some Prisoners .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.68

Said I , was not it there you saw me , and had such a Discourse with me
? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.69

He seemed to deny it , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.70

but I told him , a Man of your Coat should not tell Untruth ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.71

you can@ @not but remember you saw me there . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.72

Saith he , I will recollect my Memory if I can ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.73

and he afterwards sent to the <font> George <$$font> in <font> Salisbury
<$$font> for me , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.74

and then he told me , he did recollect that he saw and talked with such
a Person there . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.75

Mr. <font> Rumsey <$$font> . Sir , I would ask you this one Question ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.76

did you see him in the Army about the time of the Fight ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.77

Mr. <font> Pope <$$font> . I think I saw him about a day or two before
. LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.78

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Had he any Weapon on ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.79

- Mr. <font> Pope <$$font> . I think not , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.80

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font> . Our next Witness is Mr. <font>
Fitzherbert <$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.81

Pray , Sir , will you give an account to my Lord and the Jury , what you
know of this <font> Hicks <$$font> ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.82

Mr. <font> Fitzherbert <$$font> . My Lord , during the time that I was
a Prisoner with this Gentleman at <font> Keinsham <$$font> , the 25th of
<font> June <$$font> , I saw this Man , <font> John Hicks <$$font> , who
held a Discourse with Mr. <font> Pope <$$font> near an Hour's time ,
disparaging the Government and his Majesty , and extolling the Duke of
<font> Monmouth <$$font> , what a brave Prince , and how good a
Protestant he was . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.83

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then he was among them , was he ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.84

Mr. <font> Fitzherbert <$$font> . Yes , my Lord , he was ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.85

and I saw him yesterday at <font> Salisbury <$$font> .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.86

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Is that the same Man that you saw in <font>
Monmouth's <$$font> Army ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.87

Mr. <font> Fitzherbert <$$font> . Yes , he owns himself to be the same
Man . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.88

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font> . How often did you see him there
besides that time when he discoursed with Mr. <font> Pope ? <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.89

Mr. <font> Fitzherbert <$$font> . I saw him sometimes out of the Town
, LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.90

but I never discoursed him {COM:sic} . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.91

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you see him there before or after that
Discourse ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.92

Mr. <font> Fitzherbert <$$font> . It was after .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.93

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Would the Prisoner ask this Witness , or the
other , any Questions ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.94

- <font> Lisle <$$font> . No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.95

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font> . Then , Mr. <font> Taylor <$$font> ,
what say you to the matter ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.96

Mr. <font> Taylor <$$font> . My Lord , I saw him at the same time that
these Gentlemen speak of at Sir <font> Thomas Bridge's <$$font> , at
<font> Keinsham <$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.97

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font> . Were you a Prisoner there , Sir ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.98

Mr. <font> Taylor <$$font> . Yes , I was . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.99

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font> . What Place was it you saw him in ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.100

Mr. <font> Taylor <$$font> . It was in the Stables the first time that
I saw him . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.101

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Discourse had you with him ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.102

What did he say to you ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.103

Mr. <font> Taylor <$$font> . He said , he wonder'd at us , that we
should take up Arms against so good a Prince , and a Protestant , as the
Duke of <font> Monmouth <$$font> , and against the Protestant Religion ,
and hold up with Popery : LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.104

Saith he , <font> York <$$font> is but a Papist ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.105

and a great many such Words . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.106

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you see him afterwards ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.107

Mr. <font> Taylor <$$font> . Yes , my Lord ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.108

but I can@ @not tell particularly the Time and Place ; up and down the
Army . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.109

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you see him at <font> Salisbury ?
<$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.110

- Mr. <font> Taylor <$$font> . Yes . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.111

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Is that the same Man ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.112

- Mr. <font> Taylor <$$font> . Yes , it is .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.113

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font> . Next , my Lord , we come to prove the
Message and Correspondence between this same <font> Hicks <$$font> , and
the Prisoner Mrs. <font> Lisle . <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.114

Mr. <font> Jennings <$$font> . Swear Mr. <font> James Dunne <$$font>
. LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.115

<bracket> <font> Which was done <$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.116

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font> . If your Lordship please to observe ,
the Times will fall out to be very material in this Case :
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.117

The Battle at <font> King <$$font> 's <font> Edgmore <$$font> was the
6th of <font> July <$$font> ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.118

three or four days after was the taking of <font> Monmouth <$$font> ,
and my Lord <font> Grey <$$font> at <font> Ringwood <$$font> ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.119

upon the 26th of <font> July <$$font> , ten or twelve Days after the
taking of <font> Monmouth <$$font> , was this Message sent by <font>
Dunne <$$font> to Mrs. <font> Lisle <$$font> :
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.120

so we call <font> Dunne <$$font> to prove what Message he carried upon
the 26th , and what Answer was return'd ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.121

he will tell you , that <font> Tuesday <$$font> was the time appointed
for them to come , in the Night , and all the other Circumstances .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.122

But withal , I must acquaint your Lordship , that this Fellow , <font>
Dunne <$$font> , is a very unwilling Witness ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.123

and therefore , with submission to your Lordship , we do humbly desire
your Lordship would please to examine him a little the more strictly .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.124

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You say well : LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.125

Hark you , Friend , I would take notice of something to you by the way ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.126

and you would do well to mind what I say to you .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.127

According as the Counsel that are here for the King seem to insinuate ,
you were employ'd as a Messenger between these Persons , one whereof has
already been proved a notorious Rebel , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.128

and the other is the Prisoner at the Bar , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.129

and your Errand was to procure a Reception at her House for him .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.130

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I did so .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.131

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Very well . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.132

Now mark what I say to you , Friend : LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.133

I would not by any means in the world endeavour to fright you into any
thing , or any ways tempt you to tell an Untruth , but provoke you to
tell the Truth , and nothing but the Truth , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.134

that is the Business we come about here . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.135

Know , Friend , there is no Religion that any man can pretend to , can
give a Countenance to Lying , or can dispense with telling the Truth :
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.136

Thou hast a precious immortal Soul , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.137

and there is nothing in the World equal to it in value :
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.138

There is no relation to thy Mistress , if she be so ; no relation to thy
Friend ; nay , to thy Father or thy Child ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.139

nay , not all the temporal Relations in the world can be equal to thy
precious immortal Soul . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.140

Consider that that Great God of Heaven and Earth , before whose Tribunal
thou , and we , and all Persons are to stand at the last Day , will call
thee to an account for the rescinding his Truth , and take vengeance of
thee for every Falshood thou tellest . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.141

I charge thee , therefore as thou wilt answer it to the great God , the
Judge of all the Earth , that thou do not dare to waver one tittle from
the Truth , upon any account or pretence whatsoever :
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.142

For tho' it were to save thy Life , yet the value of thy precious and
immortal Soul is much greater , than that thou should'st forfeit it for
the saving of any the most precious outward Blessing thou dost enjoy ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,108.143

for that God of Heaven may justly strike thee into eternal Flames , and
make thee drop into the bottomless Lake of Fire and Brimstone , if thou
offer to deviate the least from the Truth , <P_4,109> and nothing but
the Truth . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.144

According to the Command of that Oath that thou hast taken , tell us who
employ'd you , when you were employ'd and were ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.145

Who caus'd you to go on this Message , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.146

and what was the Message {SIC:the_Message_was} ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.147

For I tell thee God is not to be mock'd , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.148

and thou can'st not deceive him , tho' thou may'st us .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.149

But I assure you , if I catch you prevaricating in any the last tittle
<paren> and perhaps I know more than you think I do ; no , none of your
Saints can save your Soul , nor shall they save your Body neither
<$$paren> I will be sure to punish every variation from the Truth that
you are guilty of . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.150

Now come LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.151

and tell us , how you came to be employ'd on such a Message , what your
Errand was , and what was the Issue and Result of it ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.152

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , there came a Man to my House ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.153

and desired me to go of a Message to my Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s <$$font>
. LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.154

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pri@ @thee tell me when it was ? And what
Hour of the Day ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.155

<font> Dunne <$$font> . What , when the Man came to my House ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.156

- <font> L. C. J. <$$font> Yes . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.157

<font> Dunne <$$font> . That I will , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.158

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Be sure you do , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.159

and do not speak one word but what is true , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.160

and let the Truth come out o' God's Name . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.161

<font> Dunne <$$font> . It was <font> Friday <$$font> Night .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,109.162

I@ @'ll repeat it to thee , because thou shalt see that I remember it

It seems that a Man , a short black Man came to your House in <font>
Warminster <$$font> Parish to get you to go for a Message to Mrs.
<font> Lisle's <$$font> , to know whether she would entertain one <font>
Hicks <$$font> ; and that you went upon the <font> Saturday <$$font> ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.263

and ask'd him the Question , whether his Lady would entertain one Mr.
<font> Hicks ? <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.265

and he told you he would have nothing to do with it ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.266

and thereupon you went to Mrs. <font> Lisle <$$font> ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.267

and asked her the Question , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.268

<font> Tuesday <$$font> following , and come in the Evening , and she
would entertain him : LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.269

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I do not remember any thing more .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.273

<font> Dunne <$$font> . I can@ @not tell truly .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.279

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why , dost thou think she would entertain
any one that she had no Knowledge of merely upon thy Message ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.280

Mr. <font> Dunne <$$font> , Mr. <font> Dunne <$$font> , have a care ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.281

it may be more is known of this matter than you think for .

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , I only bid you have a care ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.287

Truth never wants a Subterfuge , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.288

it always loves to appear naked , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.289

it needs no Enamel , nor any Covering ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.290

but Lying and Sniveling , and Canting , and Hicksing , always appear in
Masquerade . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.291

Come , go on with your Evidence . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.292

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I say I went back again and returned
my Answer to the same Man that brought the Message to me .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.293

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pray let me ask you one Question ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.294

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How didst thou find the way when thou
wentest on thy Message first ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.335

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , after I came to <font>
Salisbury-Plain <$$font> , I met with one <font> Barter <$$font> ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.336

and he shewed me the way . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.337

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Where is that <font> Barter ? <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.338

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font> . My Lord , we have him here ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.339

we shall examine him by and by , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.340

there he stands . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.341

<bracket> <font> Being a very lusty Man . <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.342

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Sure that was not the little Man thou
spokest of ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.343

<font> Dunne <$$font> . No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.344

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pri@ @thee let me understand thee then , if
I can . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.345

Thou didst say at first there was only a little Man with a black Beard ,
that was concerned with thee about that Message ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.346

now thou talkest of some Guide that thou hadst ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.347

pri@ @thee who did guide thee , let us know ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.348

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I say I went so far as <font> Fovant
<$$font> , and so to <font> Chalk <$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.349

but when I came upon the <font> Plain <$$font> , I did not know my way
to my Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s <$$font> House at <font> Moyle's Court
<$$font> ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.350

I asked twenty People in the Street which was my way ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.351

but no body would tell me ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.352

at last I spoke to one <font> John Barter <$$font> to go with me to my
Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s <$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.353

and he and I did agree to go together , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.354

and he shewed me the way LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.355

and carried me to the House . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.356

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou shouldst have told us this before , Man
, that we might have understood it . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.357

Where did you lie upon the <font> Saturday <$$font> Night ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,110.358

<P_4,111>

<font> Dunne <$$font> . At <font> Fovant <$$font> .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.360

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I thought you had said , you had come to
Mrs. <font> Lisle's <$$font> on <font> Saturday ? <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.361

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Yes , my Lord , I did so ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.362

and came back to <font> Fovant <$$font> that Night .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.363

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And where did you lie on <font> Sunday
<$$font> Night ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.364

<font> Dunne <$$font> . I lay at my own House on <font> Sunday <$$font>
Night . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.365

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And <font> Barter <$$font> came along with
you when you came on <font> Tuesday ? <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.366

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Yes , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.367

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And did you go the same way upon the <font>
Tuesday <$$font> that you went upon the <font> Saturday ? <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.368

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Do you mean , my Lord , the same way I came at
first ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.369

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.370

<font> Dunne <$$font> . No , my Lord , we came to <font> Sutton
<$$font> , not to <font> Fovant <$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.371

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why did not you go the same way upon the
<font> Tuesday <$$font> that you went upon the <font> Saturday ?
<$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.372

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Because I had appointed to meet him at such a
Place . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.373

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Come , pri@ @thee answer me freely , and
according to Truth : LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.374

Who did desire thee , or order thee to go another way than that thou
went'st at first ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.375

How came it to pass ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.376

Let us know the Truth ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.377

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I did count that to be the nearer way
, LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.378

and therefore I went that way . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.379

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That can@ @not be the Reason ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.380

for thou wouldst have gone the nearest way at first , I believe ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.381

come , tell us truly ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.382

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I know no other Reason .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.383

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Come , tell us what Towns and Villages you
did go through then upon <font> Saturday ? <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.384

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I went through several , <font>
Chilmark <$$font> and <font> Fovant <$$font> .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.385

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And what Villages did you go through upon
the <font> Tuesday ? <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.386

<font> Dunne <$$font> . I went through most of the same Towns .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.387

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What , and at Noon-day too ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.388

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . Yes . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.389

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And how chanc'd when you went that way ,
that you appointed <font> Barter <$$font> to meet you in another Place
at <font> Fovant ? <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.390

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Because I did not know the way afterwards .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.391

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then let me ask you another Question :
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.392

Did you go the same way from <font> Fovant <$$font> to my Lady <font>
Lisle@ @'s <$$font> as you went before ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.393

<font> Dunne <$$font> . No , we did not . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.394

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How came that to pass ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.395

<font> Dunne <$$font> . I would have went the same way ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.396

but they would not . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.397

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Which way did you go then ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.398

<font> Dunne <$$font> . We went through <font> Chalk <$$font> , and so
thro <font> Rockshorne <$$font> , and from <font> Rockshorne <$$font> to
<font> Fording-Bridge <$$font> , and so to <font> Moyle's <$$font>
<font> Court <$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.399

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How far is this about now ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.400

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Truly , my Lord I can@ @not readily tell .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.401

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How many Miles is it from <font> Fovant
<$$font> to Lady <font> Lisle's <$$font> ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.402

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , it is about fourteen or fifteen .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.403

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How many Miles was it the way that you went
upon the <font> Tuesday ? <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.404

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . It might be twenty , my Lord , for aught I
know . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.405

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What was the Reason that <font> Barter
<$$font> went that way ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.406

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Truly , my Lord , I can@ @not tell .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.407

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pray let me ask you another Question then ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.408

What Discourse had you with <font> Barter ? <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.409

Or what Bargain did you make with him for shewing you the way ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.410

For you would not ask him to go with you without promising him some
Reward . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.411

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I asked him to shew me the way to my
Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s <$$font> House , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.412

and told him I was going for one <font> Hicks <$$font> ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.413

and so he took his Horse LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.414

and went with me . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.415

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Reward did you promise him ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.416

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Half-@ @a-@ @Crown , my Lord ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.417

and Half-@ @a-@ @Crown I gave him . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.418

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , that was the first time ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.419

and what did you promise him the second time ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.420

<font> Dunne <$$font> . The second time one of the two Men gave him
five Shillings . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.421

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Man was it ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.422

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . It was the black Man .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.423

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What was his Name ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.424

It was not the little black Man that came first to desire you to go on
the Message , was it ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.425

<font> Dunne <$$font> . No , my Lord , it was not he that spoke to me
first . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.426

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not that little Man that spoke to you
first promise you a Reward for your Pains ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.427

<font> Dunne <$$font> . No , my Lord , that Man never promised me any
thing . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.428

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did he go along with you ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.429

<font> Dunne <$$font> . No , my Lord , he did not .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.430

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who were the two Men that went with you ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.431

<font> Dunne <$$font> ... {SIC:..} <font> Hicks <$$font> and <font>
Nelthorp <$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.432

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Which of them two was it that gave <font>
Barter <$$font> five Shillings ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.433

<font> Dunne <$$font> . It was <font> Nelthorp <$$font> that gave him
five Shillings . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.434

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How do you know his Name was <font> Nelthorp
? <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.435

<font> Dunne <$$font> . At my Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s <$$font> , after
he was taken , I knew his Name to be <font> Nelthorp <$$font> .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.436

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Name did go by before ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.437

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Were I to die presently , my Lord , I can@ @not
tell it . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.438

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , you went so much about :
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.439

What time did you get to my Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s <$$font> upon the
<font> Tuesday ? <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.440

<font> Dunne <$$font> . About nine or ten of the Clock at Night , my
Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.441

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Let us consider a little ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.442

LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.443

LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.444

<font> Dunne <$$font> . About two or three of the Clock , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.445

<font> Dunne <$$font> . No where , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.447

LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.448

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . Yes , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.449

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was it before nine , or after nine that you
came to my Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s <$$font> ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.450

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . I believe it was rather after nine . My Lord
. LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.451

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who came first to my Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s
<$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.452

pri@ @thee tell us frankly ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.453

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , we came all three together to the
Gate . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.454

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who knocked at the Gate , you or <font>
Barter <$$font> , or who else ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.455

<font> Dunne <$$font> . <font> Barter <$$font> , my Lord was discharg'd
before we came near the House , about eight Miles from it .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.456

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Say'st thou so ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.457

How came you then to know the way without him ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.458

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I@ @'ll tell you ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.459

they lost their way , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,111.460

and they sent me <P_4,112> down to <font> Marton <$$font> ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.461

and there I went to a Man , my Lord , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.462

and told him one <font> Hicks <$$font> desired to speak with him .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.463

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou say'st well ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.464

now must I know that Man's Name . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.465

<font> Dunne <$$font> . The Man's Name that I went to at <font> Marton
<$$font> , my Lord ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.466

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Yes , and look to it , you tell me right ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.467

for it may be I know the Man already , and can tell at what end of the
Town the Man lives too . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.468

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I can@ @not tell his Name presently .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.469

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> O ! pray now , do not say so ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.470

you must tell us , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.471

indeed you must think of his Name at little .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.472

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , if I can mind it I will .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.473

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pri@ @thee do . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.474

<font> Dunne <$$font> . His Name , truly , my Lord , I can@ @not
rightly tell for the present . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.475

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pri@ @thee recollect thyself ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.476

indeed thou canst tell us if thou wilt . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.477

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I can go to the House again if I were
at liberty . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.478

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I believe it , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.479

and so could I ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.480

but really neither you nor I can be spared at present ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.481

therefore pri@ @thee do us the kindness now to tell us his {SIC:him}
Name . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.482

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Truly , my Lord , I can@ @not mind his Name at
present . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.483

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Alack-a-day , we must needs have it !
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.484

Come , refresh your Memory a little . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.485

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I think his Name was <font> Fane
<$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.486

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou say'st right ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.487

his Name was <font> Fane <$$font> truly , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.488

thou seest I know something of the matter : LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.489

Well , what didst thou say to him ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.490

<font> Dunne <$$font> . I told him I came from one Mr. <font> Hicks
<$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.491

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And what didst thou desire of him ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.492

<font> Dunne <$$font> . I told him that one Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font>
desired to speak with him ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.493

and when he came out to Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font> , Mr. <font> Hicks
<$$font> did desire him to shew him the way to Mrs. <font> Lisle's
<$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.494

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Now tell us what kind of Man that was , that
did desire this of Mr. <font> Fane ? <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.495

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , it was the full fat black Man .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.496

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Now we have got him out ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.497

now we know which was <font> Hicks : <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.498

Now go on . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.499

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , this Man went and rid along with them
as far as the new House that is built there , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.500

within a Mile of that House <font> Fane <$$font> went along with us ;

and afterwards , whether <font> Hicks <$$font> or <font> Nelthorp
<$$font> , or who knew the way , I can@ @not tell ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.502

but to my Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s <$$font> we went .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.503

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who directed you the way when <font> Fane
<$$font> left you ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.504

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I can@ @not tell ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.505

for my part I did not know the way . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.506

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who went with you ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.507

<font> Dunne <$$font> . None but <font> Hicks <$$font> and <font>
Nelthorp <$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.508

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How far from my Lady's House was that place
where <font> Fane <$$font> left you ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.509

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I can@ @not directly tell .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.510

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then <font> Hicks <$$font> knew the way , it
seems , from thence ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.511

<font> Dunne <$$font> . So he might , my Lord , for aught I know ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.512

for I did not . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.513

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou art strangely stiff ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.514

but now we are come thus far with you , tell me what Entertainment you
had at my Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s <$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.515

and look to it that you be sure to tell me Truth ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.516

for I know it to a tittle , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.517

I can assure you that . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.518

<font> Dunne <$$font> . They went in before me , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.519

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who went in before you ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.520

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.521

<font> Hicks <$$font> and Nelthorp . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.522

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.523

But the Door was shut when you came , was it not ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.524

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I can@ @not tell truly .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.525

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then tell me what Entertainment you had
there ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.526

<font> Dunne <$$font> . For my own part , my Lord , I carry'd a bit of
Cake and Cheese from my own House , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.527

and that I eat . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.528

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What became of your Companions <font> Hicks
<$$font> , and <font> Nelthorp <$$font> , I pray you ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.529

<font> Dunne <$$font> . I never saw them again till after they were
taken . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.530

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How is that , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.531

pri@ @thee recollect thyself ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.532

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Sure , my Lord , I did not see them till then .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.533

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who came to the Door to you ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.534

<font> Dunne <$$font> . A young Girl , my Lord ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.535

I knew not who nor what she was . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.536

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did they go directly into the House ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.537

<font> Dunne <$$font> . It was dark , my Lord ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.538

I did not see what they did . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.539

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was there never a Candle there ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.540

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.541

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> It was dark , very dark , was it not ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.542

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Yes , my Lord , it was so .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.543

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was my Lady stirring then ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.544

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . I did not see her .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.545

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And this is as much as you know of the
Business ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.546

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Yes , my Lord , this is all that I remember .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.547

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well ; and what hadst thou for all thy pains
? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.548

<font> Dunne <$$font> . Nothing but a Month's Imprisonment , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.549

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou seemest to be a Man of a great deal of
Kindness and Good-nature ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.550

for , by this Story , there was a Man that thou never sawest before
<paren> for I would fain have all People observe what Leather some Men's
Consciences are made of <$$paren> LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.551

and because he only had a black Beard , and came to thy House , that
black Beard of his should persuade thee to go 26 Miles , and give a Man
half a Crown out of thy Pocket to shew thee thy way , and all to carry a
Message from a Man thou never knewest in thy Life , to a Woman whom thou
never sawest in thy Life neither ; LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.552

that thou should'st lie out by the way two Nights , and upon the <font>
Sunday <$$font> get home , and there meet with this same black-bearded
little Gentleman , and appoint these People to come to thy House upon
the <font> Tuesday <$$font> ; and when they came , entertain them three
or four Hours at thy own House , and go back again so many Miles with
them , and have no Entertainment but a piece of Cake and Cheese that
thou broughtest thyself from home , and have no Reward , nor so much as
know any of the Persons thou didst all this for , is very strange .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.553

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , the Man that came to desire me to go
on this Message , said that <font> Hicks <$$font> should reward me , and
pay me for my pains . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.554

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But why wouldst thou take the word of a Man
thou didst not know ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.555

<font> Dunne <$$font> . I was forced to take his word at that time , my
Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.556

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> There was no necessity for that neither ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.557

no body could force thee to do it . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.558

Alack-a-day ! Thou seemest to be a Man of some consideration :
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.559

I mightily wonder thou should'st be so kind to People thou didst not
know , without any prospect of Recompence whatsoever .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,112.560

<P_4,113>

<font> Dunne <$$font> . All the Reason that induced me to it was , they
said they were Men in Debt , and desired to be concealed for a while .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.562

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou believe that any one here believes
thee ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.563

Pri@ @thee what Trade art thou ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.564

<font> Dunne <$$font> . My Lord , I am a Baker by Trade .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.565

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And wilt thou bake thy Bread at such easy
Rates ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.566

Upon my Word then , thou art very kind : LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.567

Pri@ @thee tell me , I believe thou dost use to bake on <font> Sundays
<$$font> , dost thou not ? LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.568

- <font> Dunne <$$font> . No , my Lord , I do not .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.569

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Alack-a-day ! Thou art precise in that ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.570

but thou can'st travel on <font> Sundays <$$font> to lead Rogues into
Lurking-holes : LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.571

It seemeth thou hast a particular Kindness for a black Beard ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.572

that@ @'s all thy Reason for undertaking all this Trouble .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.573

Thou hast told me all the Truth , hast thou ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.574

<font> Dunne <$$font> . I have , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.575

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But I assure thee , thy Bread is very light
Weight , LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.576

it will scarce pass the Balance here . LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.577

<font> Dunne <$$font> . I tell the Truth , and nothing but the Truth .
LISLE-1685-E3-P1,4,113.578
