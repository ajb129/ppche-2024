<font> Enter <$$font> Worthy . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.4

<font> Wor. <$$font> Save you , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.5

save you , good People ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.6

I@ @'m glad to find you all alive ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.7

I met a wounded Peer carrying off : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.8

For Heav'ns sake , what was the matter ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.9

<font> Lov. <$$font> O a Trifle : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.10

He wou'd have lain with my Wife before my Face , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.11

so she oblig'd him with a Box o'@ @the Ear , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.12

and I run him thro' the Body : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.13

That was all . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.14

<font> Wor. Bagatelle <$$font> on all sides . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.15

But , pray Madam , how long has this noble Lord been an humble Servant
of yours ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.16

<font> Aman. <$$font> This is the first I have heard on@ @'t .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.17

So I suppose 't@ @is his Quality more than his Love , has brought him
into this Adventure . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.18

He thinks his Title an authentick Passport to every Woman's Heart ,
below the Degree of a Peeress . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.19

<font> Wor. <$$font> He@ @'s Coxcomb enough to think any thing .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.20

But I wou'd not have you brought into Trouble for him :
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.21

I hope there@ @'s no Danger of his Life ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.22

<font> Lov. <$$font> None at all : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.23

He@ @'s fallen into the Hands of a Roguish Surgeon , I perceive designs
to frighten a little Money out of him . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.24

But I saw his Wound , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.25

't@ @is nothing ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.26

he may go to the Play to_Night , if he pleases . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.27

<font> Wor. <$$font> I@ @'m glad you have corrected him without farther
Mischief . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.28

And now , Sir , if these Ladies have no farther Service for you , you@
@'ll oblige me if you can go to the Place I spoke to you of t'@ @other
Day . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.29

<font> Lov. <$$font> With all my Heart . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.30

<paren> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$paren> VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.31

Tho' I cou'd wish , me@ @thinks , to stay and gaze a little longer on
that Creature . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.32

Good Gods ! VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.33

How beautiful she is . - VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.34

But what have I to do with Beauty ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.35

I have already had my Portion , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.36

and must not covet more . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.37

<paren> <font> To Wor. <$$font> <$$paren> Come , Sir , when you please
. VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.38

<font> Wor. <$$font> Ladies , your Servant . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.39

<font> Aman. <$$font> Mr. <font> Loveless , <$$font> pray one Word
with you before you go . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.40

<font> Lov. <$$font> to <font> Wor. <$$font> I@ @'ll overtake you ,
Sir ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.41

What wou'd my Dear ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.42

<font> Aman. <$$font> Only a Woman's foolish Question ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.43

How do you like my Couzen here ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.44

<font> Lov. <$$font> Jealous already , <font> Amanda <$$font> ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.45

<font> Aman. <$$font> Not at all ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.46

I ask you for another Reason . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.47

<font> Lov. Aside . <$$font> <$$paren> Whate'er her Reason be , I must
not tell her true . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.48

<paren> <font> To Aman. <$$font> <$$paren> Why , I confess she@ @'s
handsome . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.49

But you must not think I slight your Kinswoman , if I own to you , of
all the Women who may claim that Character , she is the last wou'd
triumph in my Heart . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,41.50

<P_42>

<font> Aman. <$$font> I@ @'m satisfy'd . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.52

<font> Lov. <$$font> Now tell me why you ask'd ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.53

<font> Aman. <$$font> At Night I will . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.54

Adieu . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.55

<font> Lov. <$$font> I@ @'m yours . <paren> <font> kissing her .
<$$font> <$$paren> VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.56

<paren> <font> Exit <$$font> Lov. VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.57

<font> Aman. <$$font> <paren> <font> aside . <$$font> <$$paren> I@ @'m
glad to find he does not like her ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.58

for I have a great mind to perswade her to come and live with me .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.59

<paren> <font> To Ber. <$$font> <$$paren> Now dear <font> Berinthia
<$$font> , let me enquire a little into your Affairs :
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.60

for I do assure you I am enough your Friend , to interest myself in
every thing that concerns you . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.61

<font> Ber. <$$font> You formerly have given me such Proofs on@ @'t , I
shou'd be very much to blame to doubt it ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.62

I am sorry I have no Secrets to trust you with , that I might convince
you how entire a Confidence I durst repose in you .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.63

<font> Aman. <$$font> Why is it possible , that one so Young and
Beautiful as you , shou'd live and have no Secrets ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.64

<font> Ber. <$$font> What Secrets do you mean ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.65

<font> Aman. <$$font> Lovers . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.66

<font> Ber. <$$font> O Twenty ; but not one secret one amongst 'em .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.67

Lovers in this Age have too much Honour to do any thing under-hand ;
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.68

they do all above-board . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.69

<font> Aman. <$$font> That now me@ @thinks wou'd make me hate a Man .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.70

<font> Ber. <$$font> But the Women of the Town are of another Mind :
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.71

For by this means a Lady may <paren> with the Expence of a few Coquet
Glances , <$$paren> lead twenty Fools about in a String , for two or
three Years together . Whereas , if she shou'd allow 'em greater
Favours , and oblige 'em to Secrecie , she wou'd not keep one of 'em a
Fortnight . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.72

<font> Aman. <$$font> There@ @'s something indeed in That to satisfie
the Vanity of a Woman , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.73

but I ca@ @n't comprehend how the Men find their Account in it .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.74

<font> Ber. <$$font> Their Entertainment , I must confess , is a Riddle
to me . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.75

For there@ @'s very few of them ever get farther than a Bow and an Ogle
. VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.76

I have half_a_Score for my share , who follow me all over the Town ; and
at the Play , the Park , and the Church , do <paren> with their Eyes
<$$paren> say the violent'st things to me - VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.77

But I never hear any more of 'em . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.78

<font> Aman. <$$font> What can be the Reason of that ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.79

<font> Ber. <$$font> One Reason is , They do@ @n't know how to go
farther . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.80

They have had so little Practice , they do@ @n't understand the Trade .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.81

But besides their Ignorance , you must know there is not one of my
half_score Lovers but what follows half_a_score Mistresses .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.82

Now their Affections being divided amongst so many , are not strong
enough for any one to make 'em pursue her to the purpose .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.83

Like a young Puppy in a Warren , they have a Flirt at all ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.84

and catch none . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.85

<font> Aman. <$$font> Yet they seem to have a Torrent of Love to
dispose of . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.86

<font> Ber. <$$font> They have so : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.87

But 't@ @is like the Rivers of a Modern Philosopher , <paren> whose
Works , tho' a Woman , I have read <$$paren> VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.88

it sets out with a violent Stream , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.89

splits in a_thousand Branches , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.90

and is all lost in the Sands . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,42.91

<P_43>

<font> Aman. <$$font> But do you think this River of Love runs all its
Course without doing any Mischief ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.93

Do you think it overflows nothing . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.94

<font> Ber. <$$font> O yes ; 't@ @is true , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.95

it never breaks into any Bodies Ground that has the least Fence about it
; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.96

but it overflows all the Commons that lie in its way .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.97

And this is the utmost Atchievement of those dreadful Champions in the
Field of Love - the Beaux . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.98

<font> Aman. <$$font> But pri@ @thee , <font> Berinthia , <$$font>
instruct me a little farther , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.99

for I am so great a Novice , I@ @'m almost asham'd on@ @'t .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.100

My Husband's leaving me whils't I was Young and Fond , threw me into
that Depth of Discontent , that ever since I have led so private and
recluse a Life , my Ignorance is scarce conceivable .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.101

I therefore fain would be instructed : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.102

Not <paren> Heaven knows <$$paren> that what you call Intrigues have any
Charms for me : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.103

my Love and Principles are too well fix'd . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.104

The Practick Part of all unlawful Love is - VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.105

<font> Ber. <$$font> O 't@ @is abominable : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.106

But for the Speculative ; that we must all confess is entertaining .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.107

The Conversation of all the Virtuous Women in the Town turns upon that
and new Cloaths . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.108

<font> Aman. <$$font> Pray be so just then to me , to believe , 't@ @is
with a World of Innocency I wou'd enquire , Whether you think those
Women we call Women of Reputation , do really 'scape all other Men , as
they do those Shadows of 'em , the Beaux . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.109

<font> Ber. <$$font> O no , <font> Amanda <$$font> ; there are a sort
of Men make dreadful Work amongst 'em : Men that may be call'd The Beaux
Antipathy ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.110

for they agree in nothing but walking upon two Legs .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.111

These have Brains : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.112

The Beau has none . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.113

These are in Love with their Mistress : The Beau with himself .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.114

They take care of her Reputation : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.115

He@ @'s industrious to destroy it . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.116

They are decent : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.117

He@ @'s a Fop . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.118

They are sound : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.119

He@ @'s rotten . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.120

They are Men : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.121

He@ @'s an Ass . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.122

<font> Aman. <$$font> If this be their Character , I fancy we had here
e'en now a Pattern of 'em both . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.123

<font> Ber. <$$font> His Lordship and Mr. <font> Worthy ? <$$font>
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.124

<font> Aman. <$$font> The same . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.125

<font> Ber. <$$font> As for the Lord , he@ @'s eminently so :
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.126

And for the other , I can assure you , there@ @'s not a Man in Town who
has a better Interest with the Women , that are worth having an Interest
with . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.127

But 't@ @is all private : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.128

He@ @'s like a Back-stair Minister at Court , who , whilst the reputed
Favourites are sauntering in the Bed-Chamber , is ruling the Roast in
the Closet . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.129

<font> Aman. <$$font> He answers then the Opinion I had ever of him .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.130

Heavens ! VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.131

What a difference there is between a Man like him , and that vain
nauseous Fop , Sir <font> Novelty ! <$$font> VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.132

<paren> <font> Taking her Hand . <$$font> <$$paren> I must acquaint you
. with a Secret , Couzen . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.133

'T@ @is not that Fool alone has talked to me of Love .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.134

<font> Worthy <$$font> has been tampering too : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.135

'T@ @is true , he has don@ @'t in vain : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,43.136

Not all his Charms <P_44> or Art have power to shake me .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.137

My Love , my Duty , and my Vertue , are such faithful Guards , I need
not fear my Heart shou'd e'er betray me . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.138

But what I wonder at is this : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.139

I find I did not start at his Proposal , as when it came from one whom I
contemn'd . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.140

I therefore mention this Attempt , that I may learn from you whence it
proceeds ; That Vice <paren> which can@ @not change its Nature <$$paren>
shou'd so far change at least its Shape , as that the self-same Crime
propos'd from one shall seem a Monster gaping at your Ruine , when from
another it shall look so kind , as tho' it were your Friend , and never
meant to harm you . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.141

Whence think you can this Difference proceed ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.142

For 't@ @is not Love , Heaven knows . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.143

<font> Ber. <$$font> O no ; I wou'd not for the World believe it were .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.144

But possibly , shou'd there a dreadful Sentence pass upon you , to
undergo the Rage of both their Passions ; the Pain you apprehend from
one might seem so trivial to the other ; the Danger wou'd not quite so
much allarm you . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.145

<font> Aman. <$$font> Fy , fy , <font> Berinthia , <$$font> you wou'd
indeed allarm me , cou'd you incline me to a Thought , that all the
Merit of Mankind combin'd , cou'd shake that tender Love I bear my
Husband : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.146

No , he sits triumphant in my Heart , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.147

and nothing can dethrone him . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.148

<font> Ber. <$$font> But shou'd he Abdicate again , do you think you
shou'd preserve the vacant Throne ten tedious Winters more in hopes of
his return ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.149

<font> Aman. <$$font> Indeed I think I shou'd . Tho' I confess , after
those Obligations he has to me , shou'd he abandon me once more , my
Heart wou'd grow extreamly urgent with me to root him thence , and cast
him out for ever . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.150

<font> Ber. <$$font> Were I that thing they call a slighted Wife , some
body shou'd run the risque of being that thing they call - a Husband .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.151

<font> Aman. <$$font> O fy , <font> Berinthia <$$font> , no Revenge
shou'd ever be taken against a Husband : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.152

But to wrong his Bed is a Vengeance , which of all Vengeance - <font>
Ber. <$$font> Is the sweetest - ha , ha , ha . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.153

Do@ @n't I talk madly ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.154

<font> Aman. <$$font> Madly indeed . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.155

<font> Ber. <$$font> Yet I@ @'m very innocent .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.156

<font> Aman. <$$font> That I dare swear you are .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.157

I know how to make Allowances for your Humour : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.158

You were always very entertaining Company ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.159

but I find since Marriage and Widowhood have shewn you the World a
little , you are very much improv'd . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.160

<font> Ber. <$$font> <paren> <font> aside . <$$font> <$$paren> Alack a
day , there has gone more than that to improve me , if she knew all .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.161

<font> Aman. <$$font> For Heaven's sake , <font> Berinthia <$$font> ,
tell me what way I shall take to perswade you to come and live with me ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.162

<font> Ber. <$$font> Why , one way in the World there is - and but one
. VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.163

<font> Aman. <$$font> Pray which is that ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.164

<font> Ber. <$$font> It is to assure me - I shall be very welcome .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,44.165

<P_45>

<font> Aman. <$$font> If that be all , you shall e'en lie here to_Night
. VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.167

<font> Ber. <$$font> To_Night ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.168

<font> Aman. <$$font> Yes , to_Night . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.169

<font> Ber. <$$font> Why , the People where I lodge will think me mad .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.170

<font> Aman. <$$font> Let 'em think what they please .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.171

<font> Ber. <$$font> Say you so , <font> Amanda <$$font> ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.172

Why then they shall think what they please : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.173

For I@ @'m a young Widow , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.174

and I care not what any body thinks . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.175

Ah , <font> Amanda <$$font> , it@ @'s a delicious thing to be a young
Widow . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.176

<font> Aman. <$$font> You@ @'ll hardly make me think so .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.177

<font> Ber. <$$font> Phu , because you are in Love with your Husband :
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.178

but that is not every Woman's Case . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.179

<font> Aman. <$$font> I hope 't@ @was yours , at least .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.180

<font> Ber. <$$font> Mine , say ye ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.181

Now I have a great mind to tell you a Lye , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.182

but I shou'd do it so awkwardly , you@ @'d find me out .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.183

<font> Aman. <$$font> Then e'en speak the Truth .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.184

<font> Ber. <$$font> Shall I ? - VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.185

Then after all , I did love him , <font> Amanda <$$font> - as a Nun does
Penance . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.186

<font> Aman. <$$font> Why did not you refuse to marry him then ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.187

<font> Ber. <$$font> Because my Mother wou'd have whipt me .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.188

<font> Aman. <$$font> How did you live together ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.189

<font> Ber. <$$font> Like Man and Wife , asunder ;
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.190

He lov'd the Country , I the Town . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.191

He Hawks and Hounds , I Coaches and Equipage . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.192

He Eating and Drinking , I Carding and Playing .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.193

He the Sound of a Horn , I the Squeak of a Fiddle .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.194

We were dull Company at Table , worse A-bed . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.195

Whenever we met , we gave one another the Spleen .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.196

And never agreed but once , which was about lying alone .

Death at last - extremely trouble you ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.200

<font> Ber. <$$font> O yes : VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.201

Not that my present Pangs were so very violent , but the After-pains

I was forc'd to wear a beastly Widow's Band a Twelvemonth for@ @'t .

When your Husband ran away from you , if you had fallen into some of my
Acquaintance , 't@ @would have sav'd you many a Tear .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.206

But you go VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.207

and live with a Grandmother , a Bishop , and an old Nurse ; which was
enough to make any Woman break her Heart for her Husband .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.208

Pray , <font> Amanda <$$font> , if ever you are a Widow again , keep
your self so as I do . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,45.209

tho' give me my Cloak , however ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,46.244

for in that Side-box , what between the Air that comes in at the Door on

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Brother , your Servant .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.253

How do you find yourself to-day ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.254

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> So well , that I have arder'd my Coach to the

So there@ @'s no great Danger of Death this baut , <font> Tam .
<$$font> VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.256

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> I@ @'m very glad of it .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.257

<font> Lord Fop. aside . <$$font> <$$paren> That I believe@ @'s a Lye

Pri@ @thee , <font> Tam , <$$font> tell me one thing :
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.259

Did not your Heart cut a Caper up to your Mauth , when you heard I was
run thro' the Bady ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.260

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Why do you think it shou'd ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.261

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Because I remember mine did so , when I heard
my Father was shat thro' the Head . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.262

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> It then did very ill .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.263

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Pri@ @thee , why so ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.264

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Because he us'd you very well .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.265

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Well - naw strike me dumb , he starv'd me .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.266

He has let me want a_Thausand Women for want of a_Thausand Paund .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.267

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Then he hind'red you from making a great many
ill Bargains ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.268

for I think no Woman is worth Money , that will take Money .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.269

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> If I were a younger Brother , I shou'd think
so too . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.270

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Why , is it possible you can value a Woman
that@ @'s to be bought . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.271

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Pri@ @thee , why not as well as a Pad-Nag ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.272

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Because a Woman has a Heart to dispose of ;
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.273

a Horse has none . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.274

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Look you , <font> Tam , <$$font> of all
things that belang to a Woman , I have an Aversion to her Heart ;
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.275

far when once a Woman has given you her Heart - you can never get rid of
the rest of her Body . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.276

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> This is strange Doctrine :
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.277

But pray in your Amours how is it with your own Heart ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.278

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Why , my Heart in my Amours is like my Heart
aut of my Amours : <font> a` la glace . <$$font>
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.279

My Bady , <font> Tam , <$$font> is a Watch ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.280

and my Heart is the Pendulum to it ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.281

whilst the Finger runs raund to every Hour in the Circle , that still
beats the same time . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.282

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Then you are seldom much in Love ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.283

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Never , Stap my Vitals .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.284

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Why then did you make all this Bustle about
<font> Amanda ? <$$font> VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.285

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Because she was a Woman of an Insolent Vertue
, VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.286

and I thought myself piqu'd in Honour to debauch her .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,47.287

<P_48>

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Very well . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.289

<paren> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$paren> Here@ @'s a rare Fellow for
you , to have the spending of Five_Thousand Pounds a Year .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.290

But now for my business with him . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.291

<paren> <font> To Lord Fop. <$$font> <$$paren> Brother , tho' I know to
talk of business <paren> especially of Money <$$paren> is a Theme not
quite so entertaining to you as that of the Ladies ; my Necessities are
such , I hope you@ @'ll have patience to hear me .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.292

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> The greatness of your Necessities , <font>
Tam <$$font> , is the worst Argument in the World for your being
patiently heard . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.293

I do believe you are going to make me a very good Speech ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.294

but , strike me dumb , it has the worst beginning of any Speech I have
heard this Twelve-month . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.295

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> I@ @'m very sorry you think so .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.296

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> I do believe thau art .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.297

But come , let@ @'s know thy Affair quickly ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.298

far 't@ @is a new Play , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.299

and I shall be so rumpled and squeez'd with pressing thro' the Crawd ,
to get to my Servant , the Women will think I have lain all Night in my
Cloaths . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.300

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Why then <paren> that I may not be the Author
of so great a Misfortune <$$paren> my Case in a Word is this .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.301

The necessary Expences of my Travels have so much exceeded the wretched
Income of my Annuity , that I have been forced to Mortgage it for
Five_Hundred Pounds , which is spent ; so that unless you are so kind to
assist me in redeeming it , I know no Remedy , but to go take a Purse .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.302

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Why , Faith , <font> Tam <$$font> - to give
you my Sense of the thing , I do think taking a Purse the best Remedy in
the World ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.303

for if you succeed , you are reliev'd that way ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.304

if you are taken - you are reliev'd t'@ @other .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.305

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> I@ @'m glad to see you are in so pleasant a
Humour , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.306

I hope I shall find the effects on@ @'t . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.307

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Why , do you then really think it a
reasonable thing I shou'd give you Five_Hundred Paunds ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.308

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> I do not ask it as a due , Brother ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.309

I am willing to receive it as a Favour . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.310

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Thau art willing to receive it any haw ,
strike me speechless . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.311

But these are damn'd times to give Money in , Taxes are so great ,
Repairs so exorbitant , Tenants such Rogues , and Periwigs so dear ,
that the Devil take me , I@ @'m reduc'd to that extremity in my Cash , I
have been forc'd to retrench in that one Article of sweet Pawder , till
I have braught it dawn to Five Guineas a Manth .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.312

Naw judge , <font> Tam <$$font> , whether I can spare you Five_Hundred
Paunds ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,48.313

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> If you ca@ @n't , I must starve ,

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Do@ @n't be in a Passion , <font> Tam

Look you , I do@ @n't love to say any thing to you to make you

Whence springs this mighty Friendship all at once ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,51.382

For our Acquaintance is of a later Date . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,51.383

Husband ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.588

<font> Ber. <$$font> O ho , is it come to that ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.589

We shall have you wish your self a Widow by and by .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.590

<font> Aman. <$$font> Wou'd I were any thing but what I am ;
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.591

A base ungrateful Man , after what I have done for him , to use me thus

<font> Ber. <$$font> What , he has been Ogling now , I@ @'ll warrant
you ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.593

<font> Aman. <$$font> Yes , he has been Ogling .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.594

<font> Ber. <$$font> And so you are jealous ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.595

Is that all ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.596

<font> Aman. <$$font> That all ! VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.597

Is jealousie then nothing ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.598

<font> Ber. <$$font> It shou'd be nothing , if I were in your Case .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.599

VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.600

<font> Ber. <$$font> I@ @'d cure myself . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.601

<font> Aman. <$$font> How ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.602

<font> Ber. <$$font> Let Blood in the Fond Vein :
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.603

Care as little for my Husband , as he did for me .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.604

<font> Aman. <$$font> That would not stap his course .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.605

<font> Ber. <$$font> Nor nothing else , when the Wind@ @'s in the warm
Corner . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.606

Look you , <font> Amanda , <$$font> you may build Castles in the Air ,
and Fume , and Fret , and grow Thin and Lean , and Pale and Ugly , if
you please . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.607

But I tell you , no Man worth having , is true to his Wife ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.608

or can be true to his Wife , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.609

or ever was , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.610

or ever will be so . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.611

<font> Aman. <$$font> Do you then really think he@ @'s false to me ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.612

for I did but suspect him . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.613

<font> Ber. <$$font> Think so ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.614

I know he@ @'s so . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.615

<font> Aman. <$$font> Is it possible ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.616

Pray tell me what you know . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.617

<font> Ber. <$$font> Do@ @n't press me then to name Names ;
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.618

<font> Aman. <$$font> Well , I wo@ @n't ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.620

but let me know all you can without Perjury . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.621

<font> Ber. <$$font> I@ @'ll let you know enough to prevent any wise
Woman's dying of the Pip ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.622

and I hope you@ @'ll pluck up your Spirits , and shew upon occasion ,
you can be as good a Wife as the best of 'em . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.623

<font> Aman. <$$font> Well , what a Woman can do I@ @'ll endeavour .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.624

<font> Ber. <$$font> O , a Woman can do a great deal , if once she sets
her mind to it . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.625

Therefore pray do@ @n't stand trifling any longer , and teasing yourself
with this and that , and your Love and your Vertue , and I know not what
. VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.626

But resolve to hold up your Head , get a Tiptoe , and look over 'em all
; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.627

for to my certain knowledge your Husband is a Pickering elsewhere .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.628

<font> Aman. <$$font> You are sure on@ @'t ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.629

<font> Ber. <$$font> Positively , he fell in Love at the Play .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.630

<font> Aman. <$$font> Right , the very same ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.631

do you know the ugly thing ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,56.632

<font> Ber. <$$font> Yes , I know her well enough ;

VANBR-1696-E3-P1,65.656

<$$heading>

<font> Enter <$$font> Amanda <font> and <$$font> Berinthia .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,65.658

{COM:verse_omitted} <font> Aman. <$$font> Well , now <font> Berinthia
<$$font> , I@ @'m at leisure to hear what 't@ @was you had to say to me
. VANBR-1696-E3-P1,65.659

What I had to say , was only to Eccho the Sighs and Groans of a dying
lover . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,65.660

<font> Aman. <$$font> Phu , will you never learn to talk in earnest of
any thing ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,65.661

<font> Ber. <$$font> Why this shall be in earnest , if you please ;
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,65.662

for my part , I only tell you matter of fact , you make it which way you
like best ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,65.663

but if you@ @'ll follow the Women of the Town , you@ @'ll take it both
ways ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,65.664

for when <P_66> a Man offers himself to one of them , first she takes
him in jest , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.665

and then she takes him in earnest . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.666

<font> Aman. <$$font> I@ @'m sure there@ @'s so much jest and earnest
in what you say to me , I scarce know how to take it ;
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.667

but I think you have bewitched me , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.668

for I do@ @n't find it possible to be angry with you , say what you will
. VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.669

<font> Ber. <$$font> I@ @'m very glad to hear it ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.670

for I have no mind to quarrel with you , for more Reasons than I@ @'ll
brag of ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.671

but quarrel or not , smile or frown , I must tell you what I have
suffer'd upon your account . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.672

<font> Aman. <$$font> Upon my account ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.673

<font> Ber. <$$font> Yes , upon yours ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.674

I have been forc'd to sit still and hear you commended for two hours
together , without one Complement to my self ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.675

now do@ @n't you think a Woman has a blessed time of that ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.676

<font> Aman. <$$font> Alas ! VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.677

I shoud'd have been unconcern'd at it ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.678

I never knew where the Pleasure lay of being prais'd by the Men :
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.679

but pray who was this that commended me so ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.680

<font> Ber. <$$font> One you have a moral aversion to , Mr. <font>
Worthy : <$$font> VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.681

he us'd you like a Text , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.682

he took you all to pieces , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.683

but spoke so learnedly upon every Point , one might see the Spirit of
the Church was in him ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.684

if you are a Woman , you@ @'d have been in an Extasie to have heard how
feelingly he handled your Hair , your Eyes , your Nose , your Mouth ,
your Teeth , your Tongue , your Chin , your Neck , and so forth .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.685

Thus he Preach'd for an hour , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.686

but when he came to use an Application , he observ'd that all these
without a Gallant were nothing - VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.687

Now consider of what has been said , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.688

and Heaven give you Grace to put it in practice .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.689

<font> Aman. <$$font> Alas ! VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.690

<font> Berinthia <$$font> , did I incline to a gallant , <paren> which
you know I do not <$$paren> do you think a Man so nice as he , cou'd
have the least concern for such a plain unpolisht thing as I am ?
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.691

It is impossible ! VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.692

<font> Ber. <$$font> Now have you a great mind to put me upon
commending you . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.693

<font> Aman. <$$font> Indeed that was not my design .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.694

<font> Ber. <$$font> Nay , if it were , it@ @'s all one ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.695

for I wo@ @n't do@ @'t , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.696

I@ @'ll leave that to your Looking-glass . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.697

But to shew you I have some good Nature left , I@ @'ll commend him ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.698

and may_be that may do as well . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.699

<font> Aman. <$$font> You have a great mind to perswade me I am in Love
with him . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.700

<font> Ber. <$$font> I have a great mind to perswade you , you do@ @n't
know what you are in love with . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.701

<font> Aman. <$$font> I am sure I am not in love with him , nor never
shall be , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.702

so let that pass ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.703

but you were saying something you wou'd commend him for .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.704

<font> Ber. <$$font> Oh you@ @'d be glad to hear a good Character of
him however . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.705

<font> Aman. <$$font> Psha . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.706

<font> Ber. <$$font> Psha - Well , 't@ @is a foolish undertaking for
Women in these kind of Matters , to pretend to deceive one another -
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.707

Have I not been bred a Woman as well as you ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.708

<font> Aman. <$$font> What then ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,66.709

<P_67>

<font> Ber. <$$font> Why then I understand my Trade so well , that when
ever I am told of a Man I like , I cry , Psha ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.711

but that I may spare you the pains of putting me a second time in mind
to commend him , I@ @'ll proceed , and give you this account of him :
That tho' 't@ @is possible he may have had Women with as good Faces as
your Ladyship's <paren> no Discredit to it neither <$$paren> yet you
must know your cautious Behaviour , with that reserve in your Humour ,
has given him his Death's wound ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.712

he mortally hates a Coquett ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.713

he says 't@ @is impossible to love where we can@ @not esteem ; and that
no Woman can be esteem'd by a Man who has sense , if she makes her self
cheap in the Eye of a Fool . That Pride to a Woman , is as necessary as
Humility to a Divine ; and that far-fetch'd , and dear bought , is Meat
for Gentlemen , as well as for Ladies - In short , that every Woman who
has Beauty , may set a price upon her self , and that by under-selling
the Market , they ruin the Trade . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.714

This is his Doctrine , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.715

how do you like it ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.716

<font> Aman. <$$font> So well that , since I never intend to have a
Gallant for my self , if I were to recommend one to a Friend , he shou'd
be the Man . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.717

<font> Enter <$$font> Worthy . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.718

Bless me ! he@ @'s here ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.719

pray Heaven he did@ @n't hear me . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.720

<font> Ber. <$$font> If he did , it wo@ @n't hurt your Reputation ;
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.721

your Thoughts are as safe in his Heart , as in your own .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.722

<font> Wor. <$$font> I venture in at an unseasonable time of Night ,
Ladies ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.723

I hope if I am troublesome , you@ @'ll use the same freedom in turning
me out again . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.724

<font> Aman. <$$font> I believe it ca@ @n't be late ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.725

for Mr. <font> Loveless <$$font> is not come home yet ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.726

and he usually keeps good hours . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.727

<font> Wor. <$$font> Madam , I@ @'m afraid he@ @'ll transgress a little
to_Night ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.728

for he told me about half an hour ago , he was going to sup with some
Company , he doubted would keep him out 'till three or four a Clock in
the Morning , VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.729

and desir'd I would let my Servant acquaint you with it , that you might
not expect him ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.730

but my Fellow@ @'s a Blunder-head ; VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.731

so lest he should make some mistake , I thought it my Duty to deliver
the message my self . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.732

<font> Aman. <$$font> I@ @'m very sorry he shou'd give you that trouble
, Sir . VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.733

But - VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.734

<font> Ber. <$$font> But since he has , will you give me leave , Madam
, to keep him to play at Ombre with us ? VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.735

<font> Aman. <$$font> Cousin , you know you command my House .
VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.736

VANBR-1696-E3-P1,67.738
