but now give me leave to let you know : that I am thus far sensible :
that as an Aditione to all your former favours ; you have Intrusted me
with your Daughter : mis Katherine whose welfare I perceive you very
much Desire : of the which truly I am not a little glad :
JACKSON-1655-E3-P1,204.6

for so far I am Able to Aprehend ; noe Child you have is more likely to
deserve your love : shee beeing as Ingenious <paren> for her years
<$$paren> as can possibly bee expected : which truly is noe small
Incouradgment to any teacher : JACKSON-1655-E3-P1,204.7

but <paren> besides the Obligation of my own Conscience <$$paren>
nothing can so Animate mee in Indeavouring to doe her good : as the very
nameing of my Honoured friend Mis Dixwell , who I perceive was an
Ad_mother to my Little Scholler ; JACKSON-1655-E3-P1,204.8

but yet give mee Leave to tell you ; that I hope shee will prove a
better Christian then either Shee or any mortall is able to make her ;
JACKSON-1655-E3-P1,204.9

but as concerning what lies uppon us : my hopes are that my Indeavours
and hers concuring , her Improvement will <paren> At Least in sume
degree <$$paren> Answer both yours and her mother's Expectations :
JACKSON-1655-E3-P1,204.10

but you know , Sir , that Roome was not built in a day :
JACKSON-1655-E3-P1,204.11

JACKSON-1655-E3-P1,204.12

otherwise shee would have appeared in her owne Charecter before this :
JACKSON-1655-E3-P1,204.13

but in Convenient time : I hope her owne Lines will speake her : your
Dutifull Daughter ; JACKSON-1655-E3-P1,204.14

in the meanetime : she humbly presents her promise of obedience : to
yourselfe and her mother : with her Love to her Sister Oxinden : Sister
Bettey : and Sister Mary : which being donne I shall Ad noe more : but
the presentatione of her service to yourselfe and mis Oxinden : who is
Your obliged Servant Margret Jackson . JACKSON-1655-E3-P1,204.15
