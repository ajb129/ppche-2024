ACT II . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.84

SCENE , A GALLERY IN LADY BOUNTYFUL'S HOUSE . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.85

<$$heading>

<font> Mrs. <$$font> Sullen <font> and <$$font> Dorinda <font> meeting
. <$$font> FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.87

<font> Dor. <$$font> Morrow , my dear Sister ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.88

are you for Church this Morning ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.89

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Any where to Pray ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.90

for Heaven alone can help me : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.91

But , I think , <font> Dorinda <$$font> , there@ @'s no Form of Prayer
in the Liturgy against bad Husbands . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.92

<font> Dor. <$$font> But there@ @'s a Form of Law in <font>
Doctors-Commons <$$font> ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.93

and I swear , Sister Sullen , rather than see you thus continually
discontented , I would advise you to apply to that :
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.94

For besides the part that I bear in your vexatious Broils , as being
Sister to the Husband , and Friend to the Wife ; your Example gives me
such an Impression of Matrimony , that I shall be apt to condemn my
Person to a long Vacation all its Life . - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.95

But supposing , Madam , that you brought it to a Case of Separation ,
what can you urge against your Husband ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.96

My Brother is , first , the most constant Man alive .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.97

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> The most constant Husband , I grant ye
{SIC:grant'ye} . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.98

<font> Dor. <$$font> He never sleeps from you .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.99

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> No , he always sleeps with me .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.100

<font> Dor. <$$font> He allows you a Maintenance suitable to your
Quality . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.101

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> A Maintenance ! FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.102

do you take me , Madam , for an hospital Child , that I must sit down ,
and bless my Benefactors for Meat , Drink and Clothes ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.103

As I take it , Madam , I brought your brother Ten_thousand Pounds , out
of which , I might expect some pretty things , call'd Pleasures .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.104

<font> Dor. <$$font> You share in all the Pleasures that the Country
affords . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.105

Mrs. <font> Sul. <$$font> Country Pleasures !
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.106

Racks and Torments ! FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.107

dost think , Child , that my Limbs were made for leaping of Ditches ,
and clambring over Stiles ; or that my Parents wisely foreseeing my
future Happiness in Country-pleasures , had early instructed me in the
rural Accomplishments of drinking fat Ale , playing at Whisk , and
smoaking Tobacco with my Husband ; or of spreading of Plaisters ,
brewing of Diet-drinks , and stilling Rosemary-Water with the good old
Gentlewoman , my Mother-in-Law . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,11.108

<P_12>

<font> Dor. <$$font> I@ @'m sorry , Madam , that it is not more in our
power to divert you ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.110

I cou'd wish indeed that our Entertainments were a little more polite ,
or your Taste a little less refin'd : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.111

But , pray , Madam , how came the Poets and Philosophers that labour'd
so much in hunting after Pleasure , to place it at last in a Country
Life ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.112

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Because they wanted Money , Child , to find
out the Pleasures of the Town : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.113

Did you ever see a Poet or Philosopher worth Ten_thousand Pound ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.114

if you can shew me such a Man , I@ @'ll lay you Fifty Pound you@ @'ll
find him somewhere within the Weekly Bills . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.115

Not that I disapprove rural Pleasures , as the Poets have painted them ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.116

in their Landschape every <font> Phillis <$$font> has her <font> Coridon
<$$font> , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.117

every murmuring Stream , and every flowry Mead gives froth {COM:sic}
Alarms to Love . - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.118

Besides , you@ @'ll find , that their Couples were never marry'd : -
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.119

But yonder I see my <font> Coridon <$$font> , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.120

and a sweet Swain it is , Heaven knows . - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.121

Come , <font> Dorinda <$$font> , do@ @n't be angry ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.122

he@ @'s my Husband , and your Brother ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.123

and between both is he not a sad Brute ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.124

<font> Dor. <$$font> I have nothing to say to your part of him ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.125

you@ @'re the best Judge . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.126

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> O Sister , Sister !
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.127

if ever you marry , beware of a sullen , silent Sot , one that@ @'s
always musing , but never thinks : - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.128

There@ @'s some Diversion in a talking Blockhead ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.129

and since a Woman must wear Chains , I wou'd have the Pleasure of
hearing 'em rattle a little . - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.130

Now you shall see , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.131

but take this by the way ; - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.132

He came home this Morning at his usual Hour of Four ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.133

waken'd me out of a sweet Dream of something else , by tumbling over the
Tea-table , which he broke all to pieces , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.134

after his Man and he had rowl'd about the Room like sick Passengers in a
Storm , he comes flounce into Bed , dead as a Salmon into a Fishmonger's
Basket ; his Feet cold as Ice , his Breath hot as a Furnace , and his
Hands and his Face as greasy as his Flanel Night-cap . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.135

Oh Matrimony ! - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.136

He tosses up the Clothes with a barbarous swing over his Shoulders ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.137

disorders the whole Oeconomy of my Bed , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.138

leaves me half naked , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.139

and my whole Night's Comfort is the tuneable Serenade of that wakeful
Nightingale , his Nose . - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.140

O the Pleasure of counting the melancholly Clock by a snoring Husband !
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.141

But now , Sister , you shall see how handsomely , being a well-bred Man
, he will beg my Pardon . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,12.142

FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,13.181

did you ever know so hard , so obstinate a Spleen as his ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,13.182

O Sister , Sister ! FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,13.183

I shall never ha' Good of the Beast till I get him to Town ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,13.184

<font> London <$$font> , dear <font> London <$$font> is the Place for
managing and breaking a Husband . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,13.185

<font> Dor. <$$font> And has not a Husband the same Opportunities there
for humbling a Wife ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,13.186

<P_14>

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> No , no , Child ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.188

't@ @is a standing Maxim in conjugal Discipline , that when a Man wou'd
enslave his Wife , he hurries her into the Country ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.189

and when a Lady would be arbitrary with her Husband , she wheedles her
Booby up to Town . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.190

A Man dare not play the Tyrant in London , because there are so many
Examples to encourage the Subject to rebel . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.191

O <font> Dorinda <$$font> , <font> Dorinda <$$font> !
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.192

a fine Woman may do any thing in London : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.193

O'@ @my Conscience , she may raise an Army of Forty_thousand Men .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.194

<font> Dor. <$$font> I fancy , Sister , you have a mind to be trying
your Power that way here in <font> Litchfield <$$font> ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.195

you have drawn the <font> French <$$font> Count to your Colours already

FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.197

<font> Dor. <$$font> And some <font> English <$$font> that I know ,

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Well , Sister , since the Truth must out ,
it may do as well now as hereafter ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.199

I think one way to rouse my Lethargick sotish Husband , is , to give him
a Rival ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.200

Security begets Negligence in all People , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.201

and Men must be alarm'd to make 'em alert in their Duty :
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.202

Women are like Pictures of no Value in the Hands of a Fool , till he
hears Men of Sense bid high for the Purchase .

<font> Dor. <$$font> This might do , Sister , if my Brother's
Understanding were to be convinc'd into a Passion for you ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.204

but I fancy there@ @'s a natural Aversion of his side ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.205

and I fancy , Sister , that you do@ @n't come much behind him , if you
dealt fairly . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.206

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> I own it , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.207

we are united Contradictions , Fire and Water :
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.208

But I cou'd be contented , with a great many other Wives , to humour the
censorious Mob , and give the World an Appearance of living well with my
Husband , cou'd I bring him but to dissemble a little Kindness to keep
me in Countenance . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.209

<font> Dor. <$$font> But how do you know , Sister , but that instead of
rousing your Husband by this Artifice to a counterfeit Kindness , he
should awake in a real Fury . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.210

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Let him : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.211

If I ca@ @n't entice him to the one , I wou'd provoke him to the other .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.212

<font> Dor. <$$font> But how must I behave my self between ye .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.213

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> You must assist me .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.214

<font> Dor. <$$font> What , against my own Brother !
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.215

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> He@ @'s but half a Brother ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.216

and I@ @'m your entire Friend : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,14.217

<P_15>

If I go a step beyond the Bounds of Honour , leave me ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.219

till then I expect you should go along with me in every thing ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.220

while I trust my Honour in your Hands , you may trust your brother's in
mine . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.221

The Count is to dine here to_Day . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.222

<font> Dor. <$$font> 'T@ @is a strange thing , Sister , that I ca@ @n't
like that Man . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.223

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> You like nothing ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.224

your time is not come ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.225

Love and Death have their Fatalities , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.226

and strike home one time or other : - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.227

You@ @'ll pay for all one Day , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.228

I warrant ye {SIC:warrant'ye} . - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.229

But , come , my Lady's Tea is ready , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.230

and 't@ @is almost Church-time . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.231

<font> Exeunt . <$$font> FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.232

<heading>

SCENE , THE INN . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.234

<$$heading>

<font> Enter <$$font> Aimwell <font> dress'd , and <$$font> Archer .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.236

<font> Aim. <$$font> And was she the Daughter of the House ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.237

<font> Arch. <$$font> The Landlord is so blind as to think so ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.238

but I dare swear she has better Blood in her Veins .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.239

<font> Aim. <$$font> Why dost think so ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.240

<font> Arch. <$$font> Because the Baggage has a pert <font> Je ne scai
quoi <$$font> , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.241

she reads Plays , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.242

keeps a Monkey , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.243

and is troubled with Vapours . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.244

<font> Aim. <$$font> By which Discoveries I guess that you know more of
her . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.245

<font> Arch. <$$font> Not yet , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.246

Faith , the Lady gives her self Airs , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.247

forsooth , nothing under a Gentleman . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.248

<font> Aim. <$$font> Let me take her in hand .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.249

<font> Arch. <$$font> Say one Word more o'@ @that , and I@ @'ll declare
my self , spoil your Sport there , and every where else ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.250

look ye {SIC:look'ye} , <font> Aimwell <$$font> , every Man in his own
Sphere . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.251

<font> Aim. <$$font> Right ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.252

and therefore you must pimp for your Master .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.253

<font> Arch. <$$font> In the usual Forms , good Sir , after I have
serv'd my self . - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.254

But to our Business : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.255

You are so well dress'd , <font> Tom <$$font> , and make so handsome a
Figure , that I fancy you may do Execution in a Country Church ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.256

the exteriour part strikes first , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.257

and you@ @'re in the right to make that Impression favourable .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.258

<font> Aim. <$$font> There@ @'s something in that which may turn to
Advantage : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.259

The Appearance of a Stranger in a Country Church draws as many Gazers as
a blazing Star ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.260

no sooner he comes into the Cathedral , but a Train of Whispers runs
buzzing round the Congregation in a moment ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.261

Who is he ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.262

whence comes he ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.263

do you know him ? - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.264

Then I , Sir , tips me the Verger with half a Crown ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.265

he pockets the Simony , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,15.266

and Inducts me into the <P_16> best Pue in the Church ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.267

I pull out my Snuff-box , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.268

turn my self round , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.269

bow to the Bishop , or the Dean , if he be the commanding Officer ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.270

single out a Beauty , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.271

rivet both my Eyes to hers , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.272

set my Nose a bleeding by the Strength of Imagination ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.273

and shew the whole Church my concern by my endeavouring to hide it ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.274

after the Sermon , the whole Town gives me to her for a Lover ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.275

and by perswading the Lady that I am a dying for her , the Tables are
turn'd , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.276

and she in good earnest falls in Love with me ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.277

<font> Arch. <$$font> There@ @'s nothing in this , <font> Tom ,
<$$font> without a Precedent ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.278

but instead of riveting your Eyes to a Beauty , try to fix 'em upon a
Fortune , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.279

that@ @'s our Business at present . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.280

<font> Aim. <$$font> Pshaw , no Woman can be a Beauty without a Fortune
. - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.281

Let me alone , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.282

for I am a Mark'sman . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.283

<font> Arch. Tom . <$$font> FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.284

<font> Aim. <$$font> Ay . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.285

<font> Arch. <$$font> When were you at Church before , pray ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.286

<font> Aim. <$$font> Um - I was there at the Coronation .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.287

<font> Arch. <$$font> And how can you expect a Blessing by going to
Church now ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.288

<font> Aim. <$$font> Blessing ! FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.289

nay , <font> Frank <$$font> , I ask but for a Wife .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.290

<font> Exit . <$$font> FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.291

<font> Arch. <$$font> Truly the Man is not very unreasonable in his
Demands . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.292

<font> Exit at the opposite Door . <$$font> FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.293

<font> Enter <$$font> Bonniface <font> and <$$font> Cherry .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.294

<font> Bon. <$$font> Well Daughter , as the saying is , have you
brought Martin to confess ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.295

<font> Cher. <$$font> Pray , Father , do@ @n't put me upon getting any
thing out of a Man ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.296

I@ @'m but young you know , Father , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.297

and I do@ @n't understand Wheedling . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.298

<font> Bon. <$$font> Young ! FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.299

why you jade , as the saying is , can any Woman wheedle that is not
young , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.300

you'r Mother was useless at five_and_twenty ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.301

not wheedle ! FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.302

would you make your Mother a Whore and me a Cuckold ; as the saying is ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.303

I tell you his Silence confesses it , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.304

and his Master spends his Money so freely , and is so much a Gentleman
every manner of way that he must be a Highwayman .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.305

<font> Enter <$$font> Gibbet <font> in a Cloak . <$$font>
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.306

FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,16.307

<font> Bon. <$$font> O , Mr. <font> Gibbet <$$font> , What@ @'s the

the Hilts : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.319

Here is a Diamond Necklace which the Lady hid in the privatest place in
the Coach , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.320

but I found it out : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.321

This Gold Watch I took from a Pawn-broker's Wife ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.322

it was left in her Hands by a Person of Quality ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.323

<font> Cher. <$$font> But who had you the Money from ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.325

<font> Gib. <$$font> Ah ! poor Woman ! FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.326

I pitied her ; - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.327

From a poor Lady just elop'd from her Husband ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.328

she had made up her Cargo , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.329

and was bound for Ireland , as hard as she cou'd drive ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.330

she told me of her Husband's barbarous Usage ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.331

and so I left her half a Crown : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.332

But I had almost forgot , my dear <font> Cherry <$$font> ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,17.333

<font> Cher. <$$font> Love is I know not what ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.415

it comes I know not how FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.416

and goes I know not when . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.417

<font> Arch. <$$font> Very well , an apt Scholar .

<font> Cher. <$$font> I wo@ @n't tell ye {SIC:tell'ye} .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.423

<font> Arch. <$$font> What are Objects of that Passion ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.424

<font> Cher. <$$font> Youth , Beauty , and clean Linen .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.425

<font> Arch. <$$font> The Reason ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.426

<font> Cher. <$$font> The two first are fashionable in Nature , and the

<font> Arch. <$$font> That@ @'s my Dear : FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.428

What are the Signs and Tokens of that Passion ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.429

<font> Cher. <$$font> A stealing Look , a stammering Tongue , Words
improbable , Designs impossible , and Actions impracticable .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.430

<font> Arch. <$$font> That@ @'s my good Child ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.431

kiss me . - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.432

What must a Lover do to obtain his Mistress .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.433

<font> Cher. <$$font> He must adore the Person that disdains him ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.434

he must bribe the Chambermaid that betrays him , and court the Footman
that laughs at him ; - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.435

He must , FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.436

he must - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.437

<font> Arch. <$$font> Nay ; Child , I must whip you if you do@ @n't
mind your Lesson ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.438

he must treat his - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.439

<font> Cher. <$$font> O , ay , he must treat his Enemies with Respect ,
his Friends with Indifference , and all the World with Contempt ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.440

he must suffer much , and fear more ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.441

he must desire much , and hope little ; FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.442

in short , he must embrace his Ruine , and throw himself away .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.443

<font> Arch. <$$font> Had ever Man so hopeful a Pupil as mine ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.444

come , my Dear , why is Love call'd a Riddle ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.445

<font> Cher. <$$font> Because being blind , he leads those that see ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.446

and tho' a Child , he governs a Man . FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.447

<font> Arch. <$$font> Mighty well - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.448

And why is Love pictur'd blind ? FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.449

<font> Cher. <$$font> Because the Painters , out of the weakness or
privilege of their Art chose to hide those Eyes that they cou'd not draw
. FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.450

<font> Arch. <$$font> That@ @'s , my dear little Scholar ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.451

kiss me again . - FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.452

And why shou'd Love , that@ @'s a Child , govern a Man ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,19.453

<P_20>

<font> Cher. <$$font> Because that a Child is the end of Love .
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,20.455

<font> Arch. <$$font> And so ends Love's Catechism . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E1-P1,20.456
