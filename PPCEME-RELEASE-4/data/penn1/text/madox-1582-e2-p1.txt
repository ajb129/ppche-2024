in casting how to fynde owt a perfect longitude in sayling , I
considered that al ephemerides which are calculated according to the
latitude of any place have certenty of truth noe wher but in the same
longitude wher the observation was taken , which is a note ether not
heeded or not as I kno by any yet publyshed . MADOX-1582-E2-P1,92.64

The evident proof hearof is this . MADOX-1582-E2-P1,92.65

suppoze your ephemerides be calculate for the miridian of Compostella in
Galizia which is abowt 44 degrees in latitude , and 14 in longitude .
MADOX-1582-E2-P1,92.66

In erecting a figure ryght at noone I fynd the moon
{COM:preceding_word_"moon"_emended} to be just in the angle of the east
, 5 degrees beyond the buls eye . MADOX-1582-E2-P1,92.67

Now yf I wold by the same book erect a figure for the same noontyde at
Constantinople , which is of the same elevation , I shall fynd the
{COM:preceding_word_"the"_emended} moon
{COM:preceding_word_"moon"_emended} somwhat within the angle of the east
and but 3 degrees and 30 mynuts overpast the buls eye ,
MADOX-1582-E2-P1,92.68

and this <font> in medio motu <$$font> {TEXT:symbol_of_the_moon} because
Constantinople being at 59 degrees in longitude , yt fawleth to be 3 a
clock at Constantinople , when yt is noone at Compostella , so that yn
those 3 howrs the {COM:preceding_word_"the"_emended} moon
{COM:preceding_word_"moon"_emended} according to hir mydle motion <P_93>
passeth a degree and a half , and so at noone in Compostella is 5
degrees past the buls eye . MADOX-1582-E2-P1,93.69

Hens may be gathered this instruction : MADOX-1582-E2-P1,93.70

1 . suppoze yt be fownd by observation that 2 Sept. 1582 the ful moon
rising in the east angle be 3 sygnes and 20 degrees behind the hart of
the scorpion , at the general meridian , which is the beginning of
longitude , and the latitude of 40 or 50 or so furth yt much matereth
not . MADOX-1582-E2-P1,93.71

Now yf the same second day of September I trend an unknoen place , and
ther fynd that the moon {COM:preceding_word_"moon"_emended} rising in
the east angle be 3 sygnes and but 17 degrees behind the hart of the
scorpion , and in hir midmotion , I pronownce that I am risen eastward
90 degrees in longitude from the general meridian , which is my first
observation , wherunto applying my latitude , I fynd the exact poynt of
the yerth wher I am , MADOX-1582-E2-P1,93.72

but yf the moone rising be 3 sygnes and 23 degrees behind the hart of
the scorpion than am I fauln to the west of my general meridian
MADOX-1582-E2-P1,93.73

and so am at 270 degrees of longitude , MADOX-1582-E2-P1,93.74

and by this proportion judge of al other . MADOX-1582-E2-P1,93.75

And this is an observation as I think never publyshed . |
