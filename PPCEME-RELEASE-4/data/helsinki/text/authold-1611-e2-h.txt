for in the day that thou eatest thereof , thou shalt surely die .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,2,1G.157

18 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,2,1G.158

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,14,1N.931

were it not better for vs to returne into Egypt ?

and how long will it bee , yer they beleeue me , for all the signes
which I haue shewed among them ? AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,14,1N.956

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,14,1N.959

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,14,1N.965

15 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,14,1N.966

Now if thou shalt kill all this people , as one man , then the nations

the LORD was not able to bring this people into the lande which he sware

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,14,1N.967

Because all those men which haue seene my glory , and my miracles which

not see the land which I sware vnto their fathers ,

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,14,20N.999

33 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,14,20N.1000

And your children shall wander in the wildernes forty yeres , and beare

for we haue sinned . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,14,40N.1021

and the Elders of Israel followed him . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1114

26 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1115

And hee spake vnto the Congregation , saying , Depart , I pray you ,
from the tents of these wicked men , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1116

and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consumed in all their sinnes .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1117

27 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1118

So they gate vp from the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on
euery side : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1119

, and their little children . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1121

28 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1122

And Moses said , Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to doe
all these workes : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1123

for <font> I haue <$$font> not <font> done them <$$font> of mine owne
mind . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1124

29 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1125

If these men die the common death of all men , or if they be visited
after the visitation of all men , then the LORD hath not sent me :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1126

30 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1127

But if the LORD make a new thing , and the earth open her mouth , and
swallow them vp , with all that appertaine vnto them , and they go downe
quicke into the pit : then ye shall vnderstand that these men haue
prouoked the LORD . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1128

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1130

32 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1131

And the earth opened her mouth , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1132

and swallowed them vp , and their houses , and all the men that
appertained vnto Korah , and all their goods .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1133

33 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1134

They , and all that appertained to them , went downe aliue into the pit
, AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1135

and the earth closed vpon them : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1136

and they perished from among the Congregation .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1137

34 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1138

And all Israel that were round about them , fled at the crie of them :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1139

for they said , Lest the earth swallow vs vp <font> also <$$font> .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1140

35 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1141

And there came out a fire from the LORD , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1142

and consumed the two_hundred_and_fiftie men that offered incense .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1143

36 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1144

And the LORD spake vnto Moses , saying , 37 Speake vnto Eleazar the
sonne of Aaron the Priest , that he take vp the censers out of the
burning , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1145

and scatter thou the fire yonder , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1146

for they are hallowed . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1147

38 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1148

The censers of these sinners against their owne soules , let them make
them broad plates for a couering of the Altar :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1149

for they offered them before the LORD , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1150

therefore they are hallowed , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1151

and they shall be a signe vnto the children of Israel .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1152

39 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,20N.1153

And Eleazar the Priest tooke the brasen censers , wherewith they that

and they were made broad <font> plates <$$font> for a couering of the

Moses . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1155

41 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1156

But on the morrow , all the Congregation of the children of Israel
murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , Ye haue killed the
people of the LORD . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1157

42 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1158

And it came to passe when the Congregation was gathered against Moses
and against Aaron , that they looked toward the Tabernacle of the
Congregation : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1159

and behold , the cloud couered it , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1160

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1163

44 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1164

And the LORD spake vnto Moses , saying , 45 Get you vp from among this
Congregation , that I may consume them , as in a moment :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1165

and they fell vpon their faces . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1166

46 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1167

And Moses said vnto Aaron , Take a censer ,

and make an atonement for them : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-H,16,40N.1172

for there is wrath gone out from the LORD ;
