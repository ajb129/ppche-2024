us all , but not make amends for y=e= loss of M=rs= Ibbings who danced
at Lincolns Inn Feild and is lately dead . ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,240.6

But as y=e= quallity of y=e= Ladys that dance at Court is not to be
compared w=th= so mean a person as a player , so I am shure most of
there indiferent danceing is not to be mentioned w=th= her good .

I take it , my L=d= , as very great honour y=t= you will trouble
y=r=self to write to me , ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.33

but when I consider how weak y=r= eyes are I had rather be w=th=out y=e=
happynys of y=r= Ld=sps= letters then have you in y=e= lest hurt y=r=
eyes . ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.34

I was last night <paren> w=th= Lady Longuevil and Lady Arundel <$$paren>
at y=e= Princess's , ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.35

and Lady Long: was so kind to offer to carry me to y=e= Oppera to_day
w=th= her and Lady Portland ; ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.36

but I was so unfortunate as to be engaged to go to Lady Denbighs to see
y=e= famous M=rs= Binges dance , ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.37

or els I should have bin glad to have waited on Lady Long: , tho I had
seen it before and think it very silly . ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.38

M=r= Abel is to have a fine musicke meeting to_morrow ,
ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.39

and y=e= tickets are guineas a piece , w=ch= is a little to much for me
to throw away ; ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.40

so I shall not be there , ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.41

and I find so many y=t= can afford it better of my mind , y=t= I fancy ,
if he had had lower rates , he would have got more .
ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.42

They say here y=t= M=rs= Reves is to have my Lord Leicester@ @s second
son , whom L=d= Romney designes to make his heir .
ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.43

T@ @is to be hoped he will use her better then his B=ro= did her sister
; ALHATTON-1700-E3-H,2,245.44

for , as the town sayes , he beat her w=th=in a week after she was
married , which I think should make this young lady afraid .
