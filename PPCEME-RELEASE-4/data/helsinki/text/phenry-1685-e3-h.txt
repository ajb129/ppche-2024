Dear heart , I continue very well , at present , thankes bee to God !
PHENRY-1685-E3-H,340.5

and feel nothing yet of the Inconveniences of a prison ;
PHENRY-1685-E3-H,340.6

we are better accommodated , as I acquainted you in my last , then wee
could have expected , though wee must pay for it .

<$$paren> neither morning , noon , nor night , w=ch= may turn to
Feavorish distempers , wanting exercise - I have not trodden on the
