<BEGIN_fisher-1521-e1-h>

<P_1,314>

The fyrste instruccyon is offerd vnto vs of these fyrst wordes of the
gospell . Quum venerit paracletus quem ego mittam vobis . spiritum
veritatis qui a patre procedit . In the whiche wordes is promest vnto
vs the spyryte of trouthe . to be our comforte in all doutefull
opinyons that may ryse in chrystes chirche . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.3

Touchynge this instruccyon thre thynges I wold do .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.4

First I wold shewe that the instruccyons of this holy gospell perteyneth
to the vniuersal chirche of chryst . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.5

Secondly that the heed of the vnyuersall chirche <em> iure diuino <$$em>
is the pope . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.6

Thyrdly that Martyn luther <paren> whiche deuydeth hymselfe from this
heed <$$paren> hath not in him the spiryte of trouth .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.7

For the fyrst martyn luther can not denye . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.8

but this promesse is made vnto the vnyuersall chyrche .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.9

& ther vnto we shall bynde hym by his owne reason .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.10

he sayth in the booke de captiuitate babilonica . Quod si demus vnam
aliquam epistolam Pauli . aut vnum alicuius epistole locum . non ad
vniuersalem ecclesiam pertinere . iam euacuata est tota Pauli
authoritas . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.11

that is to say yf we wyll afferme that any one epistle of saynt Paule .
or any one place of his epistoles . perteyneth not vnto the vnyuersall
chirche of chryst . we take away all saynt Paules authoryte .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.12

Now yf it be thus of the wordes of saynt Paule . moche rather this is a
trouthe of the gospels of christ . & of eury place wryten in the same
gospels . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.13

In the vniuersall chyrche than this holy spyryte of trouthe resteth .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.14

& shal contynue vnto the worldes ende . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.15

vt maneat vobiscum ineternum . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.16

he shall abyde in the vnyuersall chyrche for euer .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,314.17

et <P_1,315> docebit vos omnem veritatem . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.18

And he shall in euery doute teche vs the trouthe .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.19

Thus moche for the fyrst . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.20

Now for the seconde where I sayd that the pope iure diuino is the heed
of the vnyuersall chyrche of christ . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.21

whan ye se a tree stande vpright vpon the ground & his braunches spred
a_brode . full of leues . & fruyte . yf the sonne shyne clere . this
tree maketh a shadowe . in the whiche shadowe ye may perceyue a fygure
of the braunches . of the leues . & of the fruyte .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.22

Euery thynge that is in the tree . hathe somwhat answerynge vnto it in
the shadowe . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.23

And contrary wyse . euery parte of the shadowe hath some thynge
answerynge vnto it in the tree . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.24

A mans eye may leade hym from euery part of the tree . tyll euery parte
of the shadowe . & agayne . from euery parte of the shadowe tyll euery
parte of the tree . answerynge ther vnto . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.25

Euery man may poynt any certayne parte of the shadowe . & say this is
the shadowe of suche a braunche . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.26

& this is the shadowe of suche a lefe . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.27

& this is the shadowe of the bole of the tree .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.28

& this is the shadowe of the top of the tre . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.29

But so it is that the lawe of Moyses . & the gouernaunce of the
synagoge of the Iewes . was but a shadowe of the gouernaunce of the
vnyuersall chirche of christ . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.30

So sayth saynt Paule . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.31

vmbram habens lex futurorum bonorum . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.32

that is to say the lawe had but a shadowe of thynges for to come .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.33

And ad corinthios . omnia in figura contingebant illis .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.34

All theyr gouernaunce was but a fygure & shadowe of the chirche .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.35

Now than to my purpose . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.36

In the gouernaunce was twayne hedes appoynted . one vnder another .
Moyses & Aaron . to condyth that people thurgh the deserte . vnto the
controy that was promysed vnto them . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,315.37

we woot that that people <P_1,316> of the Iewes was a shadow of the
chrysten people . & that theyr Iorney by the desert . toward the
countre promysed vnto them was a shadow of our iourney . thrugh this
wretched world vnto the countre of heuen . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.38

But Moyses & Aaron whiche were the hedes of that people . wherof than
be they shadow ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.39

withouten doute they must be the shadowe of chryste & of his vycare
saynt Peter whiche vnder christ was also the heed of chrysten people .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.40

And wyll ye se this more manyfestly by .iij. lykenesses .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.41

Fyrste Moyses & Aaron bothe of them were preestes .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.42

Moyses was made by god . & Aaron made by Moyses at the commaundement of
god . to whom was commytted the cure of the Iewes in the absence of
Moyses . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.43

So christ & saynt Peter bothe were preestes of the new lawe .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.44

Chryst made by his father all_myghty god as it is wrytten of hym .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.45

Tu es sacerdos ineternum secundum ordinem Melchisedech .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.46

that is to saye thou art a preest for euer accordyng to the ordre of
Melchesidech . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.47

And Peter was made by christ . to whom he commysed in his absence the
cure of the christen people sayenge . pasce oues meas pasce . pasce .
pasce . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.48

The second likenes is this . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.49

Moyses was meane bytwene almyghty god and Aaron for the causes of the
people . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.50

& Aaron was meane bytwene Moyses & the people touchynge the causes of
god . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.51

So scrypture techeth Exodi . iiij . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.52

Almighty god sayd vnto Moyses spekynge of Aaron . Ipse loquetur pro te
ad populum . & erit os tuum . Tu autem eris ei in iis que ad deum
pertinent . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.53

that is to saye . he shall speke in thy stede vnto the people .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.54

& thou shalt be for hym agayn . in thoo causes that perteyne vnto god .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.55

wyll ye se how christ was the mouthe of Peter towardes almighty god .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,316.56

he sayd to saynt peter . Simon Simon ecce sathanas <P_1,317> expetiuit
vos , vt cribraret sicut triticum . Ego autem rogaui pro te vt non
deficiat fides tua . et tu aliquando conuersus confirma fratres tuos .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.57

that is to saye . Simon Simon lo Sathanas hath coueyted gretly to syft
you as a man syfteth his whete . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.58

But I haue prayed for the to th@ @entent that thy faythe do not fayle .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.59

And thou ones tourned to the stabyll waye conferme thy brethren .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.60

Se now here wheder chryst was not the mouthe of Peter whan he promoted
his cause . before almyghty god the father . & prayed for hym that his
faythe sholde not fynally perysshe . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.61

And contrary wyse was not Peter the mouthe of christ . whan he to the
true waye conuerted dyd conferme his brethren .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.62

here note well what authoryte was gyuen to Peter vpon them to conferme
all the other of his bretheren in the stabyll waye .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.63

The thyrde lykenes is this . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.64

Moyses ascended vnto the mounte to speke with almyghty god .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.65

and Aaron remayned behynde to instructe the people .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.66

Dyd not christ lykewyse ascend vnto his father vnto the grete mounte of
heuen ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.67

And to what entent I praye you ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.68

Saynt Poule telleth . vt appareat vultui dei pro nobis . to appere
before the face of almyghty god for vs . & there to be our aduocate as
sayth saynt Iohan . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.69

And dyd not Peter remayne behynde to teche the people . the whiche our
sauyour commytted vnto his charge . lyke as Aaron was lefte for to do
the people of the Iewes . whan Moyses was aboue in the mount with god .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.70

Thus euery man maye se how that shadowe & this thynge agreeth &
answereth one tyll another fully & clerly . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.71

But now let vs pause here a whyle . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.72

I wyll construe this fygure yet by another dede of christ in the gospel
. FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.73

So it was . that the Iewes were tributaryes vnto the romaynes .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.74

& for that tribute the heed of euery housholde dyd paye a certayne coyne
called didrachma . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,317.75

So whan they that <P_1,318> were the gaderers of this trybute came to
saynt Peter . our sauyour bad hym go vnto the see .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.76

And tolde hym that in a fysshes bely there he shold fynde staterem .
whiche was a double didrachma . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.77

and bad hym paye that vnto the gaderers . bothe for hymselfe and for
christ . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.78

Marke here that this trybute was heed money payed for them that were
heedes and gouernours of housholdes . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.79

& christ commaunded this to be payed for no moo . but onely for hym &
for saint Peter . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.80

& therby quyted all the resydue . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.81

Ioyne this facte of the gospell vnto that fygure byfore . & what can be
more euydent to shewe that Peter vnder christ was the heed of al the
houshold of christ . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.82

But yet thyrdly let vs here the testymony of some father of the chyrche
that this is the veray meanynge of the gospell .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.83

Saynt Austyn in the boke of questyons of the newe & of the olde
testament the .lxxv. questyon sayth in this maner . didrachma capitum
solutio intelligitur . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.84

the payment of this money was heed money payde for the heedes .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.85

And after foloweth . Saluator quum pro se et Petro dari iubet . pro
omnibus exoluisse videtur . quia sicut in saluatore erant omnes causa
magisterii . ita & post saluatorem in Petro omnes continentur . ipsum
enim constituit caput eorum . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.86

that is to saye . whan our sauyour commaunded this double trybute . to
be payed for hymselfe & for Peter . & in so commaundynge he dyd quyte
all the resydue of the apostles . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.87

for all they were conteyned in hym . bycause he was theyr mayster .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.88

And as al they were conteyned in our sauyour . So after our sauyour all
they were conteyned in Peter . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.89

For christ made hym the heed of them all . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.90

Here note of saynt Austyn that saynt Peter bycause he was heed of theym
all . & all they were conteyned in hym . therfore this trybute that
was payed for hym was payed for them al . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,318.91

But yet by an other scrypture whiche I rehersed <P_1,319> before .
Saynt Austyn proueth that all the other apostles were conteyned in saynt
Peter . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.92

Simon Simon . ecce sathanas expetiuit vos . vt cribraret sicut
triticum . Ego autem oraui pro te . vt non deficiat fides tua . et tu
aliquando conuersus confirma fratres tuos . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.93

that is to say . Symon Symon . loo sathanas hath coueyted to syft you
as a man syfteth whete . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.94

but I haue prayed for the that thy faythe shall not fayle .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.95

& thou ones conuerted to the stable waye . do conferme thy brethren .
Upon the whiche wordes saint Austin saythe . Christ dyd not praye for
Iames and Iohan & for the other . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.96

but he prayed for saynt Peter in whome the resydue was conteyned .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.97

Consyder now how eche of these testymonyes conferme & strengthe one
another . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.98

Fyrste the fygure & shadow of the olde lawe . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.99

Secondly the testymony of the gospels answerynge vnto the same .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.100

Thirdly the declaracyon of saynt Austyn vpon the same .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.101

And here I brynge but one doctour . whose testymony in the balaunce on
any trewe christen mans herte . me thynketh sholde weye downe Martyn
Luther . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.102

But saynt Ambrose spekynge de didrachmate calleth it also capitum
solutionem . that is to say heed money . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.103

And of saynt Peter he saythe . Petra enim dicitur . eo quod primus in
nationibus fidei fundamentum posuerit . & tanquam saxum immobile totius
operis christiani compagem . molemque contineat .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.104

that is to saye . Peter is called petra . bycause that he fyrste
amonge the gentyles dyd establysshe the grounde of our fayth .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.105

& as a stone not easy to be remoued . he conteyneth in hym & stayeth
all the frame & gretnes of the worke of christ .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,319.106

And saynt Gregory saythe . Certe Petrus apostolus primum membrum sancte
et vniuersalis ecclesie est . Paulus . Andreas . Ioannes quid aliud
quam <P_1,320> singularium plebium sunt capita .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.107

that is to saye . Peter is the chefe membre of the vnyuersall chirche .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.108

Paule & Andrew . & Iohan what els be they . but heedes of certayne &
synguler people . wherby it appereth that as they were chefe euery man
of the people that they had cure of . So saynt Peter was chefe of the
vnyuersall chyrche . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.109

Saynt Hierome also sayth spekynge of Peter . Propterea inter duodecim
vnus eligitur . vt capite constituto . schismatis tolleretur occasio .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.110

that is to say that Peter was one chosen out amongest twelfe to th@
@entent that he beynge theyr heed al occasyons of schysmatyke dyuysyon
sholde be take away . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.111

Saynt Cypriane forthermore sayth . spekyng of Peter whan he dyd
confesse cryst Iesu to be the sone of god . Loquitur illic Petrus super
quem edificanda fuerat ecclesia . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.112

that is to saye there speketh Peter vpon whome the chirche was for to be
buylded . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.113

But how shold the chirche be buylded vpon hym yf he were not the heed
and chefe membre of the chyrche . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.114

All these be of the latyn chyrche . holy fathers . all men of grete
lernynge . all men of synguler holynes . whose vertuous lyuynges be
confirmed by myracles bothe done in theyr lyfes & after theyr dethe .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.115

Of grekes lyke wyse . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.116

Chrysostome after that he hath praysed saynt Paule speketh of saynt
Peter sayenge . quod ipse qui fuit apostolorum caput talis fuit .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.117

that is to saye that saynt Peter whiche was the heed of the apostles was
suche another FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.118

and often he called saynt Peter eximium apostolorum . et os
discipulorum ac verticem collegii . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.119

that is to saye the chefe of the apostles and mouthe of the dyscyples &
the top and heed of all the college . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,320.120

And Orygene saythe . Magno illi ecclesie fundamento petreque
solidissime super <P_1,321> quam christus fundauit ecclesiam suam .
vide quid dicatur a domino . Modice fidei quare dubitasti .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.121

that is to say . Se what was sayd of our lorde to that grete foundament
of the chirche and moost stable stone . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.122

O man of lytle faythe why dydest thou doute .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.123

Yf all these so many testymonyes bothe of grekes and latyns shall not
counterpease agaynst one frere . what reason is this ?
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.124

I trust there is no true crysten man but that he wyll be moued with the
testimonye of all these . specyally whan they be grounded of so playne
& euydent a fygure of the olde lawe . and of so clere a lyght of the
holy gospels . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.125

But here Luther wyll saye that he can not conceyue duos summos . Of the
whiche I meruayle gretly . Sithen it is manyfest that Aaron was called
summus in scrypture . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.126

& yf he were summus sacerdos & Moyses was no whit benethe hym . than
must they two eyther of them be summus . one of them vnder another in
comparyson of the other people . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.127

So as saynt Paule maketh many hedes sayenge . Caput mulieris vir .
caput viri christus . christi vero deus . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.128

Se here be thre heedes vnto a woman . god , chryst , & hyr husbande .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.129

& yet besyde al these she hath an heed of hyr owne .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.130

It were a monstrous syght to se a woman withouten an heed .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.131

what comforte sholde hyr housbande haue vpon hyr .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.132

Yf than one woman not_withstandynge she hathe an heed of hyr owne to
gouerne hyr accordynge to the wyll & pleasure of hyr housband . yet she
hath hyr housbande to be hyr heed & chryst to be hyr heed . and god to
be hyr heed . How moche rather our mother holy chyrche which is the
spouse of christ . hath an heed of her owne . that is to saye the pope
. FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.133

and yet neuerthelesse chryst Iesu hyr housbande is her heed .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.134

& almyghty god is hyr heed also . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.135

But now let vs retourne to our instruccyon . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,321.136

Thus than ye vnderstande how that in the vnyuersall <P_1,322> chyrche of
chryste remayneth the spyryte of trouthe for euer . and that the heed
of this chyrche the pope is vnder chryst . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,322.137

By this breuely it may appeere that the spyryte of chryst is not in
Martyn luther . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,322.138

The spyryte of euery naturall body gyueth lyfe noo forther . but to the
members & partes of the same body . whiche be naturally ioyned vnto the
heed . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,322.139

And so lykewyse it must be in the mystycall body of our mother holy
chirche . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,322.140

For_asmoche than as this wretched man hath deuyded hymselfe from the
heed of this body . whiche is the vycare of chryst . how can he haue
in hym the spyryte of this body whiche is the spyryte of trouthe .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,322.141

& specyally whan he hath deuyded hymselfe with suche pryde , arrogancye
. & presumpcyon . whiche is moost odyous vnto this holy spyryte . and
so dyspytyously . so presumsttuously . so malycyously contemneth &
setteth at nought . & all to raggeth the heed of chrystes chyrche . to
whome as to his chefe spyrytuall father . by the reason of his relygyon
he hath vowed and promest obedyence . How can this man haue in hym the
spyryte of god this holy spyryte of trouthe .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,322.142

And here I make an ende of the first instruccyon .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,322.143

Here foloweth the seconde instruccyon agaynst the pernycyous doctryne of
Martyn luther . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,322.144

<P_1,396>

These fyue great woundes were ingraued with sharpe & vyolent pennes ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,396.146

that is to say , the sharpe nayles , and the speare .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,396.147

And they doe represent vnto vs the fyue capytall Letters of thys booke .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,396.148

Thus then you maye perceyue what bee the boardes of this booke , and
what be the leaues , how it is written within , and without , howe it is
lyned and leathered , and what bee the Letters , as well the small as
the great . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,396.149

Now wee shall heare what maner of wryting is contayned in thys booke .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,396.150

But first heere , let vs make our prayer for grace , beseechyng
almyghtie God , to gyue vnto our hartes the gracyous lyght of his beames
, whereby wee may the more clearely perceiue the writings of this booke
, and that they may bring foorth some good fruite to our soules health .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,396.151

Now you shall heare what wrytings be contayned in thys booke ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,396.152

in the booke which Ezechiel did see , was written three maner of things
, Lamentationes , Carmen , et vae , which is to say , Lamentations ,
songes , and woe . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,396.153

And the same three things , in lyke maner be wrytten in thys booke on
the Crucifixe . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,396.154

Fyrst is lamentation , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,396.155

and this verie conuenientlye is written in thys booke of the Crucyfixe .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,396.156

For whosoeuer will ioye <P_1,397> with Christ , must first sorow with
him . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.157

And by sorowe and lamentation hee may come vnto ioye :
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.158

But hee that will not sorrowe and lament wyth Christ heere in thys lyfe
, hee shall come fynallye to the place where is euerlasting woe , I saye
woe that shall neuer haue ende . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.159

Heere therfore is written all these three , lamentation , songe , and
woe . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.160

Fyrste then wee will speake of lamentation . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.161

Lamentation aryseth of foure affections , eyther of a great feare , or
dreade , or of a great shame , or of some sorrowe , or els of some
hatred . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.162

When Holophernes with a mightie power was entred into the countrey of
Iurie , & terribly threatned to distroy all before hym , the people were
in a greate feare and dreade to be oppressed ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.163

and so fell downe before almyghtie God , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.164

and with great lamentation , dyd call for hys helpe ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.165

omnis populus cecidit in faciem , adorantes dominum cum lamentatione et
fletu , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.166

all the people fell on theyr faces , worshyppyng our Lorde with weepyng
and lamentation . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.167

The cause of this lamentation , was the great dreade whych they were in
. FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.168

Heere first then let vs learne to dread , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.169

and doubtlesse thou Christian soule , thou mayest heere learne greater
matter of dread , then the Iewes then were in .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.170

For the Iewes then were onelye in perill of temporall death ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.171

thou arte in perill of euerlastyng death . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.172

Consider man how greeuouslie thou hast sinned : And also behold how
greeuously sinne was reuenged , and punished in the blessed bodye of
Christ . And thou shalt anon fynde here great cause and matter of dread
. FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.173

The storyes telleth of Cambises the King of Persia , that where one of
hys Iudges had giuen a false and a wrong iudgement , he depriued him of
hys offyce , and made an other in his place their Iudge after him .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,397.174

<P_1,398>

Furthermore bicause of hys falsehoode he caused him to be slayne , and
his skinne to be hanged vp before the place of the commen iudgement , to
the entent that this newe Iudge beholdyng the greeuous punishment of his
predecessor , might be ware of falshood , and alway dread to giue any
wrong iudgement . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.176

In like maner the Image of the Crucifix is hunge vp in euery Church , to
the entent that we may see how greeuouslie sinne was punyshed in that
most blessed bodye of our Sauyour Christ Iesu ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.177

not for him self , nor for hys owne sinne , but for ours was he thus
cruellye intreated , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.178

wee were the cause , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.179

wee committed the sinne . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.180

But yet neuerthelesse he bare the paynes , and burthens of our sinnes
vpon his backe . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.181

As wryteth Sainct Peter , Peccata nostra ipse pertulit in corpore suo
super lignum crucis . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.182

And therefore when we behold the Image of the Crucifixe in anye place
set vp , we should thynke howe greeuously sinne was punyshed in the body
of our sauiour Christ . And there by learne to dreade the greeuous
punishment of sinne . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.183

<paren> Alas <$$paren> man thynkest thou not , that thys was matter of
dreade . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.184

This I say , that the verie sonne of God , was for thy sinne put vnto
thys cruell death of the Crosse : FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.185

If thou beleeue not thys , thou arte worse then the dyuylles .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.186

For as Sainct Iames sayeth , demones credunt et contremiscunt , the
diuilles doe beleeue , and tremble . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.187

And if thou verely beleeue it , thou mayest thereby thynke and learne
howe muche our sauyour and hys father both doeth hate sinne .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.188

For sith almightie God the father woulde gyue hys moste dearely beloued
sonne vnto suche an horrible death , onely for to quenche and to
extincte sinne , thou mayest bee sure that he hateth sinne very much .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,398.189

Our Sauyour also must needes hate sinne when hee <P_1,399> rather would
suffer thys moste vyllanous death , then {he_would_suffer} that sinne
shoulde haue domynion vpon our soules , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,399.190

seeyng then that thow knowest that bothe they hate sinne ? Howe
shouldest thou dreade to receue any sinne into thy soule .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,399.191

If sinne were so displeasant to almighty God the father , that rather
then hee would suffer it , he would giue his owne sonne vnto death for
the expulsion of it . How much rather now doth it displease him , when
his sonne hath suffered death therfore , and yet sinne rayneth
neuerthelesse , and more generally then euer it dyd before .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,399.192

Furthermore , if sinne was so greuously punished in him that neuer did
sinne , how bytterly shall it be punished in thee O sinfull creature ,
the which haste done so many great outragious sinnes .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,399.193

Surely wher he hath one nayle in his handes & feete , thou sinfull
creature hast deserued one_hundreth . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,399.194

And for euery one thorne , that he suffred in his head , thou hast
deserued a_thousande . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,399.195

And for euery one lash that he felt of the scourges , thou art worthy to
haue innumerable . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,399.196

Who that deepely considerith this that I haue sayde , and with an
earnest study resorteth often to looke vppon this booke I maruell if he
doo not fynde here in , great cause and earnest matter of dread .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,399.197

Here also may euery sinner quicken his sinne , if any lie within his
breast , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,399.198

for it is maruell that a sinner can without shame beholde this blessed
Image ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,399.199

If a sinner call to remembrance his great vnkyndnesse , & repute the
same vnkyndenes any maner of vice , I trow that he wyl@ @be much ashamed
of his moste vnkynde and vngentle dealing against so louing a Lorde .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,399.200

Say to me thou sinful creature , wilt thou not looke that other men ,
when thou haste beene vnto them in anye thinge beneficiall , I saye ,
wylt thou not looke that <P_1,400> they shall be kynde and louing vnto
thee againe ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.201

And if any person be vnkynde vnto thee , wylt thou not rebuke him fully
, and lay it vnto his reproofe to make him ashamed thereof ?
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.202

I am suer that thou wylt . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.203

Now then let me see , wher is thy shame ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.204

beholde and vew euery part of this blessed body , what payne it endured
for thy sake ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.205

Seest thou not his eyes , how they bee fylled with blood and bytter
teares ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.206

Seest thou not his eares , how they be filled with blasphemous rebukes ,
and obprobrious words ? His cheeke & necke with buffets , his shoulders
with the burthen of the crosse ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.207

Seest thou not his mouth , how in his dryghnesse they would haue filled
it with Asell and Gaule ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.208

Seest thou not , how his backe is payned against the hard Crosse ?
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.209

Seest thou not his sydes , how they were skourged with sharpe whyps ?
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.210

Seest thou not his armes , how they were strayned by the violence of the
ropes ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.211

Seest thou not his handes , how they be nailed iust vnto the crosse ?
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.212

Seest thou not his legges , how they be wearyed with labour ?
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.213

Seest thou not his feete , how paynefully they stay and bere vp the
wight of his whole body ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.214

O most vnkinde sinner , all this he suffred for thy sake .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.215

No greater kyndes euer was , or could be shewed to thee by any creature
, then this which sweete Iesus dyd shewe for thee and for thy sake ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.216

& wher is now thy kindenes againe ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.217

No kyndnesse thou canst shewe , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.218

but much vnkyndnesse thou haste often shewed vnto him ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.219

and yet thou art not ashamed . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.220

Alas man where is thy shame ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.221

Thincke with thy selfe how many abhominable sinnes thou hast done
against his pleasure . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,400.222

I doo acertayne <P_1,401> thee that the least of them stryketh him more
paynefully vnto the hart then any vnkyndnesse that euer was done vnto
thee in all thy lyfe . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.223

For as Sainct Barnerd sayth in the person of Christ , when he hath
rehersed all the greeuous paynes of his passion , he putteth vnto these
wordes , Extat interius planctus pregrauior , quum te ingratum experior
, FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.224

that is to say , but inwardly mourning is much more greuous bicause I
perceue thou arte to me so much vnkynd . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.225

So many sinnes so much vnkyndnesse . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.226

And the more haynous , and the more accustomable that they bee , the
more abhominable is thyne vnkyndenesse . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.227

If the least of many of thy sinnes had come to lyght , and to the
knowledge of men , thou wouldest haue beene sore ashamed of them ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.228

Christ knoweth them , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.229

and saw thee doo them , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.230

for Omnia nuda et aperta sunt oculis eius , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.231

All thinges be naked and open before his eyes :
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.232

and yet thou art not ashamed of all thy vnkindnes .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.233

Alas man , heare what the King and Prophet sayth , Tota die verecundia
mea contra me est , et confusio faciei meae cooperuit me ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.234

All the day long my shame is before mee , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.235

and my face is couered with confusion . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.236

Thus sayd this holy Kinge , when our sauiour as yet had not suffered his
passion for him . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.237

This high poynte of kindenesse was not as yet shewed vnto this man by
our sauiour Christ , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.238

and he neuerthelesse was ashamed of his sinne .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.239

Thou hast peraduenture done much more outragious sinne ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.240

and hast been much more vnkynde after this his moste wonderfull passion
suffered for thy sake , then euer that king was ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.241

& that also maketh thy sinne much more horryble .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,401.242

Thou hast after thy promise made vnto him , falsified the same promise
and vntruely broken it , by <P_1,402> multiplying of many foule and
abhominable sinz , & by often renewing of the same .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.243

Thou dyddest promise once at the sacrament of baptisme to keepe thy
fayth & trueth vnto thy sauiour , & to forsake the diuel & all his works
? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.244

An honest man , or an honest woman would be much ashamed to brek their
promise , & specially to theyr friend ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.245

Albeit the worlde is now full of such lorrells , that doo no more regard
to break their promise , then to drink when they be drye .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.246

How often hast thou broken thy promise ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.247

Alas man learn to be ashamed and saye with the Prophet Esdras , Deus
meus , confundor et erubesco leuare faciem meam quoniam iniquitates
nostrae leuatae sunt super caput nostrum , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.248

that is to say , O my god I am confounden and ashamed to lyft vp my face
vnto thee , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.249

for our sinnes be rysen far aboue our heads .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.250

Ye women when there is any black spot in your faces , or any moole in
your kerchiues , or any myer vpon your clothes , be you not ashamed ?
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.251

yes forsooth syr ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.252

But I shall tell you , where of you ought to be ashamed .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.253

Surely if your sowls haue any spots of deadly sinne in them ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.254

for when our sauiour so dearely with his most precious bloud , & with
all these greeuous paynes dyd wash and wype , & clense our soules from
euery spot of deadly sinne , ye should be much ashamed to defyle them
againe ? FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.255

If you be ashamed for a foule myrie shoo , and not of a foule stincking
soule , ye make more dearer your shooes , then your soules .
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.256

If ye be ashamed of a spot in your clothes & haue no shame for many
great blots in your soules . What shal I say but Frons meretricis facta
est tibi ; noluisti erubescere , FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.257

that is to say , thou hast taken vpon thee the face of a brothell ,
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.258

thou wylt not be ashamed . FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,402.259

If thou then depely consider how many shameful blots of sinne be in thy
soule , before the eyes of almightie God , & all the glorious court of
heauen , & how by them thou hast <P_1,403> vtterly broken thy promise
vnto god , & committed so great vnkindnes against this moste louing
charitie , that was shewed vnto thee for thy loue & for thy sake by our
sauiour on the crosse I suppose thou shalt fynde matter , & cause of
great shame , if any sparkle of honesty be yet left in thy soule ?
FISHER-1521-E1-H,1,403.260
