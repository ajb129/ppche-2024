CHAP. II. IS A SURVEY OF THE ISLAND OF CANOREIN NEAR BOMBAIM .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,182.4

<$$heading>

Upon these scores it was not long before I was employed to wait on the
Father Superior of the <font> North <$$font> , a Learned Man , and a
<font> Spaniard <$$font> by Nation , of the Order of the Jesuits .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,182.6

The President commanded his own <font> Baloon <$$font> <paren> a Barge
of <P_I,183> State , of Two_and_twenty Oars <$$paren> to attend me and
one of the Council , to compliment the Father on the Island of <font>
Canorein <$$font> , parted from <font> Bombaim <$$font> by a Stream half
a Mile broad : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,183.7

Near our Landing-place stood a College , not inferior to the Building ,
nor much unlike those of our Universities , belonging to the Jesuits
here , more commonly callen <font> Paulistines <$$font> <paren> whose
Visitor was now my Patient <$$paren> , who live here very sumptuously ,
the greatest part of the Island being theirs . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,183.8

Our Entertainment was truly Noble , and becoming the Gravity of the
Society . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,183.9

After I had done my Duty , the Fathers accompanied us to the Barge ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,183.10

afore the College-Gate stood a large Cross , thwack'd full of young
Blacks singing Vespers : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,183.11

The Town is large , the Houses tiled ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,183.12

it is called <font> Bandora <$$font> . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,183.13

At our department they gave us Seven Guns , which they have planted on
the Front of their College for their own Defence ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,183.14

besides they are fitted with good store of Small Arms : Following
therein the Advice given by a Statesman to the King of <font> Spain
<$$font> , about the <font> Netherlands <$$font> ; That <font> if the
Society of the <$$font> Loyolists <font> were multiplied , their
Convents might serve for Castles <$$font> . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,183.15

<P_I,184>

In the middle of the River we had a pleasant Prospect on both sides ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,184.17

on <font> Bandora <$$font> side , the College , the Town , the Church of
St. <font> Andrew <$$font> a Mile beyond , FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,184.18

and upon the Hill that pointed to the Sea , the <font> Aquada <$$font> ,
Blockhouse , and a Church ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,184.19

on the other side , the Church of <font> Maijm <$$font> , with other
handsome Buildings . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,184.20

Curiosity led me a second time to visit the Island <font> Canorein
<$$font> , having obtained leave for a longer Stay :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,184.21

nor went I alone , some of the best Quality on the Island being led by
the same desire , joining themselves with me : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,184.22

We carried a Train of Servants , Horses , and <font> Palenkeens <$$font>
, which were ferried over before us ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,184.23

and we coming soon after , were met by the Fraternity , and conducted to
the Fathers , who detained us till Afternoon by a stately Banquet ,
shewing us the Civility of the Church and College , diverting us both
with Instrumental and Vocal Musick , and very good Wine . After which
we were dismiss'd and four Mile off <font> Bandora <$$font> were stopp'd
by the Kindness of the <font> Padre-@ <$$font> @Superior , whose Mandate
whereever we came caused them to send his <font> Recarders <$$font>
<paren> a Term of Congratulation , as we say , <font> Our Service
<$$font> <$$paren> with the Presents of the best Fruits and Wines , and
whatever we wanted . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,184.24

<P_I,185>

Here , not adjoining to any Town , in a sweet Air , stood a Magnificent
Rural Church ; in the way to which , and indeed all up and down this
Island , are pleasant <font> Aldeas <$$font> , or Country Seats of the
Gentry ; where they live like Petty-Monarchs , all that is born on the
Ground being theirs , holding them in a perfect state Villainage , they
being Lords Paramount . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.26

From hence , when we had baited , the same Night we travelled easily to
<font> Magatana <$$font> , using our Fowling-Pieces all the way , being
here presented with Rich Game , as Peacocks , Doves , and Pigeons ,
<font> Chitrels <$$font> , or Spotted Deer . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.27

When we came to the Town , two several Churches strove to receive us ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.28

but having some Acquaintance with the Father of the one , and not with
the other , we excused ourselves to the latter ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.29

and took up with our Friend . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.30

As soon as we came in , the Servitors fetch'd us warm Water to wash our
Feet , which was very refreshing ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.31

it put me in mind of <font> Lot's <$$font> Courtesy to the Angels .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.32

After this , as a piece of extraordinary Civility , they showed us the
Necessary House ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.33

and it is so in a Countrey where Fluxes are so common ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.34

and for that reason it is kept as neat as their Lodging Rooms , having
Water to Wash after you have used a clean Towel hung there for that
Purpose . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.35

This Night we fared very well . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.36

Next Morn before Break of Day we directed our Steps to the anciently
fam'd , but now ruin'd City of <font> Canorein <$$font> ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,185.37

the way to it <P_I,186> is so delightsome , I thought I had been in
<font> England <$$font> ; fine Arable , Pasture , and Coppices ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.38

thus we passed Five Mile to the Foot of the Hill on which the City
stands , FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.39

and had passed half a Mile through a thick Wood , peopled by Apes ,
Tygers , wild Buffolo's , and Jackalls ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.40

here were some Flocks of Parockets : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.41

When we alighted , the Sun began to mount the <font> Horizon <$$font>
over the Hills , FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.42

and under our Feet , as if he had newly bathed his fiery Coursers ,
there appeared the Mouth of a <font> Tank <$$font> , or Aqueduct , out
of a Rock , whose steaming Breath was very hot , but water cold :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.43

From hence it is thought the whole City to be supplied with Water ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.44

for as we ascend , we find such Places , where convenient , filled with
Limpid Water , not over-matched in <font> India <$$font> :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.45

If it be so , <paren> as I know not how to contradict it <$$paren> that
it should have its Current upwards through the hard Rocks artificially
cut , the World can@ @not parallel so wonderful a Water-course !
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.46

From hence the Passage is uneasy and inaccessible for more than two
abreast , till we come to the City , all cut out of a Rock ; where it is
presented <font> Vulcan's <$$font> Forge , supported by two mighty
Colosses , bellied in the middle with two Globes .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.47

Next a Temple with a beautiful Frontispiece not unlike the <font>
Portuco <$$font> of St. <font> Paul's <$$font> <font> West Gate
<$$font> : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.48

Within the Porch on each side stand two Monstrous Giants , where two
Lesser and one Great Gate give a noble Entrance ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.49

it can receive no Light but at the Doors and Windows of the Porch ,
whereby it looks more solemnly ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.50

the Roof is Arched , seeming to be born up by huge Pillars of the same
Rock , some Round , some Square , 34 in number .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.51

The <font> Cornish <$$font> Work of Elephants , Horses , Lions ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,186.52

at the upper end it rounds like a Bow ; near where stands a great
Offertory somewhat Oval , the Body of it <P_I,187> without Pillars ,
they only making a narrow Piatzo about , leaving the Nave open :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.53

It may be an_100 Feet in Length , in Height 60 feet or more .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.54

Beyond this , by the same Mole-like Industry , was worked out a Court of
Judicature <paren> as those going to shew it will needs give Names
<$$paren> or Place of Audience , 50 Feet square , all bestuck with
Imagery , well Engraven according to old Sculpture .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.55

On the Side , over against the Door , sate one Superintendent , to whom
the <font> Brachmin <$$font> went with us , paid great Reverence , not
speaking of him without a token of worship ; whom we called <font> Jougy
<$$font> , or the Holy Man ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.56

under this the way being made into handsome Marble Steps , are the
King's Stables , not different from the Fashion of our Noblemens Stables
, FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.57

only at the head of every Stall seems to be a <font> Dormitory <$$font>
, or Place for Devotion , with Images , which gave occasion to doubt if
ever for that End ; or rather made for an Heathen Seminary of Devotes ,
and these their Cells or Chappels , and the open Place their Common Hall
or School : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.58

More aloft stood the King's Palace , large , stately and magnificent ,
surrounded with lesser of the Nobility . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.59

To see all , would require a Month's time ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.60

but that we might see as much as could be in our allotted time , we got
upon the highest part of the Mountain , where we feasted our Eyes with
unnumerable Entrances of these Cony-burrows , but could not see one
quarter part . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.61

Whose Labour this should be , or for what purpose , is out of memory ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.62

but this Place by the <font> Gentiles <$$font> is much adored :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.63

Some contend for <font> Alexander <$$font> , FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,187.64

and as a proof , think they have said enough , when it is received by
Tradition , that <P_I,188> a great Gap out of a Solid Rock was cut by
him to make this an Island : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,188.65

But this is contradictory to the Story delivered of <font> Alexander
<$$font> , That he sailed up <font> Indus <$$font> , and encountred
<font> King Porus <$$font> , of whom some little Remains may be
collected , they speaking of that King by the Name of <font> Por
<$$font> in <font> Cambaia <$$font> , where <font> Alexander <$$font>
landed with his Army ; and followed the Course of <font> Indus <$$font>
, directly contrary to this Place , that lying <font> North-East
<$$font> , this <font> South <$$font> from thence ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,188.66

nor do we read his stay in <font> India <$$font> was so long , to
atchieve such Acts as these , this Place being not the only Instance of
this nature ; but more probable to be an Heathen <font> Fane <$$font> ,
or Idolatrous Pagod , from the Superstitious Opinion they still hold of
its Sacredness : Wherefore the <font> Portugals <$$font> , who are now
Masters of it , strive to erace the remainders of this <font> Herculean
<$$font> Work , that it may sink into the oblivion of its Founders .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,188.67

Returning to <font> Magatana <$$font> , we spent some days in riding
about the Country , which we found every-where provided with Churches .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,188.68

The Chief City of this Island is <font> Tanaw <$$font> : In which are
Seven Churches and Colleges , the chiefest one of the <font> Paulistines
<$$font> ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,188.69

the Houses Tiled , but low : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,188.70

Here are made good Stuffs of Silk and Cotton . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,188.71

There is another great Town called <font> Mein <$$font> , where is a
<P_I,189> Castle and some Soldiers , towards the Sea ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.72

over against <font> Baçein <$$font> there is another Fort and <font>
Aquada <$$font> . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.73

The <font> Portugals <$$font> suffer none but Christians here :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.74

It has no Rivers , but only Inlets of the Sea ; but good Springs from
the Rocks ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.75

the Ground excellently fertile , either of it self , or by the care of
the Inhabitants ; that it yields as good Cabbages , Coleworts , and
better Rhadishes than ever I yet saw : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.76

Besides Garden-Fruit , here are incomparable Water-Melons , and Onions
as sweet , and as well_tasted as an Apple ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.77

and for the natural growth of the Soil , it is known not only to supply
the adjoining Islands , but <font> Goa <$$font> also .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.78

It is more than 20 Miles in Length , and 70 in Circumference .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.79

CHAP. III . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.81

A VISIT TO BACEIN , A PORTUGAL CITY IN INDIA ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.82

OUR RETURN BY ELEPHANTO , AND THE PUTACHOS , WITH OBSERVATIONS ON THE
ISLAND BOMBAIM . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.83

<$$heading>

The several <font> Capitaneos <$$font> of the <font> Portugals <$$font>
are <font> Triennial <$$font> , which are the Alternate Governments
entailed on the Families of the Conquerors , and therefore made Circular
; every one in his course having his turn to rule in some Place or other
for Three Years , FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,189.85

and upon these they can borrow or take up Mony as certain as upon their
Hereditary <P_I,190> Estates the next Incumbent being Security for the
payment : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.86

Pursuant to this , a new Governour coming to <font> Choul <$$font> , his
Honour the President sent to congratulate him ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.87

and the Admiral of the <font> North <$$font> coming to <font> Baçein
<$$font> , another was sent on the same Message .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.88

Nor could the hot Months be over , before <font> John de Mendos <$$font>
, of a Noble Family , sent for me to <font> Baçein <$$font> for the cure
of his only Daughter , illustriously born , handsome , and on the point
of Marriage with the Admiral of the <font> North <$$font> , though not
full Twelve years old . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.89

Leaving <font> Bombaim <$$font> , at this time of the year , we could go
either within or without ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.90

but the first being related to be pleasantest I chose that way ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.91

sailing by <font> Trumbay <$$font> , where we receive Custom , we might
see a comely Church and <font> Aldea <$$font> : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.92

At Noon we reached <font> Tanaw <$$font> : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.93

Having gained our Passage over the Flats , we made no stay ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.94

but rowed streight to <font> Baçein <$$font> ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.95

every half Mile we were presented with fresh Prospects of delicate
Country-Mansions ; two of which of special note draw the Eyes of the
Beholders ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.96

one of <font> John de Melos <$$font> , three Mile off <font> Tanaw
<$$font> , it standing high , curiously built , has a Terras Descent
with Walks and Gardens half a Mile , till it lead to a spacious
Banquetting-house over the Water , with Stone-stairs for Landing :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,190.97

Beyond it a Mile , on the side of an Hill , stands <font> Grebondel
<$$font> , a large neat built Town of <font> Martin Alphonso's <$$font>
; <P_I,191> and at top of all , His House , Fort and Church , of as
stately Architecture as <font> India <$$font> can afford ; he being the
Richest Don on this side <font> Goa <$$font> . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,191.98

Here we are Land-locked by the Gut , which is fabled to be made by
<font> Alexander <$$font> ; from which we have an open passage to <font>
Baçein <$$font> , it lying bare towards the Sea .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,191.99

<heading>

BACEIN . <$$heading> Is incircled with a round Stone-wall ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,191.101

and has a Gate for every Wind ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,191.102

it is strong enough against the <font> Indians <$$font> , but not able
to endure an <font> European <$$font> Foe : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,191.103

There are upon the Out-walls , and in the Fort , Forty_two great Guns ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,191.104

the Fort in the middle of the City is circular ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,191.105

towards the Market appears a State-house Piatzed , where the Governour
convocates the <font> Fidalgos <$$font> every Morning upon consultation
, in which they all stand , a Chair not being permitted the Governour ,
though Gouty : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,191.106

Towards Evening they meet there to Game . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,191.107

<P_I,192>

Within the Walls are six Churches , four Convents , two Colleges , one
of the <font> Jesuits <$$font> , another of the <font> Franciscans
<$$font> . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.109

It bears the Name of an Academy ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.110

the Students are instructed in the <font> Jesuits <$$font> College ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.111

but live in Town : Where is a Library , with Classes of Historians ,
Moralists , Expositors , and no more . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.112

It is a College of Polite Structure , FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.113

in the <font> Portuco <$$font> is a Copy of <font> Angelos <$$font> ,
representing the Resurrection ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.114

above Stairs , as well as below , are fine square Cloisters , as all
their Collegiate Churches have on the sides whereof are their Cells ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.115

they have a spacious Refectory , and a goodly Church ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.116

three parts of the City is devoted to their use .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.117

The <font> Fidalgos <$$font> <paren> for few Artisans are tolerated
within the Walls <$$paren> have stately Dwellings , graced with covered
Balconies , and large Windows two Stories high , with Panes of Oister
shell , which is their usual Glazing among them in <font> India <$$font>
, or else Latised . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.118

They shew their Greatness by their number of <font> Sumbreeroes <$$font>
and <font> Cofferies <$$font> , whereby it is dangerous to walk late for
fear of falling into the Hands of those Pilfering Abusive Rascals .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.119

None but Christians lodge within the City , the <font> Banyans <$$font>
repairing to the Suburbs upon <font> Tattoo <$$font> .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.120

The City is a Mile and half round ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.121

it stands on an Island , separated by a small Channel from the Main , as
far off the Island <font> Canorein <$$font> , as <font> Canorein
<$$font> from <font> Bombaim <$$font> , and parted after the like nature
. FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.122

The Land about is plain , and fruitful of Sugar-Canes , Rice , and other
Grain ; a great part of which has lately been destroyed by the <font>
Arabs <$$font> of <font> Muschat <$$font> , who put them to a sore
fright in <font> Baçein <$$font> : FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,192.123

and this is done often , setting fire to their Villages , and carrying
away their <font> Fidalgos <$$font> Prisoners , together with their
Wives and Families , butchering <P_I,193> the <font> Padres <$$font> ,
and robbing the Churches without resistance , conceived on a deadly Feud
, partly out of revenge of the <font> Portugal <$$font> Cruelties at
<font> Muschat <$$font> ; but chiefly out of detestation of each other's
Religion ; insomuch that Quarter is denied on either side :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,193.124

But that on this Pretence . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,193.125

The <font> Portugals <$$font> striving to possess themselves of <font>
Muschat <$$font> , were put to such stress , that had not their <font>
Armado <$$font> come to their relief , they must have desisted their
Enterprize : Upon the arrival whereof the new Recruits gained so much on
the <font> Arab <$$font> Governour , that he yielded up the otherwise
invincible Fort of <font> Muschat <$$font> ; where the <font> Portugals
<$$font> acting all nefarious Outrages , contrary to their Promise , the
<font> Arabs <$$font> re-armed themselves with Courage and fresh Succors
, and at length beat them from hence to <font> Ormus <$$font> in the
Gulf of <font> Persia <$$font> ; from whence also they were routed by
the help of the <font> English <$$font> <paren> we then being at war
with them <$$paren> ; the first blow to their Greatness in these Parts .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,193.126

To check these Incursions of the <font> Arabs <$$font> , the <font>
Portugals <$$font> every Year are at the charge of a lusty Squadron in
these Seas , which were those we met on the Coast returning from thence
; who were no sooner gone , than the <font> Arabs <$$font> sent their
Fleet to do this Mischief here ; which now 't@ @is done , they are again
in quest of them , FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,193.127

but they fly as often as these pursue . FRYER-1677-E3-H,I,193.128

OUR SETTING FORTH FROM GOMBROON , AND LEAVING LHOR .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,177.132

<$$heading>

At last the Heavens drop Fatness , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,177.134

and the Showers refresh the Earth , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,177.135

and fill the Tanks with purer Water , washing away the old Filth and
Nastiness contracted by the former indispositions of the Seasons .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,177.136

And now we having this Opportunity , set forward towards the Evening of
the 28=th= of <font> June <$$font> , the Ships in the Road Saluting us ,
and the Merchants , both <font> French <$$font> and <font> Dutch
<$$font> , Conducting us onward of our Way , with Pomp and Ceremony ,
till we came to the Garden out of the City , where we entertained them
with a Sumptuous Treat , and took our Leaves ; they returning to <font>
Gombroon <$$font> , and we going on Three <font> Pharsangs <$$font> that
Night to <font> Band Ally <$$font> , <P_II,178> Inhabited only by Poor
People , in pitiful Cabbins covered with the Palm-Tree Boughs , by the
Sea-side , expecting Profit , as well by Strangers as by Fishery ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,178.137

these Houses are placed on Wheels , to draw up and down at their

<font> Band Ally <$$font> is the <font> Chast Ally <$$font> , to whom
this <font> Caravan_Seraw <$$font> is Dedicated , in the same manner as
we our Churches and places Sacred , to our Saints in Commemoration of
them . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,178.139

<font> Caravan_Seraw <$$font> , signifies no more than an Inn , <font>
viz. Ser <$$font> , the Head , <font> Raw <$$font> , of the Way .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,178.140

For this Journy we have no Wains for our Baggage , or Chariots for our
selves ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,178.141

we Ride on Horseback , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,178.142

and our Sumpters are Loaded on Mules , Asses , or Camels , which march
toward Evening and Travel till Morning ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,178.143

We go but slowly by reason of our Beasts of Burthen , though a greater
part of them were dispatched a Month before us by another Road , less
Mountainous , though farther about . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,178.144

Coming to our Inns , we have no Host , or Young Damosels to bid us
Welcome , nor other Furniture than Bare Walls ; no rooms Swept , nor
Cleanly Entertainment , Tables neatly Spred , or Maidens to Attend with
Voice or Lute to Exhilarate the Weary Passenger ; but instead of these ,
Apartments covered with Dung and Filth ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,178.145

Musick indeed there is of Humming Gnats pricking us to <P_II,179> keep
an unwilling Measure to their Comfort : So that here is neither
Provision for Man or Beast , only an open House , with no enlivening
Glass of Pontack , or Poinant Cheer to encourage the Badness of the
March ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,179.146

but every Four or Five <font> Pharsangs , i.e. Parasangae <$$font> , a
<font> German <$$font> League , on the King's High way , a <font>
Caravan_Ser_Raw <$$font> , as dirty as <font> Augeus <$$font> his Stable
, those before always leaving the next comer work enough to cleanse
where they have been ; that after coming in Tired , they are more intent
to spread their Carpets for Repose , than remove the incrustated Cake of
Sluttery , the constant Nursery of Flies and Beetles , they often
bringing their Horses into the same Bed-Chamber .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,179.147

These Houses Built by Charitable Persons , are always supplied with
Tanks and Cisterns , which now run over since yesterdays Rain , and are
commonly very Fine and Costly ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,179.148

but other Commodities we must bring with us , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,179.149

otherwise we are likely not only to go to Bed on the bare Ground , but
depart more Hungry than we came thither <paren> very few Places
maintaining Sutlers for Horse-meat , or Diet for the Wayfaring Man
<$$paren> : FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,179.150

Therefore when we undertake this Journy , we carry not only all our
Family , but Housholdstuff too ; for which every one has a separate
Allowance for his Servant and his Baggage , and a Butler in common , who
Mounts the <font> Trojan <$$font> Horse , supplied with Bread , Wine ,
Salt , Cold Meat , Knives and Napkins for the <font> Viaticum <$$font> ,
in Two Canisters , or Chests hung on each side one , under whose Belly
is girt a <font> Metarrah <$$font> , or Goat Skin full of Wine , and
another of Water ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,179.151

a <font> Metarrah <$$font> full of the latter every one ties to his
Horses Saddle , in the fashion of a Leathern Bottel , and a Silver Toss
, or Cup , in a Case at <P_II,180> the Bow of the Saddle :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,180.152

In the middle of the <font> Munsel <$$font> <paren> <font> i.e.
<$$font> a whole Day's Journy <$$paren> the Butler alights ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,180.153

and by some advantageous Brook , or Tank , spreads a Table on the Ground
, while the whole <font> Caphala <$$font> refresh :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,180.154

<paren> We generally make our <font> Munsel <$$font> from Four in the
Afternoon till before Four in the Morning <$$paren> when after a Glass
of Wine , and the Fragments of yesterdays Provisions , we betake our
selves to Rest with much eagerness , if it be possible among so many
strange Customs at first ; as Noise of Carriers Bells , Feeding ,
Neighing , Breying , and Noise of so many Creatures , Loading and
Unloading , with the Singing , Chatting , and Din of Servants ,
Horse-keepers and Muliteers ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,180.155

but Custom makes all things familiar and easy , that we generally Repose
till Two the next Day ; when our Cook has provided not only our Dinner
<paren> which is as Sumptuous as if at Home , and brought in with the
same Order <$$paren> but furthermore , our necessary Provant for the
ensuing Day's Journy ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,180.156

and after this manner are we fitted to measure out our future Hardships
. FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,180.157

Hither the <font> Banyans <$$font> , or <font> English <$$font> Brokers
, Accompanied us , they taking their Leave for the Port , we keeping on
our Course , Three <font> Englishmen <$$font> with our Retinue
answerable to the Quality of each ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,180.158

we had with us Twenty Camels for Lumber , Fifteen Horses , Three Mules ,
and Two Asses , besides Three <font> Shotters <$$font> for our Guides ,
which are the only <P_II,181> Men here also , who wear Plumes of
Feathers in their Turbats , small Bells about their Wastes , Truncheons
in their Hands , Horse-Cloaths over their Shoulders richly Embroidered
on Scarlet , Packthread Shoes on their Feet , and close Jerkins with
Breeches below their Knees ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.159

these are our Guides , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.160

and hold our Horses while we Mount , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.161

look after them and the Equipments , as Bridles and Furniture , <paren>
the most mean of which are Silver <$$paren> when we alight ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.162

and are not only swift , but lasting Footmen .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.163

Beginning to set forward , neither Tract nor Road was followed , all
being covered with Sand ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.164

but our Guides steered by their own Experience ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.165

this was not so comfortable , to behold nothing but a Sea of Sand ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.166

for now we began to turn our back upon the Gulf , and steer a more
<font> Northern <$$font> Course , from whence to reflect what Sustenance
this barren Earth could produce , that , should our Stores fail , we
might want ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.167

yet even for this Jealousy we had not the least shadow of Reason ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.168

for had we been less provided we might have met with Plenty , every one
striving to Vend us Necessaries , to the no small encrease of my
amazement how they came by them . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.169

After we had waded through Two <font> Pharsangs <$$font> of this
Desolate Way , we began to Clamber up those Hills , which seem hanging
over the Road of <font> Gombroon <$$font> , now beating the Hoof on more
solid Rocks : FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,181.170

In this Passage we could here and there descry some Groves of Palms ,
whose Fruit were tinctured with a Cherry Red , the constant forerunner
of their full Maturity ; at which time they look for the same
Unhealthiness we do in our Autumn ; though I find <P_II,182> them not so
superstitiously addicted to Symbols , as the <font> Egyptians <$$font>
to their Hieroglyphicks , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,182.171

they express the Year by this Tree ; because this Tree , say they , of
all others alone <paren> which I before noted of the Coco-Nut Tree , and
therefore I think it a kind of Palm <$$paren> at every appearance of the
New Moon procreates a fresh Branch , by which Twelve Productions the
whole Year is resembled and compleated ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,182.172

the Trees are Tall and Slender , bearing their Boughs all atop , like a
shady Tuft , some standing bolt upright , and others spread abroad ,
with others flagging and ready to give way to the Birth of more ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,182.173

when they are Young and in their Infancy , they no sooner sprout up but
the prickly Leafs guard its tender Head , which is of a pithy substance
, and when Wounded spoils the Trees Growth , so that it Dies ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,182.174

but while it escapes that danger , it rises by degrees after the former
Order , the under Branches bowing Archwise to their upstart Youngsters ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,182.175

the Leafs are set in Rows like Ribs to a great Spine , arising from a
Circular Base , till it end in a sharp Point ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,182.176

under these Boughs the mighty Branches hang full of Dates in Clusters ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,182.177

and which is more than <font> say_so <$$font> , <font> The more they@
@'r Burthened better do they Thrive , Like depress'd Virtue better kept
alive . <$$font> FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,182.178

So patient under great Loads of this Fruit , that they seem to rejoyce
with a more chearful Verdure , and unconcerned reject the withered
Boughs , whilst a more lively Product makes them glad by a new
Succession ; by which means it keeps Green the whole Course of the Year
. FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,182.179

Nor when the old ones fall , are these only fit for the Fire ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,182.180

for they being orderly laid , and finely Gilded or Painted between the
Beams of the same Wood , supply the Ceilings and other adornments of
their best Houses ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,182.181

<P_II,183>

nor are they less serviceable to Thatch their meaner Cottages :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,183.183

The Trunk being deprived of those Combings , from the main Head is
beheld a flourishing Peruke of Palms , fit to be worn by the greatest
Heroes ; from whence downwards without any Sprouts , it appears all in
Coat of Mail Cap-a-pee {COM:sic} , or like a Pine-Apple from its scaly
Structure , caused by the falling of the precedent Branches , by which
compactness it emulates its Conelike Figure .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,183.184

Of these Trees there are Male and Female , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,183.185

and which is worthy our Notice , the Female Palms <paren> which only
Bear <$$paren> will not Bring forth before they are Impregnated at the
Roots with the Seed of the Male , first pounded into Meal and sprinkled
about them ; which how true I dispute not ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,183.186

but certainly Tradition has confirmed the Practice ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,183.187

and they are not to be persuaded to neglect the Custom .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,183.188

In the midst of this Days <font> Munsel <$$font> , among the Mountains
we passed by the Mouth of an horrid Cave ; where they entertain
Travellers with Tragick Stories , and a Legend of Fables , as that it is
the Road to Hell ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,183.189

for , say they , whoever Enters never Returns ; as if thence had arose
the Proverb , <font> No Redemption from the Shades <$$font> ; or that of
the Poet , - Facilis descensus Averni ; Sed revocare gradus , hic labor
, hoc opus est . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,183.190

Easy the Descent@ @'s to Hell , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,183.191

but back again Our steps to call , this is the Work , the Pain .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,183.192

<P_II,184>

But it stuck not on my Fancy , who had been informed of Pleasanter
Stages on that Journy , and an higher way to more open Doors . -
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,184.194

Patet Atri janua Ditis . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,184.195

Hell Gate wide open stands . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,184.196

But it may more probably be an Invention to fright Passengers into the
right Way , and that they should avoid , by so sad and terrible a Remark
, the wrong , which would wilder them in an unlucky Maze ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,184.197

for here the Way was not only Intricate but Difficult ; whereby I was
encouraged to auspicate a more Coelestial Path might lead us to <font>
Getche <$$font> , in the <font> Turkish <$$font> Language signifying a
<font> Goat <$$font> Village ; which was on Wheels , as the other ,
being not Twenty Miles distant ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,184.198

it is in a Sandy Valley full of Shrubs , on which the Camels Feed , but
the Asses , Mules , and Horses , on Barly and chopt Straw ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,184.199

<paren> the <font> Persians <$$font> learn'd the <font> Indians <$$font>
how to Treat their Horses ; where having declared the manner , I forbear
here , it being exactly the same <$$paren> FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,184.200

for these Eight or Nine <font> Munsels <$$font> they care not to House
them , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,184.201

but only Cover them with <font> Yawpengees <$$font> , <P_II,185> or
Horse-Cloths , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,185.202

and expose them to the open Air ; which is not so Unhealthy for them ,
as for Human Bodies , who carefully prevent such Lodgings for fear of
Aches , and other Inconveniences incident thereupon ; wherefore in the
middle of the Vale we repaired to the <font> Caravan_Ser_Raw <$$font> ,
almost buried in the Sand , it being the only obstacle to their rowling
Billows . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,185.203

The next Morn we were waited on by the Country Women bringing us Cheese
, and Butter made before our Eyes , with no other Churn than a Goatskin
, in which they shook the Milk till Butter came ; Fish , Roots , and
Herbs , with all sorts of Pullen : FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,185.204

In these Two <font> Munsels <$$font> we only meet with these Servitors ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,185.205

in other Places Men appear alone , not allowing their Women that Freedom
; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,185.206

but were they no more tempting than these Swains , they@ @'d have small
cause for the Restriction ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,185.207

for they are Strapping Sunburnt Lasses , with little more Cloaths on
than a dark_coloured Smock , or Frock ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,185.208

and for their Meen it is not enticing ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,185.209

these bring us Water to Drink out of their Tanks , newly filled , which
was Thick , Troubled , and Slimy ; for which reason the Vapours , or
rather Fumes from the Sun's violence , were very Offensive , and the
more irksome , because we were constrained to tarry here another Night ,
for that the River <font> Rute Conna Shure <$$font> ; or Salt-Water ,
was now overflown by the Waters falling from the Mountains beyond the
Banks to that excess , that it could not be Forded by Travellers ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,185.210

and the Stream ran with that Rapidness , that it was unsafe to venture
over till the descending Cataracts <P_II,186> had left off pouring on
the overswell'd Brinks , and emptied themselves into the wider Gulf ,
not many Leagues distant hence . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,186.211

The Day after , as soon as we heard the Waters were abated , we set
forward , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,186.212

and found it true what had been reported <paren> Three <font> Caphala's
<$$font> not daring to pass the Lake , where they had lain some Days ,
till we had led the way <$$paren> . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,186.213

It was sultry Hot when we assayed to go , FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,186.214

but Delays in this case were dangerous ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,186.215

besides , we were uncertain whether it would hold up should we tarry ,
which made us confide on our Guides , who gave us assurance , that the
Marshes were passable ; FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,186.216

we were more troubled with Waves of Sand than Water , both which , by
Rain , or Wind , keep on their course with some noise till silenced in
the <font> Persian <$$font> Gulf . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,186.217

Athwart this Fen , which was upward of Three Miles , was Built not long
since , as by the Modern Architecture may be guessed , a stately Stone
Bridge with Arches , on which high Banisters with Niches , and a brave
paved Cawsey Elegantly Built , which kept pace with us ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,186.218

but by the Negligence of these People , as well as Injury of Floods and
Sands , it was broke down in several places , especially where the
Torrent made the deepest Channel , so that though firm and strong in the
greatest part of it , yet by its being ruined in the most needful , it
is become impassable ; and though a Work of extraordinary Benefit and
Charge , yet already rendred of little Use . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,186.219

<P_II,187>

The rest of this day's Journy was between the Mountains , where we were
encounter'd by strange Flashes of Lightning , the Foretellers of this
Night's Rain , which we hardly escaped before we came to <font>
Caurestan <$$font> , in all Twenty Miles : FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,187.221

This <font> Caravan_Ser_Raw <$$font> is named from a Tree growing here ,
and a Village properly so called <paren> of which it is a Composition in
<font> Persian <$$font> <$$paren> , it being the first we met with whose
Houses were fixed . FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,187.222

The following Day we continued going between two Chains of Dry and Burnt
Hills , through a stony Valley , not without fear of suffocating ,
although it was near Evening e're we set out , and Yesterday's Showers
had benignly distilled on the Fiery Drought , to cool the parched Earth
: FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,187.223

But this is the dreadful Vale , where when the Hot <font> North <$$font>
Winds blow at this time , it sweeps both Men and Beasts away , either by
Night or Day , the Heat being as intense and as intolerable as that from
the Mouth of an Oven : FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,187.224

We were conducted through this Furnace by the Divine Protection <paren>
without being put to make use of the common Remedy in this Exigency ,
which is , upon perceiving of the hot Blasts , to cast our selves flat
on the Ground till they are over , thereby to prevent the Fate attending
those who refuse to stoop to this known Prescription , which is , to
fall down dead , never to rise more alive <$$paren> , till we were
<P_II,188> mounted where these two Chains are linked to each other ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,188.225

and by their mutual Ascent we were lift up on high ,
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,188.226

and then gently descending we were led down to <font> Goorbazergum
<$$font> , Fifteen miles from <font> Caurestan <$$font> .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,188.227

In this Bottom is a solitary Inn , very commodiously seated ;
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,188.228

it is surrounded with Mountains , at whose Bottoms are store of
Water-Melons , a grateful Cooler in this Extremity of Heat :
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,188.229

<font> Goor-Bazergum <$$font> is as it were to say , <font> The
Merchants Grave <$$font> , in the <font> Persian <$$font> Tongue .
FRYER-1677-E3-H,II,188.230
