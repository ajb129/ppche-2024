SAMUELL . DANIELL . THE WIFE OF SAMUELL . M. B. SCHOOLEMAISTER .
THE GOOD WIFE R. GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.5

<$$heading>

<font> Sam. <$$font> You are well mette olde acquaintance ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.7

I am glad to see you looke so well , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.8

howe doe all our good friendes in your Countrey .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.9

<font> Dan. <$$font> I trust they be all in good health ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.10

they were when I came from home , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.11

I am sorry to see you looke so pale , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.12

what haue you beene sicke lately ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.13

<font> Sam. <$$font> Truely no , I thanke God I haue had my health
pretily well , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.14

but yet me thinke my meate doth me no good of late .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.15

<font> Dan. <$$font> What is the matter man , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.16

doe you take thought and care for the world ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.17

take heede of that , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.18

for the Scripture saith , worldly sorrow worketh death . <font> 2.
Cor. 7. 10. <$$font> GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.19

It is a great sinne rising from vnbeleefe , and distrust in Gods
prouidence , when men be ouer_pensiue for the world .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.20

<font> Sam. <$$font> In deede my minde is troubled , but not for that
which you say , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.21

for I hope in God I shall not want so long as I liue .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.22

<font> Dan. <$$font> Is it any trouble of conscience for sinne ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.23

If it be , that may turne to good . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.24

<font> Sam. <$$font> O , no , no . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.25

I know no cause why . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.26

<font> Dan. <$$font> Why , what is it then , if I may@ @be so bold ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4R.27

I pray <P_A4V> you tell me . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.28

I thinke you take me for your friend . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.29

<font> Sam. <$$font> In deede I haue alwaies found you my very good
friend , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.30

and I am sure you will giue me the best counseil you can ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.31

truely we dwell here in a bad countrey , I think euen one of the worst
in England . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.32

<font> Dan. <$$font> Is it so ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.33

I thinke you dwell in a fine countrey , in a sweete wholesome aire and
fruitfull grounds . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.34

<font> Sam. <$$font> Aire man ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.35

I finde no fault with the aire , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.36

there be naughty people . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.37

<font> Dan. <$$font> Naughty people ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.38

where shall a man dwell , and not finde them ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.39

Swearers , liars , raylers , liaunderers , drunckards , adulterers ,
riotous , vnthriftes , dicers , and proude high_minded persons , are
euery where to be founde in great plenty . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.40

<font> Sam. <$$font> Nay , I doe not meane them ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.41

I care not for them . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.42

These witches , these euill_fauoured old witches doe trouble me .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.43

<font> Dan. <$$font> What doe you take your selfe to be bewitched ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.44

<font> Sam. <$$font> No , no , I trust no euill spirite can hurt me ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.45

but I heare of much harme done by them : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.46

they lame men GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.47

and kill their cattle , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.48

yea they destroy both men and children . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.49

They say there is scarce any towne or village in all this shire , but
there is one or two witches at the least in it .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.50

In good sooth , I may tell it to you as to my friend , when I goe but
into my closes , I am afraide , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.51

for I see nowe and then a Hare ; which my conscience giueth me is a
witch , or some witches spirite , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.52

shee stareth so vppon me . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.53

And sometime I see an ugly weasell runne through my yard ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.54

and there is a foule great catte sometimes in my Barne , which I haue no
liking vnto . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.55

<font> Dan. <$$font> You neuer had no hurt done yet , had you by any
witch ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.56

<font> Sam. <$$font> Trust me I can@ @not tell ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.57

but I feare me I haue , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,A4V.58

<P_B1R>

for there be two or three in our towne which I like not , but especially
an old woman , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.60

I haue beene as careful to please her as euer I was to please mine own
mother , and to giue her euer anon one thing or other ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.61

and yet me thinkes shee frownes at me now and then .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.62

And I had a hogge which eate his meate with his fellowes and was very
well to our thinking ouer night , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.63

and in the morning he was starke dead . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.64

My wife hath had fiue or sixe hennes euen of late dead .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.65

Some of my neighbours wishe me to burne some thing aliue , as a henne or
a hogge . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.66

Others will me in time to seeke helpe at the handes of some cunning man
, before I haue any further harme . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.67

I wold be glad to do for the best . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.68

<font> Dan. <$$font> Haue you any cunning man hereabout , that doth
helpe ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.69

<font> Sam. <$$font> There is one , they say , here a_twenty miles of
at <font> T. B. <$$font> which hath holpe many .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.70

And thus much I know , there was one of mine acquaintance but two miles
hence , which had great losses , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.71

he lost two or three kine ; six hogs , he would not haue tooke fifteene
shillings a hog for them , and a mare . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.72

He went to that same man , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.73

and told him hee suspected an old woman in the parish .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.74

And I think he told me , that he shewed him her in a Glasse ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.75

and tolde him shee had three or foure imps , some call them puckrels ,
one like a gray catte , an other like a weasell , an other like a mouse
, GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.76

a vengeance take them , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.77

it is a great pitty the countrey is not ridde of them ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.78

and told him also what he shoulde doe , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.79

it is halfe a yeare agoe , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.80

and he neuer had any hurt since . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.81

There is also a woman at <font> R. H. <$$font> fiue_and_twenty miles
hence , that hath a great name , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.82

and great resort there is dayly vnto her . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.83

A neighbour of mine had his childe taken lame , a girle of ten yeares
olde , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.84

and such a paine in her backe , that shee could not sit upright .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.85

He went to that woman , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.86

she tolde him he had some badde neighbour , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.87

the childe was forespoken , as he suspected ; GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1R.88

marry if he would goe home , and bring her som of the clothes which the
child <P_B1V> lay in all night , shee would tell him certainely .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.89

He went home , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.90

and put a table Napkin about her necke all night ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.91

and in the morning tooke it with him , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.92

and shee told him the girle was bewitched in deede ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.93

and so told him what hee should doe , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.94

and he had remedy , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.95

the girle is as wel at this day , and a pretty quicke girle .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.96

There was another of my neighbours had his wife much troubled ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.97

and he went to her , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.98

and shee tolde him , his wife was haunted with a fairy .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.99

I can@ @not tell what she bad him doe , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.100

but the woman is mery at this howre . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.101

I haue heard , I dare not say it is so , that shee weareth about her
Sainct <font> Iohns <$$font> Gospel , or some part of it .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.102

<font> Dan. <$$font> If you haue such cunning men and women , what
neede you be so much afraide ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.103

<font> Sam. <$$font> Alas man , I could teeme it to goe ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.104

and some counsell me to goe to the man at <font> T. B. <$$font> and
some to the woman at <font> R. H. <$$font> GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.105

And betweene them both I haue lingred the time ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.106

and feare I may be spoiled before I get remedy .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.107

Some wishe me to beate and claw the witch vntill I fetch bloud on her ,
and to threaten her that I will haue her hanged ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.108

if I knew which were the best I would doe it .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.109

<font> Dan. <$$font> I perceiue your danger is betweene two stooles .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.110

<font> Sam. <$$font> It is very true , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.111

if I had heard but of one , I should haue gone ere this time ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.112

and I am glad that I met with you . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.113

I pray you let me haue your best counsell ; GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.114

I trust you beare me good will . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.115

<font> Dan. <$$font> Truely I will giue you the best counsell I can ,
which I am sure shall doe you good , if you will followe it ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.116

for in deede I pitty your case , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.117

it is most certaine you are bewitched . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.118

<font> Sam. <$$font> Bewitched , doe you thinke I am bewitched ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.119

I feele no harme in my body , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.120

you make me more afraide . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B1V.121

<font> Dan . <$$font> Nay I doe not thinke that the olde woman hath
bewitched you , or that your body is bewitched , but the diuell hath
bewitched your minde , with blindnes and vnbeleefe , <P_B2R> to draw you
from God , euen to worship himselfe , by seeking help at the hands of
deuils . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.122

It is a lamentable case to see how the deuill hath bewitched thousands
at this day to run after him : and euen to offer sacrifice vnto him .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.123

<font> Sam. <$$font> I defie the deuill , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.124

worship him ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.125

fie vpon him , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.126

I hate him with all my hart . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.127

Do you thinke any seeke help at his hands ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.128

we seek help against him . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.129

I think he neuer doth good , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.130

he hurteth , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.131

but he neuer helpeth any . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.132

<font> Dan. <$$font> It is not in these matters to be taken as wee
imagine , but as the word of God teacheth . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.133

What though a man think he worshippeth not deuils , nor seeketh not help
at their handes , as he is persuaded , nor hath any such intent , is he
euer the neere , when as yet it shall be found by Gods word , that he
doth worship them , and seek vnto them for help ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.134

<font> Sam. <$$font> Doe you thinke then that there be no witches ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.135

Doth not God suffer wicked people to do harme ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.136

Or doe you thinke that the cunning men doe helpe by the deuill ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.137

I would be glad to reason with you , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.138

but I haue smal knowledge in the scripturs . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.139

We haue a Schoolemaister that is a good pretie scholler , they say , in
the Latine tongue , one M. <font> B. <$$font>
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.140

he is gone to my house euen now , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.141

I pray you let me intreat you to go thither , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.142

you two may reason the matter , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.143

for you are learned . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.144

<font> Dan. <$$font> I could be content , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.145

but it will aske some time , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.146

and I am going to such a place vpon speciall busines .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.147

<font> Sam. <$$font> I pray you let mee intreat you :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.148

foure or five houres is not so much . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.149

<font> Dan. <$$font> Well , I will goe with you .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.150

<font> Sam. <$$font> Wife , I haue brought an olde friend of mine ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.151

I pray thee bid him welcome . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.152

<font> The wife . <$$font> He is verie welcome .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.153

But trulie man , I am angrie with you , and halfe out of patience , that
you go not to seeke helpe against yonder same olde beast
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.154

I haue another hen dead this night . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.155

Other men can seeke remedy . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2R.156

<P_B2V>

Here is M. <font> B. <$$font> tels me , that the good wife <font> R.
<$$font> all the laste weeke could not make her butter come .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.158

She neuer rested vntil she had got her husbande out to the woman at R.
H. GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.159

and when he came home , they did but heat a spit red_hotte , and thrust
into the creame , vsing certaine wordes , as shee willed him ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.160

and it came as kindly as anie butter that euer she made .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.161

I met the old filth this morning GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.162

Lord , how sowerlie she looked vpon me , & mumbled as she went ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.163

I heard part of her wordes . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.164

Ah <paren> quod she <$$paren> you haue an honest man to your husband ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.165

I heare how he doth vse me . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.166

In trueth , husband , my stomacke did so rise against her , that I
coulde haue found in my heart to haue flowen vpon her , and scratched
her , but that I feared she would be too strong for me .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.167

It is a lustie olde queane . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.168

I wished that the good wife R. had bene with me .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.169

I pray you , good husbande , let me intreat you to goe to that same good
woman , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.170

you may ride thither in halfe a day . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.171

<font> Sam. <$$font> Wife , I pray thee be content ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.172

I haue intreated this mine olde friend to reason with M. <font> B.
<$$font> GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.173

for he tels mee that we be in a verie foule errour .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.174

<font> M. B. <$$font> I suppose , so farre as my learning and
capacitie doe extend , that small reasoning may serue .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.175

The worde of God doeth shew plainlie that there be witches ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.176

& commaundeth they should be put to death . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.177

Experience hath taught too too manie , what harmes they doe .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.178

And if anie haue the gift to minister help against them , shall we
refuse it ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.179

Shall we not drinke when we are a thirst ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.180

Shall wee not warme vs when wee are a colde ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.181

It is pitie that anie man should open his mouth anie way to defend them
, their impietie is so great . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.182

<font> Dan. <$$font> For my part , I go not about to defend witches ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.183

I denie not but that the deuill worketh by them . And that they ought
to be put to death . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.184

We ought also to seeke remedie against them : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B2V.185

but as I told my friend , the deuil doth bewitch men by meanes of these
witches , and lead them <P_B3R> from God , euen to follow himself , to
offer sacrifice vnto him to worship him , to obey his wil , to commit
manie grieuous sinnes , and to be drowned in manifold errours .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.186

<font> M. B. <$$font> If you haue this meaning , that witches and
sorcerers ar bewitched by the deuil , that they forsake God , and follow
him , that they worship and obey him , and doe sacrifice vnto him , and
commit manie hainous sinnes , I agree with you ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.187

for I tak it , they euen vow themselues to the deuill ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.188

or els he would not be so readie to doe them seruice .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.189

But if you mean , that such as seek remedie against them , & wold haue
them rooted out , be so seduced and mis-led by the deuill , as you
speake , I say your speach is rash and foolish ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.190

for they that be earnest against witches , be earnest against the deuil
, GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.191

they defie the deuil , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.192

they seek to resist him , and to roote out his instruments .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.193

Now , if you were a man that had any learning , you should see , that
contraries can@ @not be in the same subiect , at one instant , in the
same part , and in the same respect : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.194

how then can a man hate the deuill , defie the deuill and his workes ,
and yet follow him at one time ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.195

<font> Dan. <$$font> I know that witches and coniurers are seduced and
become the vassals of Satan : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.196

they be his seruants , and not he theirs , as you speake .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.197

But I mean indeed that multitudes are seduced and led from God , to
follow the deuil , by means of witches & coniurers :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.198

yea , I speak it of those , not which are carfed of a godlie zeale , but
of a blinde rage and mad furie against them . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.199

If I speake this rashlie and foolishlie , as you say , and your self
learned as you boast , and I vnlearned , I shall be the more easilie
ouerthrowne . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.200

But I speake so truly , and can so well iustifie all that I haue said by
the word of God , that your learning and best skill , shall not be able
to disprooue the same . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.201

Your logicke at the first doth faile you . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.202

Not that contraries can be in the same subiect at the same instant , in
the same part , and in the same respect . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3R.203

But herein you are vtterly blinde and deceiued , that you name
contraries , and take it that the first of <P_B3V> them , as namelie ,
to hate the deuill , to defie him and his workes , are in them , when as
indeed they are in them but in imagination . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.204

For if men say and think they defie the deuill and his workes , and
through blindnes and infidelitie , are euen bewitched , and seduced to
followe the deuill , and to do his will , doth their speach and blinde
imagination make the things indeed to be in them ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.205

What if a poore begger woman say and thinke that she is a Queene :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.206

is she therfore no begger , begging still her bread ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.207

or is she rid of her lice ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.208

<font> M. B. <$$font> Nay , if you iudge , I haue done .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.209

If men be earnest against the deuill , and defie him and all his workes
, are you to iudge of their conscience , and to say they defie him but
in imagination , and follow him , and worship him in deede ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.210

is not God alone the iudge ouer mens hearts ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.211

Againe , do you compare those that are in their right mind , with such
as be mad , or out of their wits ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.212

<font> Dan. <$$font> I knowe that God alone is the searcher of the
heart , touching the thinges which lie hid in secrete :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.213

But where things are open and manifest , the tree is known by the fruits
, so far as we may goe . As if a man professe the faith of Iesus Christ
soundlie , in all pointes according to the word of God , and doth frame
his life thereafter in doing good workes : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.214

it is verie wicked for anie man to iudge of him , that he is an
hypocrite , and that he doth all of vaine glorie .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.215

And yet it may be that the Lord , who discerneth the secrete intents of
the heart , seeth indeed that he is but an hypocrite .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.216

On the contrarie parte , where a man professeth in wordes that he doeth
defie the deuill and all his workes , and yet when it commeth to the
triall of Gods word , hee is found to be seduced , and wrapped in blinde
errours of the deuill , in infidelitie , and euill works , in which he
fulfilleth the will of Satan , and honoureth him in the place of God :
Shal we say that this is a good man because of his words and imagination
, that he defieth the deuill and his works ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B3V.217

<P_B4R>

<font> Wo be to them that cal good euil , and euil good . Esa. 5 .
<$$font> GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.219

We may say they are in bad case , except they repent , and turne from
following Satan . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.220

But yet I say , that a faithful man may erre in some of these thinges
through weaknesse of faith , and through ignorance .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.221

And therefore , here men may not be too rash in iudgment .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.222

And now wheras you find fault , that I make comparison between such as
be mad and those that be in their right mind it is your ignora~ce ,
which do not consider that ther be two kinds of madnes , or being out of
their right mind , the one for matters of this worlde , the other for
thinges spirituall and heauenlie . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.223

There bee which are in their wittes for this worlde , which touching
spirituall things are as farre awrie in their imaginations , as the
poore beggar , which thinketh she is a goodlie queene .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.224

Doth not the holie Apostle say , that <font> because men receiue not the
loue of the truth , God wil send them strong delusion to beleeue lies .
2. Thess. 2 <$$font> . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.225

And what is that , but that Satan shall seduce , illude and bewitch
their minds , to make them beleeue that they worshippe and follow God ,
when they worship and follow him ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.226

<font> M. B. <$$font> {HELSINKI:"B,"} Doe you take that to be S.
Paules meaning ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.227

Doth Satan bewitch mens mindes , and leade them into falsehoode and
errour , making them beleeue they worshipp God , when they worship
deuils ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.228

<font> Dan. <$$font> S. Paul speaketh there indeed of the comming of
the great Antichrist in the power of the Deuill .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.229

Nowe , those which are seduced and worship Antichrist , think they
worship God : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.230

but marke what S. Iohn sayth , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.231

<font> All the world wondred , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.232

and followed the beast , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.233

and worshipped the dragon which gaue power to the beast :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.234

& they worshipped the beast . Reuelat. 13 <$$font> .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.235

And looke in the 12. chapter of the Reuelation , and you shall find
that the Dragon , which the Popery doth worship in stead of God , is the
Deuill . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.236

<font> M. B. <$$font> Trulie I like your wordes well ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4R.237

I am persuaded <P_B4V> the deuill doth seduce and bewitch mens mindes :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.238

But touching these that seek help at the hands of cunning men and women
against witches , I can@ @not thinke so hardlie of them .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.239

I may be awry , I see well : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.240

I will not be obstinate , if the word of God shew me mine errour .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.241

Let vs euen friendly conferre of the matter . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.242

Be not offended with me , and for my part , I will speake all that I
knowe or thinke . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.243

<font> Dan. <$$font> I must intreate you likewise to beare with my
plaine speaches . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.244

And let vs in the matters proceede from one point to another , standing
onlie vpon that , wherein we shall be found to differ in iudgment .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.245

And let Gods word be the Iudge betweene vs . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.246

<font> Sam. <$$font> I like this wel , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.247

though I can say but litle , I wil sit and heare you .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.248

<font> Dan. <$$font> What is the first question that we shal handle ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.249

<font> M. B. <$$font> I heard you say , if I did not mistake your
speach that there be witches that worke by the deuill .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.250

But yet I pray you tell me , doe you think there be such ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.251

I know some are of opinion there be none . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.252

<font> Dan. <$$font> It is so euident by the Scriptures , and in all
experience , that there be witches which worke by the deuill , or rather
I may say , the deuill worketh by them , that such as go about to prooue
the contrarie , doe shewe themselues but cauillers .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.253

<font> M. B. <$$font> I am glad we agree in that point ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.254

I hope we shall in the rest . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.255

What say you to this ? that the witches haue their spirits ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.256

some hath one , some hath more , as two , three , foure , or fiue , some
in one likenesse , and some in another , as like cattes , weasils ,
toads , or mise , whome they nourish with milke , or with a chicken , or
by letting them sucke now and then a drop of blood : whome they call
when they be offended with anie , and lend them to hurt them in their
bodies ; yea , to kill them , and to kill their cattell ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.257

<font> Dan. <$$font> Here is great deceit , and great illusion ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,B4V.258

here the deuil leadeth the ignorant people into foule errours , <P_C1R>
by which hee draweth them hedlong into manie grieuous sinnes .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,C1R.259

<P_D4V>

<font> Sam. <$$font> Indeed it is my desire that you woulde speake a
litle playner of these poyntes : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.261

for I haue marked well all your talke , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.262

and can@ @not well conceiue of the last things you dealt in .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.263

With your leaue M. <font> B. <$$font> I would aske two or three
questions of my friend . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.264

Here was but seuen miles hence at <font> W. H. <$$font> one
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.265

N. the man was of good wealth , and well accounted of among his
neighbours . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.266

He pined away with sicknes halfe a yeare , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.267

and at last died . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.268

After hee was dead , his wife suspected ill dealing :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.269

she went to a cunning man , I know not where , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.270

and desired to know whereof her husband died .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.271

He told her that her husband died of witcherie :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.272

he asked her if she did not suspect any therabout .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.273

She sayd there was one woman which she did not like , one mother <font>
W. <$$font> GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.274

her husband and she fell out , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.275

and he fell sick within two dayes after , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.276

and neuer recouered again . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,D4V.277

He shewed <P_E1R> her the woman as plaine in a glasse , as we see one
another , and in the very apparell she went in at that hower ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.278

for shee ware an old red cappe with corners , such as women were wont to
weare ; GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.279

and in that she appeared in the glasse : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.280

Hee taught her how she might bring her to confesse .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.281

Well , she followed his counsell , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.282

went home , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.283

caused her to be apprehended and caried before a Iustice of peace .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.284

He examined her so wisely , that in the end she confessed shee killed
the man . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.285

She was sent to prison , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.286

she was arraigned , condemned , and executed : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.287

And vpon the ladder shee seemed very penetent , desiring all the world
to forgiue her . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.288

She said she had a spirit in the likenes of a yellow dun catte .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.289

This catte came vnto her , as she said , as she sat by her fire , when
she was fallen out with a neighbour of hers , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.290

and wished that the vengeance of God might light vpon him and his .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.291

The catte bad her not be affraid , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.292

she wold do her no harme : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.293

She had serued a dame fiue yeares in Kent , that was now dead ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.294

and if she would , she would be her seruant . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.295

And wheras , said the Cat , such a man hath misused thee , if thou wilt
I will plague him in his cattell . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.296

She sent the Cat , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.297

she killed three hogs and one Cow . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.298

The man suspecting , burnt a pig aliue , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.299

and as she said , her cat wold neuer go thither any more .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.300

Afterward she fel out with that N. GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.301

She sent her Cat , who told her , that she had giuen him that , which
hee should neuer recouer : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.302

and indeed the man died . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.303

Now doe you not thinke the woman spake the trueth in all this ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.304

Would the woman accuse her selfe falsely at her death ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.305

Did not the Cat become her seruant ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.306

Did not she send her ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.307

Did shee not plague and kill both man and beaste ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.308

What shoulde a man thinke of this ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.309

<font> Dan. <$$font> You propounde a particular example ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.310

and let vs examine euerything in it touching the witch ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.311

for the womans fact that went to the wise man , wee are not yet come to
that point . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.312

You say the Cat came to her when she was in a great rage with one of her
neighbours , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1R.313

and did <P_E1V> curse , wishing the vengeance of God to fall vpon him
and his . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.314

<font> Sam. <$$font> She said so indeede . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.315

I heard her with mine own ears , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.316

for I was at the execution . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.317

<font> Dan. <$$font> Then tel me who set her in such a deuilish rage ,
so to curse & banne , as to wish {HELSINKI:with} that the
{HELSINKI:missing_"the"} vengeance of God might light vpon him and his ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.318

did not the Cat ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.319

<font> Sam. <$$font> Trulie I thinke the Deuil wrought that in her .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.320

<font> Dan. <$$font> Uerie well , then you see the Cat is the beginner
of this play . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.321

<font> Sam. <$$font> Cald you it a play ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.322

It was no play to some . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.323

<font> Dan. <$$font> Indeed the witch at last had better haue wrought
hard , than bene at her play . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.324

But I meane Satan did play the Iugler : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.325

For , doth he not offer his seruice ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.326

Doth he not moue her to send him to plague the man ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.327

Tell me , is she so forward to send , as he is to be sent ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.328

Or doe you not take it , that he ruleth in her heart , and euen wholly
directeth it to this matter ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.329

<font> Sam. <$$font> I am fully perswaded he ruleth her heart .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.330

<font> Dan. <$$font> Then was shee his drudge , and not he her servant
, GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.331

he needeth not to be hired nor intreated , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.332

for if her hart were to send him any where , vnto such as he knoweth hee
can@ @not hurt , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.333

nor seeth how to make any shewe that he hurteth them ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.334

he can quickly turne her from that . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.335

Wel , the cat goeth GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.336

and killeth the man , certain hogs and a Cow ; GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.337

howe could she tell that the Cat did it ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.338

<font> Sam. <$$font> How could she tell ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.339

why he told her man , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.340

and she saw and heard that he lost his cattell .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.341

<font> Dan. <$$font> The Cat would lie , would she not ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.342

for they say such cattes are lyers . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.343

<font> Sam. <$$font> I doe not trust the Cats wordes ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.344

but because the thing fell out so . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.345

<font> Dan. <$$font> Because the hogges and the Cow died , are you sure
the Cat did kil them , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E1V.346

might they not die of some naturall causes as you see both men and
beasts are well , and die <P_E2R> suddainlie ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.347

<font> Sam. <$$font> That were strange , if they should die of naturall
causes , and fall out so fit at the time after he was sent ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.348

<font> Dan. <$$font> It is not straunge at all , as marke what I tell
you and you shall easily see . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.349

There bee naturall causes of tortures and griefe , of lamenes , and of
death in the bodies of men and beastes , which lie so hid and secrete ,
that the learneddest Physitians can not espie them ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.350

but the deuill seeth them , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.351

and can coniecture very neere the time , when they will take effect .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.352

Then doeth hee ply it , to bring the matter about that it may seeme he
did it . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.353

If hee haue any witch to deale by , he stirreth vp some occasion to set
her in a rage with that partie : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.354

and then he will be sent , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.355

and telleth her he doeth it . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.356

If he haue no witch to deale by , yet hee will set debate betweene the
partie and some other , whom he may bring into suspition , as his
greatest desire is to haue innocent bloud shed .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.357

<font> Sam. <$$font> Here is a matter brought about indeed ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.358

how could the Cat doe all this ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.359

<font> Dan. <$$font> I told you before , that the deuilles worke
together , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.360

and can speedilie and most craftilie compasse thinges , which are farre
beyond the reach of mans capacitie . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.361

But sometime the deuill hath power giuen him to plague
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.362

and doth the harme . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.363

Admit he had power giuen him , and did kill the cattell of this man :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.364

let vs come nowe to that , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.365

who think you , gaue him the power for to strike and kill ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.366

Did the witch giue him the power , or the Lord God ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.367

<font> Sam. <$$font> Nay surely , the witch can@ @not giue him power .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.368

<font> Dan. <$$font> Did he receiue power after she sent him ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.369

<font> Sam. <$$font> That can@ @not I tell . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.370

<font> Dan. <$$font> The~ mark a litle : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.371

he hath power giue~ him to plague this man in his goods :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.372

he wil do it , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.373

but he will doe it craftily . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.374

The Lord gaue him power ouer the goods of holie Iob :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.375

he worketh by instruments , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.376

for he stirreth vp the Sabeis , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.377

and they take away his Oxen , and his Asses : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2R.378

he raiseth vp <P_E2V> also the Chaldeis , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.379

and they cary away his Camels , <font> Iob. 1 <$$font> .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.380

Euen so , hauing power to strike , he wil be sent by a witch ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.381

he could doo it without her , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.382

but he gayneth much that way , as we shall see when wee come to speake
of the remedyes which men seeke . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.383

<font> Sam. <$$font> I wonder then that the man neuer had more hurt
after he had burnt his pig aliue : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.384

<font> Dan. <$$font> O man , the Deuill can abide no roast meate , nor
no fire , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.385

he is affraide , if they fall a roasting , that they will roast him .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.386

If they run at him with a spit red_hot , they gaster him so sore , that
his dame shal go her self , if she will GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.387

he will come no more there . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.388

But of these thinges we are to speake afterward in their place .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.389

<font> Sam. <$$font> You make the deuill wonderfull subtill .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.390

<font> Dan. <$$font> He is so subtill and full of all craft and fleight
, that no earthly creature can escape from being seduced by him ,
without the light of Gods heauenly word . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.391

But let vs come now to the other man , whom the witch confessed shee
killed by her Cat . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.392

<font> Sam. <$$font> Yea , that me thinketh is more than the other ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.393

the woman was told by the cunning man that her husband was killed by
witcherie . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.394

The witch confessed so much at her death . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.395

The Cat told the witch , that she killed him .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.396

<font> Dan. <$$font> Here be a companie of credible persons to be
beleeued : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.397

the cunning man saith the man was bewitched to death .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.398

Who told him that ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.399

<font> Sam. <$$font> His spirite that maketh the witch appeare in the
glasse . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.400

<font> Dan. <$$font> That same Spirite , what doe you take him to be ,
an Angell , or a Deuill ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.401

<font> Sam. <$$font> Some of the cunning men say , they haue Moses or
Elias , or the Spirite of some holy man . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.402

<font> Dan. <$$font> The Deuill can turne himselfe into the likenes of
an Angell of light . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E2V.403

For they that doe thinke the cunning men and women deale with any other
Spirite than Satan , <P_E3R> haue no vnderstanding .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.404

Satan saith , the man was witched to death . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.405

<font> Sam. <$$font> Satan saith so , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.406

he is not to bee beleeued , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.407

but the witch confesseth it was so . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.408

<font> Dan . <$$font> Who told the witch ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.409

<font> Sam. <$$font> Her Cat that she sent . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.410

<font> Dan. <$$font> What is the Cat , a deuill ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.411

then remember the prouerbe , aske his fellow if he be a theefe .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.412

All the matter resteth vpon the testimony of deuils ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.413

and they not put to their oath . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.414

Wee will not ground vpon mans testimonie without an oath ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.415

and must we beleeue the bare worde of deuils ?
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.416

<font> Sam. <$$font> Do you thinke then that the man was not killed by
witcherie ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.417

<font> Dan. <$$font> It may be the Lord had giuen Satan power to plague
the man in his bodie , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.418

and then he vnder a colour would be sent by a witch .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.419

But it is most like that his bodie did languish and pine of naturall
causes , which the deuill did know , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.420

and so would be sent , and seeme to do all , when as indeed he had no
power to touch him . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.421

For , although the Lord giue the deuill power , to strike some in their
bodies for their haynous sinnes , yet the most which the witches thinke
their spirits doe kill at their request , doe die of naturall diseases .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.422

<font> Sam. <$$font> Then it seemeth the witches are deceiued , and
mocked , when he maketh them beleeue he doeth kill and plague when hee
doeth not . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.423

And againe in this , where he hath power giuen him of God , to strike
man or beast , hee could doe it , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.424

and would without the witch , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.425

and so vseth the witch for a collour to draw on worse matters .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.426

<font> Dan. <$$font> I am glad you take my meaning so right :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.427

for , thinke deeply of the matters , and you shall see it must needs be
so . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.428

<font> Sam. <$$font> I interrupted GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.429

<font> M. B. <$$font> I pray you goe forward now to the rest .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3R.430

<P_E3V>

<font> Dan. <$$font> Our matter which we come vnto nowe , is the helpe
and remedie that is fought for against witches at the hands of cunning
men . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.432

And now if it please you to propound your questions , I will answere to
them the best I can . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.433

M. <font> B. <$$font> Nay truly , I see already all is naught ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.434

but yet I will obiect those things which haue caried me awrie .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.435

I take it a man is to seek remedy against euils ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.436

& I thought it was euen a gift that God gaue vnto those whom we cal
cunning men , that they did very much good by .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.437

When a thing is lost , when a thing is stollen , many goe to them ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.438

and they help them to it . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.439

I did know where the Communion cup was stollen :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.440

the Churchwardens rode to a wise man , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.441

he gaue them direction what night , and where they should stand ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.442

and the party that had stollen it should come thither , and confesse he
had it : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.443

and certainly they had it againe . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.444

I did know one that had a child of fiue yeares old , a gyrle ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.445

it was taken piteouslie : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.446

the father was in great heauinesse , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.447

and knew not what to doe : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.448

some gaue him counsell to goe to a woman which dwelt ten miles from him
, and to carie some of the clothes which the child lay in :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.449

he did so , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.450

the woman told him that his child was bewitched ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.451

and if hee did not seeke remedie in time , the childe would be lost :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.452

Shee bad him take some olde clothes , and let the child lie in them all
night , and then take and burne them : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.453

and he should see by the burning , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.454

for if they did burne black , that shewed the child was bewitched ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.455

and she said further , that doubtlesse the witch would come thither :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.456

he followed her aduice , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.457

and sure as we be here , there came an old woman in , which he suspected
, euen while they were burning , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.458

and made an errand : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.459

the man made no more adoe , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.460

but euen laid his clowthes vpon her GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.461

and clawed her vntill the blood ranne down her cheeks ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.462

and the child was well within two dayes after .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.463

I could tell you of a stranger thing , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.464

but I haue it but by report , but yet indeed by very credible report .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E3V.465

There was <P_E4R> a butcher by his trade that had a boy to his sonne ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.466

his name was Iohn , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.467

grieuous sores did breake forth vpon him : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.468

they laid salues , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.469

and none woulde cleaue for to draw or to ease them .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.470

The father making his moane to a friend of his , he told him whether he
should goe to a verie skilfull man : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.471

he did goe , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.472

and being demanded whom he suspected , she was shewed him in a glasse ,
an old woman that dwelt not farre from him in an house alone :
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.473

he told the cunning man , that the woman had shut vp her dore , & was
gone from home out of the shyre , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.474

and so he could not tell how to come by her . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.475

he told him a way how he should fetch her home .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.476

Cut off the hair <paren> said he <$$paren> of the boyes head , and put
it in a cloath and burne it , and I warrant you she wil come home with
al the speed she can . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.477

Burne it abroade , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.478

burne it not in a chimney , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.479

for if you doe , it will make you all affraide .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.480

The man went home GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.481

and did this . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.482

The woman came home with all speede , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.483

came to his house , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.484

came to the boy , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.485

and saide , Iohn , scratch me , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.486

hee scratched her vntil the blood followed , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.487

and whereas before nothing would draw his soares , they healed of
themselues . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.488

What should a man thinke of such things ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.489

<font> Dan. <$$font> You tell of some , which haue receiued help from
the hands of cunning men : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.490

And no doubt there may infinit examples be brought .
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.491

Some haue lost , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.492

some haue thinges stollen from them , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.493

some are vexed in their bodies : GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.494

They come by the things againe which were lost or stollen ,
GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.495

they are taught to doe certain things , GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.496

and are eased from their helpe , if it deserue the name to be called
help , from the deuill . GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.497

And do you thinke a man may lawfullie seek helpe at the hands of the
deuill ? GIFFORD-1593-E2-H,E4R.498

M. <font> B. <$$font> Some are perswaded that they doe not seeke helpe
at the hand of deuils , when they goe to the wise men : but that it is a
gift which God hath giuen them , euen to do good withall .
