CHAP. II . WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.4

OBSERVATIONS OF THE OTTER AND CHUB . WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.5

<$$heading>

<font> Venat. <$$font> My friend <font> Piscator <$$font> , you have
kept time with my thoughts , WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.7

for the Sun is just rising , WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.8

and I my self just now come to this place , WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.9

and the dogs have just now put down an <font> Otter <$$font> ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.10

look down at the bottom of the hill there in that Meadow , chequered
with <font> water-Lillies <$$font> , and <font> Lady-smocks <$$font> ,
there you may see what work they make ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.11

look , look , you may see all busie , men and dogs , dogs and men , all
busie . WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.12

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Sir , I am right glad to meet you , and glad to
have so fair an entrance into this dayes sport , and glad to see so many
dogs , and more men all in pursuit of the <font> Otter <$$font> ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.13

let@ @'s complement no longer , but joyn unto them ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.14

come honest <font> Venator <$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.15

let@ @'s be gone , WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.16

let us make hast ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.17

I long to be doing : WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.18

no reasonable hedg or ditch shall hold me . WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.19

<font> Ven. <$$font> Gentleman Huntsman , where found you this <font>
Otter <$$font> ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.20

<font> Hunt. <$$font> Marry <paren> Sir <$$paren> we found her a mile
from this place a fishing ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.21

she has this morning eaten the greatest part of this <font> Trout
<$$font> ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.22

she has only left thus much of it as you see , WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.23

and was fishing for more ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.24

when we came we found her just at it : WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.25

but we were here very early , WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.26

we were here an hour before Sun-rise , WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.27

and have given her no rest since we came ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.28

sure she will hardly escape all these dogs and men .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.29

I am to have the skin if we kill her . WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.30

<font> Ven. <$$font> Why , Sir , what@ @'s the skin worth ?
WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.31

<font> Hunt. <$$font> 'T@ @is worth ten shillings to make gloves ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.32

the gloves of an <font> Otter <$$font> are the best fortification for
your hands that can be thought on against wet weather .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.33

<font> Pisc. <$$font> I pray , honest Huntsman , let me ask you a
pleasant question , WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.34

do you hunt a beast or a fish ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,210.35

<P_211>

<font> Hunt. <$$font> Sir , It is not in my power to resolve you ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.37

I leave it to be resolved by the Colledge of <font> Carthusians <$$font>
, who have made vows never to eat flesh . WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.38

But I have heard , the question hath been debated among many great
Clerks , WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.39

and they seem to differ about it ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.40

yet most agree that her tail is Fish : WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.41

and if her body be Fish too , then I may say , that a Fish will walk
upon land , <paren> for an <font> Otter <$$font> does so <$$paren>
sometimes five or six , or ten miles in a night to catch for her young
ones , or to glut herself with Fish , WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.42

and I can tell you that <font> Pigeons <$$font> will fly forty miles for
a breakfast , WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.43

but <font> Sir <$$font> , I am sure the <font> Otter <$$font> devours
much Fish , WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.44

and kills and spoils much more than he eats : WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.45

And I can tell you , that this Dog-fisher <paren> for so the Latins call
him <$$paren> can smell a Fish in the water an_hundred yards from him
<paren> <font> Gesner <$$font> says much farther <$$paren> and that his
stones are good against the Falling-sickness : and that there is an herb
<font> Benione <$$font> , which being hung in a linnen cloth near a
Fish-pond , or any haunt that he uses , makes him to avoid the place ;
which proves he can smell both by water and land ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.46

and I can tell you there is brave hunting this Waterdog in <font>
Corn-wall <$$font> , where there have been so many , that our learned
<font> Cambden <$$font> says , there is a River called <font> Ottersey
<$$font> , which was so named , by reason of the abundance of <font>
Otters <$$font> that bred and fed in it . WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.47

And thus much for my knowledg of the <font> Otter <$$font> , which you
may now see above water at vent , and the dogs close with him ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.48

I now see he will not last long , WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.49

follow therefore my Masters , WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.50

follow , WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.51

for <font> Sweetlips <$$font> was like to have him at this last vent .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.52

<font> Ven. <$$font> Oh me , all the Horse are got over the River ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.53

what shall we do now ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.54

shall we follow them over the water ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.55

<font> Hunt. <$$font> No , <font> Sir <$$font> , no , be not so eager ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.56

stay a little WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.57

and follow me , WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.58

for both they , and the dogs will be suddenly on this side again , I
warrant you : and the <font> Otter <$$font> too , it may be :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.59

now have at him with <font> Kilbuck <$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.60

for he vents again . WALTON-1676-E3-H,211.61

<P_212>

<font> Ven. <$$font> Marry so he do's , WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.63

for look he vents in that corner . WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.64

Now , now <font> Ringwood <$$font> has him : WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.65

now he@ @'s gone again , WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.66

and has bit the poor dog . WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.67

Now <font> Sweetlips <$$font> has him ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.68

hold him <font> Sweetlips <$$font> ! WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.69

now all the dogs have him , some above and some under water ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.70

but now , now he@ @'s tir'd , and past losing : WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.71

come bring him to me , <font> Sweetlips <$$font> .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.72

Look , 't@ @is a <font> Bitch-Otter <$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.73

and she has lately whelp'd , WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.74

let@ @'s go to the place where she was <font> put down <$$font> ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.75

and not far from it you will find all her young ones , I dare warrant
you , and kill them all too . WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.76

<font> Hunt. <$$font> Come , Gentlemen , WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.77

come all , WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.78

let@ @'s go to the place where we <font> put down <$$font> the <font>
Otter <$$font> . WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.79

Look you , WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.80

hereabout it was that she kennel'd ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.81

look you , here it was indeed , WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.82

for here@ @'s her young ones , no less than five ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.83

come let@ @'s kill them all . WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.84

<font> Pisc. <$$font> No , I pray Sir , save me one , and I@ @'ll try
if I can make her tame , as I know an ingenious Gentleman in <font>
Leicester-shire <$$font> <paren> Mr. <font> Nich. Seagrave <$$font>
<$$paren> has done ; who hath not only made her tame , but to catch Fish
, and do many other things of much pleasure . WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.85

<font> Hunt. <$$font> Take one with all my heart ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.86

but let us kill the rest . WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.87

And now let@ @'s go to an honest Ale-house , where we may have a cup of
good <font> Barley-wine <$$font> , and sing <font> Old Rose <$$font> ,
and all of us rejoyce together . WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.88

<font> Venat. <$$font> Come my friend , <font> Piscator <$$font> ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.89

let me invite you along with us ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.90

I@ @'ll bear you charges this night , WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.91

and you shall bear mine to_morrow ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.92

for my intention is to accompany you a day or two in Fishing .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.93

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Sir , your request is granted ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.94

and I shall be right glad , both to exchange such a courtesie , and also
to enjoy your company . WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.95

<font> Venat. <$$font> Well , now let@ @'s go to your sport of Angling
. WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.96

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Let@ @'s be going with all my heart .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.97

God keep you all , Gentlemen , WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.98

and send you meet this day with another Bitch-Otter , and kill her
merrily , and all her young ones too . WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.99

<font> Ven. <$$font> Now , <font> Piscator <$$font> , where will you
begin to fish ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,212.100

<P_213>

<font> Pisc. <$$font> We are not yet come to a likely place ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.102

I must walk a mile further yet , before I begin .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.103

<font> Venat. <$$font> Well then , I pray , as we walk tell me freely ,
how do you like your lodging and mine Hoste and the company ?
WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.104

is not mine Hoste a witty man ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.105

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Sir , I will tell you presently what I think of
your Hoste ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.106

but first I will tell you , I am glad these <font> Otters <$$font> were
killed , WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.107

and I am sorry there are no more <font> Otter-killers <$$font> :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.108

for I know that the want of <font> Otter-killers <$$font> , and the not
keeping the <font> Fence months <$$font> for the preservation of <font>
fish <$$font> , will in time prove the destruction of all <font> Rivers
<$$font> ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.109

and those very few that are left , that make conscience of the Laws of
the Nation , and of keeping days of abstinence , will be forced to eat
flesh , or suffer more inconveniences than are yet foreseen .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.110

<font> Venat. <$$font> Why , Sir , what be those you call the Fence
months ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.111

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Sir , they be principally three , namely , <font>
March , April <$$font> , and <font> May <$$font> ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.112

for these be the usual months that <font> Salmon <$$font> come out of
the Sea to spawn in most fresh Rivers , and their Fry would about a
certain time return back to the salt water , if they were not hindred by
<font> weres <$$font> and <font> unlawful gins <$$font> , which the
greedy Fisher-men set , and so destroy them by thousands , as they would
<paren> being so taught by nature <$$paren> change the <font> fresh
<$$font> for <font> salt water <$$font> . WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.113

He that shall view the wise Statutes made in the 13 of <font> Edw. the
I. <$$font> and the like in <font> Rich. the III. <$$font> may see
several provisions made against the destruction of Fish :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.114

and though I profess no knowledg of the Law , yet I am sure the
regulation of these defects might be easily mended .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.115

But I remember that a wise friend of mine did usually say , <font> That
which is every bodies business , is no bodies business <$$font> .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.116

If it were otherwise , there could not be so many Nets and Fish that are
under the Statute size , sold daily amongst us , and of which the <font>
conservators <$$font> of the waters should be ashamed .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.117

But above all , the taking Fish in Spawning time , may be said to be
against nature ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,213.118

it is like the taking the dam on the nest <P_214> when she hatches her
young : a sin so against nature , that Almighty God hath in the
Levitical Law made a Law against it . WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.119

But the poor Fish have enemies enough beside such unnatural <font>
Fisher-men <$$font> , as namely , the <font> Otters <$$font> that I
spake of , the <font> Cormorant <$$font> , the <font> Bittern <$$font> ,
the <font> Osprey <$$font> , the <font> Sea-gull <$$font> , the <font>
Hern <$$font> , the <font> Kingfisher <$$font> , the <font> Gorrara
<$$font> , the <font> Puet <$$font> , the <font> Swan , Goose , Ducks
<$$font> , and the <font> Craber <$$font> , which some call the
Water-rat : against all which any honest man may make a just quarrel ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.120

but I will not , WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.121

I will leave them to be quarreled with , and kill'd by others ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.122

for I am not of a cruel nature , WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.123

I love to kill nothing but Fish . WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.124

And now to your question concerning your Hoste , to speak truly , he is
not to me a good companion : WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.125

for most of his conceits were either Scripture jests , or lascivious
jests ; for which I count no man witty , WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.126

for the Devil will help a man that way inclined , to the first ; and his
own corrupt nature <paren> which he always carries with him <$$paren> to
the latter . WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.127

But a companion that feasts the company with <font> wit <$$font> and
<font> mirth <$$font> , and leaves out the sin <paren> which is usually
mixt with them <$$paren> he is the man ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.128

and indeed such a companion should have his charges born :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.129

and to such company I hope to bring you this night ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.130

for at <font> Trout-hall <$$font> , not far from this place , where I
purpose to lodge to_night , there is usually an Angler that proves good
company : WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.131

and let me tell you , good company and good discourse are the very
sinews of vertue : WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.132

but for such discourse as we heard last night , it infects others ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.133

the very boys will learn to talk and swear as they heard mine Host , and
another of the company that shall be nameless ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.134

I am sorry the other is a Gentleman , WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.135

for less Religion will not save their Souls than a beggars ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.136

I think more will be required at the last great day .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.137

Well , you know what Example is able to do , WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.138

and I know what the Poet says in the like case , which is worthy to be
noted by all parents and people of civility : WALTON-1676-E3-H,214.139

{COM:verse_omitted}

<P_215>

{COM:verse_omitted}

This is reason put into Verse , and worthy the consideration of a wise
man . WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.143

But of this no more , WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.144

for though I love civility , yet I hate severe censures :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.145

I@ @'le to my own art , WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.146

and I doubt not but at yonder tree I shall catch a <font> Chub <$$font>
, WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.147

and then we@ @'l turn to an honest cleanly Hostess , that I know right
well ; rest our selves there , and dress it for our dinner .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.148

<font> Venat. <$$font> Oh Sir , a <font> Chub <$$font> is the worst
Fish that swims , WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.149

I hoped for a <font> Trout <$$font> to my dinner .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.150

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Trust me , <font> Sir <$$font> , there is not a
likely place for a <font> Trout <$$font> hereabout ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.151

and we staid so long to take our leave of your Huntsmen this morning ,
that the Sun is got so high , and shines so clear , that I will not
undertake the catching of a <font> Trout <$$font> till evening ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.152

and though a <font> Chub <$$font> be by you and many others reckoned the
worst of <font> fish <$$font> , yet you shall see I@ @'ll make it a good
Fish , by dressing it . WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.153

<font> Ven. <$$font> Why , how will you dress him ?
WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.154

<font> Pisc. <$$font> I@ @'ll tell you by and by , when I have caught
him . WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.155

Look you here , Sir , WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.156

do you see ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.157

<paren> but you must stand very close <$$paren> WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.158

there lye upon the top of the water in this very hole twenty <font>
Chubs <$$font> : WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.159

I@ @'ll catch only one , WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.160

and that shall be the biggest of them all : WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.161

and that I will do so , I@ @'ll hold you twenty to one ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.162

and you shall see it done . WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.163

<font> Venat. <$$font> I marry Sir , now you talk like an Artist ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.164

and I@ @'ll say you are one , when I shall see you perform what you say
you can do ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.165

but I yet doubt it . WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.166

<font> Pisc. <$$font> You shall not doubt it long ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.167

for you shall see me do it presently : WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.168

look , WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.169

the biggest of these <font> Chubs <$$font> has had some bruise upon his
tail , by a Pike or some other accident , WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.170

and that looks like a white spot ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.171

that very <font> Chub <$$font> I mean to put into your hands presently ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.172

sit you but down in the shade , and stay but a little while , and I@
@'le warrant you I@ @'le bring him to you . WALTON-1676-E3-H,215.173

<P_216>

<font> Venat. <$$font> I@ @'le sit down WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.175

and hope well , because you seem to be so confident .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.176

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Look you Sir , WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.177

there is a tryal of my skill , WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.178

there he is , that very <font> Chub <$$font> that I shewed you with the
white spot on his tail : WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.179

and I@ @'le be as certain to make him a good dish of meat , as I was to
catch him . WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.180

I@ @'le now lead you to an honest Ale-house where we shall find a
cleanly room , <font> Lavender <$$font> in the Windows , and twenty
<font> Ballads <$$font> stuck about the wall ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.181

there my Hostess <paren> which I may tell you , is both cleanly and
handsome and civil <$$paren> hath drest many a one for me ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.182

and shall now dress it after my fashion , WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.183

and I warrant it good meat . WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.184

<font> Ven. <$$font> Come Sir , with all my heart ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.185

for I begin to be hungry , WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.186

and long to be at it , and indeed to rest my self too ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.187

for though I have walk'd but four miles this morning , yet I begin to be
weary ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.188

yesterdays hunting hangs still upon me . WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.189

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Well Sir , and you shall quickly be at rest ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.190

for yonder is the house I mean to bring you to .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.191

Come Hostess , WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.192

how do you ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.193

Will you first give us a cup of your best drink , and then dress this
<font> Chub <$$font> , as you drest my last , when I and my friend were
here about eight or ten days ago ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.194

but you must do me one courtesie , WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.195

it must be done instantly . WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.196

<font> Host. <$$font> I will do it , Mr. <font> Piscator <$$font> ,
and with all the speed I can . WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.197

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Now Sir , has not my Hostess made hast ?
WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.198

and does not the fish look lovely ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.199

<font> Ven. <$$font> Both , upon my word , Sir ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.200

and therefore let@ @'s say grace and fall to eating of it .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.201

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Well Sir , how do you like it ?
WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.202

<font> Ven. <$$font> Trust me , 't@ @is as good meat as I ever tasted :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.203

now let me thank you for it , drink to you , and beg a courtesie of you
; WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.204

but it must not be deny'd me . WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.205

<font> Pisc. <$$font> What is it I pray Sir ? WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.206

you are so modest , that me@ @thinks I may promise to grant it before it
is asked . WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.207

<font> Ven. <$$font> Why Sir , it is , that from henceforth you would
allow me to call you <font> Master <$$font> , and that really I may be
your Scholar . WALTON-1676-E3-H,216.208

for you are such a companion , and have so quickly caught , and <P_217>
so excellently cook'd this fish , as makes me ambitious to be your
Scholar . WALTON-1676-E3-H,217.209

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Give me your hand ; from this time forward I will
be your Master , and teach you as much of this Art as I am able ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,217.210

and will , as you desire me , tell you somewhat of the nature of most of
the Fish that we are to angle for ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,217.211

and I am sure I both can and will tell you more than any common <font>
Angler <$$font> yet knows . WALTON-1676-E3-H,217.212

CHAP. IX . WALTON-1676-E3-H,292.215

OBSERVATIONS OF THE CARP , WITH DIRECTIONS HOW TO FISH FOR HIM .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,292.216

<$$heading>

<font> Pisc. <$$font> The <font> Carp <$$font> is the Queen of Rivers :
a stately , a good , and a very subtil fish , that was not at first bred
, nor hath been long in <font> England <$$font> , but is now naturalized
. WALTON-1676-E3-H,292.218

It is said , they were brought hither by one Mr. <font> Mascal <$$font>
a Gentleman , that then lived at <font> Plumsted <$$font> in <font>
Sussex <$$font> , a County that abounds more with this fish than any in
this Nation . WALTON-1676-E3-H,292.219

You may remember that I told you , <font> Gesner <$$font> says , there
are no <font> Pikes <$$font> in <font> Spain <$$font> ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,292.220

and doubtless , there was a time , about a_hundred or a few more years
ago , when there were no <font> Carps <$$font> in <font> England
<$$font> , as may seem to be affirmed by S. <font> Richard Baker
<$$font> , in whose Chronicle you may find these Verses .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,292.221

<font> Hops and Turkies , Carps and Beer Came into <$$font> England
<font> all in a year . <$$font> WALTON-1676-E3-H,292.222

And doubtless as of Sea-fish the <font> Herring <$$font> dies soonest
out of the water , and of fresh-water-fish the <font> Trout <$$font> ,
so <paren> except the <font> Eel <$$font> <$$paren> the <font> Carp
<$$font> endures most hardness , WALTON-1676-E3-H,292.223

and lives longest out of his own proper Element .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,292.224

And therefore the report of the Carps being brought out of a forraigne
Country into this Nation is the more probable .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,292.225

Carps and Loaches are observed to Breed several months in <P_293> one
year , which Pikes and most other fish do not .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.226

And this is partly proved by tame and wild <font> Rabbets <$$font> , as
also by some <font> Ducks <$$font> , which will lay eggs nine of the
twelve months , WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.227

and yet there be other <font> Ducks <$$font> that lay no longer than
about one month . WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.228

And it is the rather to be believed , because you shall scarce or never
take a <font> Male-@ @Carp <$$font> without a <font> Melt <$$font> , or
a <font> Female <$$font> without a <font> Roe <$$font> or <font> spawn
<$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.229

and for the most part very much ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.230

and especially all the Summer season ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.231

and it is observed , that they breed more naturally in ponds than in
running waters , <paren> if they breed there at all <$$paren> ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.232

and those that live in Rivers are taken by men of the best palats to be
much the better meat . WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.233

And it is observed , that in some ponds <font> Carps <$$font> will not
breed , especially in cold ponds ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.234

but where they will breed , they breed innumerably ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.235

<font> Aristotle <$$font> and <font> Pliny <$$font> say , six times in a
year , if there be no <font> Pikes <$$font> nor <font> Pearch <$$font>
to devour their Spawn , when it is cast upon grass , or flags or weeds ,
where it lies ten or twelve dayes before it be enlivened .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.236

The <font> Carp <$$font> , if he have water-room and good feed , will
grow to a very great bigness and length : WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.237

I have heard , to be much above a yard long . WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.238

'T@ @is said , <paren> by <font> Jovius <$$font> , who hath writ of
Fishes <$$paren> that in the lake <font> Lurian <$$font> in <font> Italy
, Carps <$$font> have thriven to be more than fifty pound weight , which
is the more probable , WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.239

for as the <font> Bear <$$font> is conceiv'd and born suddenly ; and
being born is but short-liv'd : So on the contrary , the <font> Elephant
<$$font> is said to be two years in his dams belly
WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.240

<paren> some think he is ten years in it <$$paren>
WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.241

and being born grows in bigness twenty years ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.242

and 't@ @is observ'd too that he lives to the Age of a_hundred years .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.243

And 't@ @is also observ'd that the <font> Crocodile <$$font> is very
long-liv'd , and more than that , that all that long life he thrives in
bigness , WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.244

and so I think some <font> Carps <$$font> do , especially in some places
; though I never saw one above 23. inches , which was a great and
goodly Fish : WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.245

But have been assured there are of a far greater size , and in <font>
England <$$font> too . WALTON-1676-E3-H,293.246

Now , as the increase of <font> Carps <$$font> is wonderful for their
number ; so there is not a reason found out , I think by any , why they
should breed in some Ponds , and not in others of the same <P_294>
nature , for soil and all other circumstances : WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.247

and as their breeding , so are their decays also very mysterious :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.248

I have both read it , and been told by a Gentleman of tryed honesty ,
that he has known sixty or more large <font> Carps <$$font> put into
several ponds near to a house , where by reason of the stakes in the
ponds , and the Owners constant being near to them , it was impossible
they should be stole away from him : and that when he has after three or
four years emptyed the pond , and expected an increase from them by
breeding young ones <paren> for that they might do so , he had , as the
rule is , put in three Melters for one Spawner <$$paren> he has , I say
, after three or four years , found neither a young nor old <font> Carp
<$$font> remaining . WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.249

And the like I have known of one that has almost watched the pond ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.250

and at a like distance of time , at the fishing of a pond , found of
seventy or eighty large <font> Carps <$$font> not above five or six :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.251

and that he had forborn longer to fish the said pond ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.252

but he saw in a hot day in Summer , a large <font> Carp <$$font> swim
near the top of the water with a Frog upon his head ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.253

and that he upon that occasion caused his pond to be let dry :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.254

and I say , of seventy or eighty <font> Carps <$$font> , only found five
or six in the said pond , and those very sick and lean , and with every
one a Frog sticking so fast on the head of the said <font> Carps
<$$font> , that the <font> Frog <$$font> would not be got off without
extreme force or killing : WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.255

and the Gentleman that did affirm this to me , told me he saw it ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.256

and did declare his belief to be , <paren> and also I believe the same
<$$paren> that he thought the other <font> Carps <$$font> that were so
strangely lost , were so killed by frogs , and then devoured .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.257

And a person of honour now living in <font> Worcestershire <$$font>
assur'd me he had seen a necklace or collar of Tadpoles hang like a
chaine or necklace of beads about a <font> Pikes <$$font> neck , and to
kill him ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.258

whether it were for meat or malice , must be to me a question .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.259

But I am faln into this Discourse by accident , of which I might say
more , WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.260

but it has proved longer than I intended , WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.261

and possibly may not to you be considerable ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.262

I shall therefore give you three or four more short observations of the
<font> Carp <$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.263

and then fall upon some directions how you shall fish for him .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,294.264

The age of Carps is by Sir <font> Francis Bacon <$$font> <paren> in his
History of Life <P_295> and Death <$$paren> observed to be but ten years
; WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.265

yet others think they live longer . WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.266

<font> Gesner <$$font> saies a <font> Carp <$$font> has been known to
live in the <font> Palatinate <$$font> above a_hundred years :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.267

But most conclude , that <paren> contrary to the <font> Pike <$$font> or
<font> Luce <$$font> <$$paren> all <font> Carps <$$font> are the better
for age and bigness ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.268

the Tongues of <font> Carps <$$font> are noted to be choice and costly
meat , especially to them that buy them : WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.269

but <font> Gesner <$$font> saies , <font> Carps <$$font> have no tongue
like other Fish , but a piece of flesh-like-Fish in their mouth like to
a tongue , WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.270

and should be called a palate : WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.271

But it is certain it is choicely good , and that the <font> Carp
<$$font> is to be reckoned amongst those leather-mouthed fish , which I
told you have their teeth in their throat , WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.272

and for that reason he is very seldom lost by breaking his hold , if
your hook be once stuck into his chaps . WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.273

I told you that Sir <font> Francis Bacon <$$font> thinks that the <font>
Carp <$$font> lives but ten years , WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.274

but <font> Janus Dubravius <$$font> has writ a Book of Fish and
Fishponds , in which he saies , That <font> Carps <$$font> begin to
Spawn at the age of three years , and continue to do so till thirty :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.275

he says also , That in the time of their breeding , which is in Summer ,
when the Sun hath warmed both the earth and water , and so apted them
also for generation ; that then three or four <font> Male-@ @Carps
<$$font> will follow a Female ; and that then she putting on a seeming
coyness , they force her through weeds and flags , where she lets fall
her Eggs or Spawn , which sticks fast to the weeds ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.276

and then they let fall their Melt upon it , WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.277

and so it becomes in a short time to be a living Fish ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.278

and as I told you , it is thought the <font> Carp <$$font> does this
several months in the year , WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.279

and most believe that most fish breed after this manner , except the Eel
: WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.280

and it has been observed , that when the Spawner has weakned her self by
doing that natural office , that two or three Melters have helped her
from off the weeds , by bearing her up on both sides , and guarding her
into the deep . WALTON-1676-E3-H,295.281

And you may note , that though this may seem a curiosity not worth
observing , yet others have judged it worth their time and costs , to
make <font> Glass-hives <$$font> , and order them in such a manner as to
see how <font> Bees <$$font> have bred and <P_296> made their <font>
Honey-combs <$$font> , and how they have obeyed their King , and
governed their Common-wealth . WALTON-1676-E3-H,296.282

But it is thought that all <font> Carps <$$font> are not bred by
generation , but that some breed other ways , as some <font> Pikes
<$$font> do . WALTON-1676-E3-H,296.283

The Physicians make the <font> galls <$$font> and <font> stones <$$font>
in the heads of <font> Carps <$$font> to be very medicinable ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,296.284

but 't@ @is not to be doubted but that in <font> Italy <$$font> they
make great profit of the Spawn of <font> Carps <$$font> , by selling it
to the <font> Jews <$$font> , who make it into red <font> Caviare
<$$font> , the <font> Jews <$$font> not being by their Law admitted to
eat of <font> Caviare <$$font> made of the <font> Sturgeon <$$font> ,
that being a Fish that wants scales , and <paren> as may appear in
<font> Levit. <$$font> 11. <$$paren> by them reputed to be unclean .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,296.285

Much more might be said out of him , and out of <font> Aristotle
<$$font> , which <font> Dubravius <$$font> often quotes in his Discourse
of Fishes ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,296.286

but it might rather perplex than satisfie you , WALTON-1676-E3-H,296.287

and therefore I shall rather chuse to direct you how to catch , than
spend more time in discoursing either of the nature or the breeding of
this <font> Carp <$$font> , {COM:figure_omitted} or of any more
circumstances concerning him ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,296.288

but yet I shall remember you of what I told you before , that he is a
very subtil Fish , and hard to be caught . WALTON-1676-E3-H,296.289

And my first direction is , that if you will Fish for a <font> Carp
<$$font> , you must put on a very large measure of <font> patience
<$$font> ; especially to fish for a <font> River Carp <$$font> :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,296.290

I have known a very good Fisher angle diligently four or six hours in a
day , for three or four daies together for a <font> River Carp <$$font>
, and not have a bite : WALTON-1676-E3-H,296.291

and you are to note , that in some ponds it is as hard to catch a Carp
as in a River ; that is to say , where they have store of feed , and the
<P_297> water is of clayish colour : WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.292

But you are to remember , that I have told you there is no rule without
an exception , WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.293

and therefore being possest with that hope and patience which I wish to
all Fishers , especially to the <font> Carp-Angler <$$font> , I shall
tell you with what bait to fish for him . WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.294

But first you are to know , that it must be either early or late ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.295

and let me tell you , that in hot weather <paren> for he will seldom
bite in cold <$$paren> you can@ @not be too early or too late at it .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.296

And some have been so curious as to say , the 10. of <font> April
<$$font> is a fatal day for Carps . WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.297

The Carp bites either at worms or at paste ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.298

and of worms I think the blewish Marsh or Meadow worm is best ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.299

but possibly another worm not too big may do as well ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.300

and so may a green Gentle : WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.301

And as for pastes , there are almost as many sorts as there are
Medicines for the Toothach , WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.302

but doubtless sweet pastes are best ; I mean , pastes made with honey or
with sugar : which , that you may the better beguile this crafty Fish ,
should be thrown into the Pond or place in which you fish for him some
hours or longer before you undertake your tryal of skill with the
Angle-rod : WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.303

and doubtless if it be thrown into the water a day or two before , at
several times and in small pellets , you are the likelier when you fish
for the Carp to obtain your desired sport ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.304

or in a large Pond to draw them to any certain place , that they may the
better and with more hope be fished for , you are to throw into it in
some certain place , either Grains or Blood mixt with Cow dung , or with
Bran ; or any Garbage , as Chickens guts or the like , and then some of
your small sweet pellets with which you purpose to angle :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.305

and these small pellets being a few of them also thrown in as you are
Angling will be the better . WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.306

And your paste must be thus made : WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.307

Take the flesh of a Rabbet or Cat cut small , and Bean-flowre ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.308

and if that may not be easily got , get other flowre ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.309

and then mix these together , WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.310

and put to them either Sugar , or Honey , which I think better ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.311

and then beat these together in a Mortar , WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.312

or sometimes work them in your hands , <paren> your hands being very
clean <$$paren> WALTON-1676-E3-H,297.313

and then <P_298> make it into a Ball , or two , or three , as you like
best for your use ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.314

but you must work or pound it so long in the Mortar , as to make it so
tough as to hang upon your hook without washing from it , yet not too
hard ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.315

or that you may the better keep it on your hook , you may knead with
your paste a little <paren> and not much <$$paren> white or yellowish
wool . WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.316

And if you would have this paste keep all the year for any other Fish ,
then mix it with <font> Virgin wax <$$font> and <font> clarified honey
<$$font> , and work them together with your hands before the Fire , then
make these into balls , and they will keep all the year .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.317

And if you fish for a Carp with Gentles , then put upon your hook a
small piece of Scarlet about this bigness {COM:figure_omitted} , it
being soked in , or anointed with <font> Oyl of Peter <$$font> , called
by some <font> Oyl of the Rock <$$font> ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.318

and if your Gentles be put two or three dayes before into a box or horn
anointed with honey , and so put upon your hook as to preserve them to
be living , you are as like to kill this crafty fish this way as any
other . WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.319

But still as you are fishing chaw a little white or brown bread in your
mouth , WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.320

and cast it into the pond about the place where your Flote swims .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.321

Other baits there be , WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.322

but these with diligence , and patient watchfulness , will do it better
than any that I have ever practised , or heard of :
WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.323

And yet I shall tell you , that the crumbs of white bread and honey made
into a paste is a good bait for a <font> Carp <$$font> ,
WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.324

and you know it is more easily made . WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.325

And having said thus much of the <font> Carp <$$font> , my next
discourse shall be of the <font> Bream <$$font> , which shall not prove
so tedious , WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.326

and therefore I desire the continuance of your attention .
WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.327

But first I will tell you how to make this <font> Carp <$$font> that is
so curious to be caught , so curious a dish of meat , as shall make him
worth all your labour and patience ; WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.328

and though it is not without some trouble and charges , yet it will
recompence both . WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.329

<font> Take a <$$font> Carp <font> <paren> alive if possible <$$paren>
WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.330

scour him , WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.331

and rub him clean with water and salt , WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.332

but scale him not , WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.333

then open him , WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.334

and put him with his bloud and his liver <paren> which you must save
when you open him <$$paren> into a small pot or kettle ;
WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.335

then take sweet Marjoram , Time and Parsley , of each half a handful , a
sprig of Rosemary , and another of Savoury , WALTON-1676-E3-H,298.336
