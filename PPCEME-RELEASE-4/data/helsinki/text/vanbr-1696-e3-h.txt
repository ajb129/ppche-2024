ACT II . VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.4

SCENE I . VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.5

<$$heading>

<paren> <font> London . A Room in <$$font> Loveless's <font> Lodgings
<$$font> . <$$paren> VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.7

<font> Enter <$$font> Loveless <font> and <$$font> Amanda .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.8

<font> Lov. <$$font> How do you like these Lodgings , my Dear ?
VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.9

For my part , I am so well pleas'd with 'em , I shall hardly remove
whilst we stay in Town , if you are satisfy'd . VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.10

<font> Aman. <$$font> I am satisfy'd with every thing that pleases you
; VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.11

else I had not come to Town at all . VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.12

<font> Lov. <$$font> O , a little of the noise and bussle of the World
, sweetens the Pleasures of Retreat : VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.13

We shall find the Charms of our Retirement doubled , when we return to
it . VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.14

<font> Aman. <$$font> That pleasing Prospect will be my chiefest
Entertainment , whilst <paren> much against my Will <$$paren> I am
oblig'd to stand surrounded with these empty Pleasures , which 't@ @is
so much the fashion to be fond of . VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.15

<font> Lov. <$$font> I own most of 'em are indeed but empty : nay so
empty , that one wou'd wonder by what Magick Power they act , when they
induce us to be vicious for their sakes . VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.16

Yet some there are we may speak kindlier of : VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.17

There are Delights , <paren> of which a private Life is destitute
<$$paren> which may divert an honest Man , and be a harmless
Entertainment to a virtuous Woman . VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.18

The Conversation of the Town is one ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.19

and truly , <paren> with some small Allowances <$$paren> the Plays , I
think , may be esteem'd another . VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.20

<font> Aman. <$$font> The Plays , I must confess , have some small
Charms , VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.21

and wou'd have more , wou'd they restrain that loose obscene
encouragement to Vice , which shocks , if not the Virtue of some Women ,
at least the Modesty of all . VANBR-1696-E3-H,32.22

<P_33>

<font> Lov. <$$font> But till that Reformation can be made , I wou'd
not leave the whol'some Corn , for some intruding Tares that grow
amongst it . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.24

Doubtless , the Moral of a well-wrought Scene is of prevailing Force .
- VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.25

Last Night there happen'd one that mov'd me strangely .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.26

<font> Aman. <$$font> Pray , what was that ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.27

<font> Lov. <$$font> Why 't@ @was about - VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.28

but 't@ @is not worth repeating . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.29

<font> Aman. <$$font> Yes , pray let me know it .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.30

<font> Lov. <$$font> No , I think 't@ @is as well let alone .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.31

<font> Aman. <$$font> Nay , now you make me have a mind to know .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.32

<font> Lov. <$$font> 'T@ @was a foolish thing : VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.33

You@ @'d perhaps grow jealous shou'd I tell it you , tho' without a
cause Heaven knows . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.34

<font> Aman. <$$font> I shall begin to think I have Cause , if you
persist in making it a secret . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.35

<font> Lov. <$$font> I@ @'ll then convince you , you have none by
making it no longer so . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.36

Know then , I happen'd in the Play to find my very Character , only with
the Addition of a <font> Relapse <$$font> ; which struck me so , I put a
suddain stop to a most harmless Entertainment , which till then ,
diverted me between the Acts . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.37

'T@ @was to admire the workmanship of Nature , in the Face of a young
Lady , that sat some distance from me , VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.38

she was so exquisitely handsome . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.39

<font> Aman. <$$font> So exquisitely handsome ! VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.40

<font> Lov. <$$font> Why do you repeat my words , my Dear ?
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.41

<font> Aman. <$$font> Because you seem'd to speak 'em with such
pleasure , I thought I might oblige you with their Eccho .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.42

<font> Lov. <$$font> Then you are allarmed , <font> Amanda <$$font> ?
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.43

<font> Aman. <$$font> It is my Duty to be so , when you are in danger .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.44

<font> Lov. <$$font> You are too quick in apprehending for me ;
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.45

all will be well when you have heard me out . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.46

I do confess I gaz'd upon her ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.47

nay , eagerly I gaz'd upon her . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.48

<font> Aman. <$$font> Eagerly ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.49

That@ @'s with desire . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.50

<font> Lov. <$$font> No , I desir'd her not ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.51

I view'd her with a world of admiration , but not one glance of Love .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.52

<font> Aman. <$$font> Take heed of trusting to such nice Distinctions .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.53

<font> Lov. <$$font> I did take heed ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.54

for observing in the Play , That he who seem'd to represent me there ,
was by an Accident like this , unwarily surpriz'd into a Net , in which
he lay a poor intangl'd Slave , and brought a Train of mischiefs on his
Head ; I snatcht my Eyes away : VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.55

they pleaded hard for leave to look again , VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.56

but I grew absolute , VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.57

and they obey'd . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.58

<font> Aman. <$$font> Were they the only things that were Inquisitive ?
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.59

Had I been in your place , my Tongue , I fancy , had been curious too ;
VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.60

I shou'd have ask'd her Name , and where she liv'd , <paren> yet still
without Design : <$$paren> - VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.61

Who was she , pray ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.62

<font> Lov. <$$font> Indeed I can@ @not tell . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.63

<font> Aman. <$$font> You will not tell . VANBR-1696-E3-H,33.64

<P_34>

<font> Lov. <$$font> By all that@ @'s Sacred then , I did not ask .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.66

<font> Aman. <$$font> Nor do you know what company was with her ?
VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.67

<font> Lov. <$$font> I do not . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.68

<font> Aman. <$$font> Then I am calm again . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.69

<font> Lov. <$$font> Why were you disturb'd ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.70

<font> Aman. <$$font> Had I then no Cause ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.71

<font> Lov. <$$font> None certainly . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.72

<font> Aman. <$$font> I thought I had . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.73

<font> Lov. <$$font> But you thought wrong , <font> Amanda <$$font> ;
VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.74

For turn the Case , VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.75

and let it be your Story : VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.76

shou'd you come home and tell me you had seen a handsome Man , shou'd I
grow jealous , because you had Eyes ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.77

<font> Aman. <$$font> But shou'd I tell you , he were exquisitely so :
That I had gaz'd on him with Admiration : That I had look'd with eager
Eyes upon him , shou'd you not think 'T@ @were possible I might go one
step farther , and enquire his Name ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.78

<font> Lov. <$$font> <paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> She has
Reason on her side : VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.79

I have talk'd too much : VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.80

But I must turn it off another way . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.81

<paren> <font> To Aman. <$$font> <$$paren> Will you then make no
difference , <font> Amanda <$$font> , between the Language of our Sex
and yours ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.82

There is a Modesty restrains your Tongues , which makes you speak by
halves when you commend ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.83

but roving Flattery gives a loose to ours , which makes us still speak
double what we think : VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.84

You shou'd not therefore , in so strict a sense , take what I said to
her Advantage . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.85

<font> Aman. <$$font> Those flights of Flattery , Sir , are to our
Faces only : VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.86

When Women once are out of hearing , you are as modest in your
Commendations as we are . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.87

But I sha@ @n't put you to the trouble of farther Excuses , if you
please this Business shall rest here . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.88

Only give me leave to wish both for your Peace and mine , that you may
never meet this Miracle of Beauty more . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.89

<font> Lov. <$$font> I am content . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.90

<font> Enter Servant . <$$font> VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.91

<font> Serv. <$$font> Madam , there@ @'s a young Lady at the Door in a
Chair , desires to know whether your Ladyship sees Company .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.92

I think her Name is <font> Berinthia <$$font> . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.93

<font> Aman. <$$font> O dear ! VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.94

'T@ @is a Relation I have not seen this five Years .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.95

Pray her to walk in . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.96

<paren> <font> Exit Servant . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.97

To Lov. <$$font> <$$paren> Here@ @'s another Beauty for you .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.98

She was young when I saw her last ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.99

but I hear she@ @'s grown extremely handsome . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.100

<font> Lov. <$$font> Do@ @n't you be jealous now ;
VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.101

for I shall gaze upon her too . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.102

<font> Enter <$$font> Berinthia . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.103

<font> Lov. <$$font> <paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> Ha ! By
Heavens the very Woman . VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.104

<font> Ber. <$$font> <paren> <font> saluting Aman. <$$font> <$$paren>
Dear <font> Amanda <$$font> , I did not expect to meet with you in Town
. VANBR-1696-E3-H,34.105

<P_35>

<font> Aman. <$$font> Sweet Cousin , I@ @'m over-joy'd to see you .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.107

<paren> <font> To Lov. <$$font> <$$paren> Mr. <font> Loveless <$$font>
, here@ @'s a Relation and a Friend of mine , I desire you@ @'ll be
better acquainted with . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.108

<font> Lov. <$$font> <paren> <font> saluting Ber. <$$font> <$$paren>
If my Wife never desires a harder thing , Madam , her Request will be
easily granted . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.109

<font> Ber. <$$font> <paren> <font> to Aman. <$$font> <$$paren> I
think , Madam , I ought to wish you Joy . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.110

<font> Aman. <$$font> Joy ! VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.111

Upon what ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.112

<font> Ber. <$$font> Upon your Marriage : VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.113

You were a Widow when I saw you last . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.114

<font> Lov. <$$font> You ought rather , Madam , to wish me Joy upon
that , since I am the only Gainer . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.115

<font> Ber. <$$font> If she has got so good a Husband as the World
reports , she has gain'd enough to expect the Complements of her Friends
upon it . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.116

<font> Lov. <$$font> If the World is so favourable to me , to allow I
deserve that Title , I hope 't@ @is so just to my Wife to own I derive
it from her . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.117

<font> Ber. <$$font> Sir , it is so just to you both , to own you are ,
<paren> and deserve to be , <$$paren> the happiest Pair that live in it
. VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.118

<font> Lov. <$$font> I@ @'m afraid we shall lose that Character , Madam
, whenever you happen to change your Condition . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.119

<font> Enter Servant . <$$font> VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.120

<font> Ser. <$$font> Sir , my Lord <font> Foppington <$$font> presents
his humble Service to you , VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.121

and desires to know how you do . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.122

He but just now heard you were in Town . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.123

He@ @'s at the next door ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.124

and if it be not inconvenient , he@ @'ll come and wait upon you .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.125

<font> Lov. <$$font> Lord <font> Foppington <$$font> ! -
VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.126

I know him not . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.127

<font> Ber. <$$font> Not his Dignity , perhaps , VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.128

but you do his Person . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.129

'T@ @is Sir <font> Novelty <$$font> ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.130

he has bought a Barony in order to marry a great Fortune :
VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.131

His Patent has not been pass'd eight-and-forty Hours ,
VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.132

and he has already sent How-do-ye's to all the Town , to make 'em
acquainted with his Title . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.133

<font> Lov. <$$font> Give my Service to his Lordship ,
VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.134

and let him know , I am proud of the Honour he intends me .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.135

<paren> <font> Ex. Ser. <$$font> <$$paren> VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.136

Sure this Addition of Quality , must have so improv'd this Coxcomb , he
ca@ @n't but be very good Company for a quarter of an Hour .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.137

<font> Aman. <$$font> Now it moves my Pity more than my Mirth , to see
a Man whom Nature has made no Fool , be so very industrious to pass for
an Ass . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.138

<font> Lov. <$$font> No , there you are wrong , <font> Amanda <$$font>
; VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.139

you shou'd never bestow your pity upon those who take pains for your
Contempt . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.140

Pity those whom Nature abuses but never those who abuse Nature .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.141

<font> Ber. <$$font> Besides , the Town wou'd be robb'd of one of its
chief Diversions , if it shou'd become a Crime to laugh at a Fool .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.142

<font> Aman. <$$font> I cou'd never yet perceive the Town inclin'd to
part with any of its diversions , for the sake of their being Crimes ;
VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.143

but I have seen it very fond of some , I think , had little else to
recommend 'em . VANBR-1696-E3-H,35.144

<P_36>

<font> Ber. <$$font> I doubt , <font> Amanda <$$font> , you are grown
its Enemy , you speak with so much warmth against it .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.146

<font> Aman. <$$font> I must confess I am not much its Friend .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.147

<font> Ber. <$$font> Then give me leave to make you mine , by not
engaging in its Quarrel . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.148

<font> Aman. <$$font> You have many stronger Claims than that , <font>
Berinthia <$$font> , whenever you think fit to plead your Title .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.149

<font> Lov. <$$font> You have done well to engage a Second , my Dear ;
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.150

for here {SIC:he} comes one will be apt to call you to an account for
your Country-Principles . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.151

<font> Enter Lord <$$font> Foppington . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.152

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> <paren> <font> to Lov. <$$font> <$$paren>
Sir , I am your most humble Servant . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.153

<font> Lov. <$$font> I wish you Joy , my Lord . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.154

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> O Lard , Sir - Madam , your Ladyship@ @'s
welcome to Tawn . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.155

<font> Aman. <$$font> I wish your Lordship Joy .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.156

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> O Heavens , Madam - VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.157

<font> Lov. <$$font> My Lord , this young Lady is a Relation of my
Wives . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.158

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> <paren> <font> saluting her . <$$font>
<$$paren> The beautifull'st Race of People upon Earth :
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.159

Rat {COM:lemma_sic} me . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.160

Dear <font> Loveless <$$font> , I am overjoy'd to see you have braught
your Family to Tawn again ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.161

I am , stap my Vitals - VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.162

<paren> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$paren> Far I design to lye with your
Wife . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.163

<paren> <font> To Aman. <$$font> <$$paren> Far Gad's sake , Madam , haw
has your Ladyship been able to subsist thus long , under the Fatigue of
a Country Life ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.164

<font> Aman. <$$font> My Life has been very far from that , my Lord ;
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.165

it has been a very quiet one . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.166

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Why , that@ @'s the Fatigue I speak of ,
Madam : VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.167

For 't@ @is impossible to be quiet , without thinking :
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.168

Now thinking is to me , the greatest Fatigue in the World .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.169

<font> Aman. <$$font> Does not your Lordship love reading then ?
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.170

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Oh , passionately , Madam -
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.171

But I never think of what I read . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.172

<font> Ber. <$$font> Why , can your Lordship read without thinking ?
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.173

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> O Lard - Can your Ladyship pray without
Devotion - Madam ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.174

<font> Aman. <$$font> Well , I must own I think Books the best
Entertainment in the World . VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.175

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> I am so much of your Ladyship's Mind , Madam
; that I have a private Gallery <paren> where I walk sometimes <$$paren>
is furnish'd with nothing but Books and Looking-glasses .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.176

Madam , I have guilded 'em , and rang'd 'em , so prettily , before Gad ,
it is the most entertaining thing in the World to walk and look upon 'em
. VANBR-1696-E3-H,36.177

<P_37>

<font> Aman. <$$font> Nay , I love a neat Library too ;
VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.179

but 't@ @is , I think , the Inside of a Book shou'd recommend it most to
us . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.180

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> That , I must confess , I am nat altogether
so fand of . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.181

Far to mind the inside of a Book , is to entertain ones self with the
forc'd Product of another Man's Brain . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.182

Naw I think a Man of Quality and Breeding may be much diverted with the
Natural Sprauts of his own . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.183

But to say the truth , Madam , let a Man love reading never so well ,
when once he comes to know this Tawn , he finds so many better ways of
passing away {COM:sic} the Four_and_Twenty Hours , that 't@ @were
Ten_Thousand pities he shou'd consume his time in that .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.184

Far example , Madam , my Life ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.185

my Life , Madam , is a perpetual Stream of Pleasure , that glides thro'
such a Variety of Entertainments , I believe the wisest of our Ancestors
never had the least Conception of any of 'em . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.186

I rise , Madam , about Ten a-Clock . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.187

I do@ @n't rise sooner , because 't@ @is the worst thing in the World
for the Complexion ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.188

nat that I pretend to be a Beau ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.189

but a Man must endeavour to look wholesome , lest he makes so nauseous a
Figure in the Side-bax , the Ladies shou'd be compell'd to turn their
Eyes upon the Play . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.190

So at Ten o'clock I say I rise . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.191

Naw if I find 't@ @is a good Day , I resalve to take a Turn in the Park

so huddle on my Cloaths , VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.193

and get dress'd by One . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.194

If it be nasty Weather , I take a Turn in the Chocolate-hause ; where ,
as you walk , Madam , you have the prettiest Prospect in the World ;
VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.195

you have Looking-glasses all round you - VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.196

But I@ @'m afraid I tire the Company . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.197

<font> Ber. <$$font> Not at all . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.198

Pray go on . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.199

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Why then , Ladies , from thence I go to
Dinner at <font> Lacket's <$$font> , VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.200

and there you are so nicely and delicately serv'd , that , stap my
Vitals , they shall compose you a Dish , no bigger than a Saucer , shall
come to fifty Shillings . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.201

Between eating my Dinner , <paren> and washing my Mauth , Ladies
<$$paren> I spend my time , till I go to the Play ; where , till Nine
a-Clack , I entertain my self with looking upon the Company ; and
usually dispose of one Hour more in leading them aut .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.202

So there@ @'s twelve of the Four-and-Twenty pretty well over .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.203

The other Twelve , Madam , are dispos'd of in Two Articles :
VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.204

In the first Four , I toast my self drunk , VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.205

and in t'@ @other Eight I sleep my self sober again .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.206

Thus , Ladies , you see my Life is an eternal raund O of Delights .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.207

<font> Lov. <$$font> 'T@ @is a heavenly one , indeed !
VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.208

<font> Aman. <$$font> But , my Lord , you <font> Beaux <$$font> spend a
great deal of your Time in Intrigues : VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.209

You have given us no Account of them yet . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.210

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> <paren> <font> aside . <$$font> <$$paren>
Soh , she wou'd enquire into my Amours - VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.211

That@ @'s Jealousie - VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.212

She begins to be in love with me . VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.213

<paren> <font> To Aman. <$$font> <$$paren> Why , Madam - as to time for
my Intrigues , I usually make Detachments of it from my other Pleasures
, according to the Exigency : VANBR-1696-E3-H,37.214

Far your Ladyship <P_38> may please to take notice , that those who
intrigue with Women of Quality , have rarely occasion far above half an
Hour at a time : VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.215

People of that Rank being under those Decorums , they can seldom give
you a langer View , than will just serve to shoot 'em flying . So that
the Course of my other Pleasures is not very much interrupted by my
Amours . VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.216

<font> Lov. <$$font> But your Lordship now is become a Pillar of the
State ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.217

you must attend the weighty Affairs of the Nation .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.218

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Sir - as to weighty Affairs - I leave them to
weighty Heads . VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.219

I never intend mine shall be a Burthen to my Body .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.220

<font> Lov. <$$font> O , but you@ @'ll find the House will expect your
Attendance . VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.221

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Sir , you@ @'ll find the House will compound

<font> Lov. <$$font> But your Friends will take it ill if you do@ @n't
attend their particular Causes . VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.223

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Not , Sir , if I come time enough to give 'em
my particular Vote . VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.224

<font> Ber. <$$font> But pray , my Lord , how do you dispose of
yourself on <font> Sundays <$$font> ; VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.225

for that , me@ @thinks , shou'd hang wretchedly on your hands .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.226

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Why , Faith , Madam - <font> Sunday <$$font>
- is a vile day , I must confess . VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.227

I intend to move for leave to bring in a Bill , That the Players may
work upon it , as well as the Hackney Coaches . VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.228

Tho' this I must say for the Government , it leaves us the Churches to
entertain us - VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.229

But then again , they begin so abominable early , a Man must rise by
Candle-light to get dress'd by the Psalm . VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.230

<font> Ber. <$$font> Pray which Church does your Lordship most oblige
with your Presence ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.231

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Oh , St. <font> James's <$$font> , Madam -
VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.232

VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.234

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Why , Faith , Madam - I ca@ @n't tell .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.235

A Man must have very little to do there , that can give an Account of
the Sermon . VANBR-1696-E3-H,38.236

<font> Ber. <$$font> You can give us an Account of the Ladies , at

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Or I deserve to be excommunicated -

<font> Miss . <$$font> Pray , my Lord , how long is it ?
VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.597

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Madam , a_thousand year - a whole Week .
VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.598

<font> Miss . <$$font> A week - VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.599

why , I shall be an old Woman by that time . VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.600

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> And I an old Man , which you@ @'ll find a
greater Misfortune than t'@ @other . VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.601

<font> Miss . <$$font> Why I thought 't@ @was to be to_morrow morning ,

<font> Miss . <$$font> If I@ @'ll consent ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.605

Why I thought I was to obey you as my Husband ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.606

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> That@ @'s when we are Married ;
VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.607

<font> Miss . <$$font> Why then if we are to take it by turns , it@ @'s

I@ @'ll obey you now , VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.610

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> With all my heart , VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.612

but I doubt we must get Nurse on our side , VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.613

or we shall hardly prevail with the Chaplain . VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.614

<font> Miss . <$$font> No more we sha@ @n't indeed ,

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> How@ @'s that ? VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.620

and give her Half a Crown . VANBR-1696-E3-H,62.622

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Nay , if that will do , she shall have half a

Now all things being Sign'd , and Seal'd , and Agreed , I fancy there
