O moste terryble examples , lefte wrytyn yn the holy scryptures , that

So I wente with hym , MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,202.98

MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,203.99

" Whate meanythe thys people ? " sayd I to the keapar .
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,203.100

" Al thes are come <paren> sayde he , <$$paren> to see yow suffer deathe

MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,203.106

Whan theye were all gone , the kepar callyd me downe , to dyne with hym

and , dynnar beynge endyd , we fele yn talke agayne ,
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,203.108

and so , from tyme to tyme , had moche conferences together ,
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,203.109

and I {COM:preceding_word_"I"_emended} began to growe yn greate credite
with hym , insomuche that whansoever he ryd forthe aboughte anye busynes

and laboryd unto the hye shyryfe for me that I myght be delyveryd .
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,203.111

Notwithstandinge , I remaynyd ther prysonar halve a yeare , yn moche

MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,203.112

yea and manye tymes glad whan that I myghte gete a penye loffe and my

and at mydnyghte alwaye whan they searched the prysonars' iornys than
one shold come and knock at my dore and aske me yf I were withyn . To
home I answeryd alwaye thus , " Here I ham , mr. kepar . "
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,203.114

" Good nyghte , than , " sayed he ; MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,203.115

and so wold goo their wayes . MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,203.116

Now on a sartayne daye , beynge merye , he browghte home with hym to see
me dyveres honeste men of the towne ; amonge home there was one that I
never sawe before , nor he me , callyd mr. Segare a <P_204> berebruar ,
dwelynge at Madelyn bryge , whose harte God oppynyd above the reste to
showe marsy unto me , MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.117

for he knewe that the keapar wold doo muche at hys requeste , so that or

dyssyerynge hym to showe me favore for hys sake ,
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.118

" and I wyll be bound for hyme , that he shal be trwe prysonar . "
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.119

Al thys plesyd Charlys the kepar well , MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.120

and yt was no greffe at all to me , to here thys bargayne made betwen

" for otherwyse , <paren> sayd I , <$$paren> yt was not unlyke but that

MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.122

And her ys not to be forgotyn of my parte the myghtye and fatherlye
provydence of God , who never fayellethe any man that trwelye putes hys

Who can kylle hym , mr. Charlys , whome God wyll kepe alyve ? maye I

and who can dellyver hym whom God wyl destrowe ?
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.125

His greate powere delyveryd me ones owte of the lyones deen as he dyd
hys holy prophet Danyell ; MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.126

so I truste that he wyll delyver me here owt of all my troubles , yf he
so see yt good . MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.127

Yf not , hys wyl be done ! " MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.128

And thus we partyd for that tyme , my kepare beynge glad of thys hys

hopynge for my dellyverance . MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.129

After thys , withyn short tyme , the hye shyryffe sent for me home to
hys howse beyond Huntyngton , to see whether I woold relente or no ;
tellynge me that he hade wrytyn up to the counsell for me , and that yt
was their plesure that I shoulde be delyveryd yf that I wolde be a
confyrmable man to the quenes prosedynges , and forsake herysy , or eles
to remayne yn pryson untyll the nexte sessyons of gale delyvery .
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.130

" For your good wyl , I doo thanke your mastership moste hartelye ,
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,204.131

and well contentyd I hame so to remayn as a prysonar ,

" Wel ! <paren> sayde he , <$$paren> I parsave than that yow are no

So wee toke our leve of hyme , MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,205.136

and came our wayes bake agayne to Huntyngeton ,

MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,205.138

and beynge bed to supar of one Thomas Whype , marchante of London , with

Thys dyssyer of my frendyes was schares well lyked of my keapar ,

and grawnte yt he wold not yn no wyse . MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,205.143

So , when suppar was done , to our chamber wee wente ,
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,205.144

and anon comyse yn a smythe with a hammer and a greate stapyle .
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,205.145

" Make yow redye , <paren> sayd he , <$$paren> I pray yow ,

So I layed me downe apon my bed . MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,205.148

Than he calde the smythe unto hym , MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,205.149

and sayed , " Make faste the staple and the cheyne together ,
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,205.150

Than he loked behyend all the payentyd clothes to see yf there were anye

That done , he locked the dore MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,205.154

and caste the keye owte of the wyndow , to the goodman of the house ,
dyssyeryng him to kepe yt save wylle the mornynge .
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,205.155

Smale reste I toke that nyghte , MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,205.156

I was so sore wronge aboughte my wreste that the blud was redy to spyn

God delyver yow out of their handys , and yt be hys wyll ! "
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,210.279

Than wente I over ynto Sowthewarke , MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,210.280

and there laye all nyghte . MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,210.281

Yn the mornyng I roose up early , MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,210.282

and whansoever I myghte geate ynto an haye-loffet , I thowghte myselve

At the laste I was howsyd , I thanke God , with an_n@ @oneste man ,

and the same havynge a wycked sarvante , not lovynge the gospelle , went

MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,211.296

" Howe knowe yow that ? <paren> sayd theye , <$$paren>

and therfore I knowe by the smooke that there ys one yndeed . "
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,211.304

So the ofysars wyllyd hym to goo abowghte hys busynes , and to saye

Yn the meane tyme they did hys master to understand whate hys man had

for they wolde searche hys howse that nyghte ;
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,211.309

but the byrdes were flone . MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,211.311

The nexte daye , the offysares toke hys man ,

MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,212.314

and also gave unto the offysars a great charge , that from tyme to tyme
dylygent search shoulde be made yn every howse for all strangers , and
to take them and brynge them before a justyes ;
MOWNTAYNE-1555-E1-H,212.316

" for thys towne <paren> sayed he <$$paren> ys a harboror of all

So whan he had bownd them all yn recounysanse , he wylyd them to departe
