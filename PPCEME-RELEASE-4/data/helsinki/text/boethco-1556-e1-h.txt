And the same good is the fountayne of al good .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,73.205

For why ? BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,73.206

euery thyng that is called vnparfytte , the same is taken vnperfit by
diminishing of y=e= thing that is perfytte . Whereby it commethe to
passe , that yf <paren> in any kynde of thynge <$$paren> any thing is

For yf thou thynkest that God hath receyued the sayde good outwardlye of

hym faine that can , who hath ioyned together these diuers thynges ,
that is to say , God and soueraygne good . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,74.251

Farthermore the thinge that differeth from euery thing , the same is not
the verye same thynge , that it differeth from . So that the thing that
diffreth from soueraygne good , is not by nature of it selfe , the same

Truelye it is manyfest that all other things be referred vnto good .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,76.371

For therefore suffysaunce is requyred , by cause it is thought to be
good . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,76.372

Therefore power , is desired , BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,76.373

for it is thoughte also to be good . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,76.374

And lykewyse a man may coniecture of reuerence , noblesse , and plesure

Then is soueraygne good the effecte and cause of all thynges that are to
be desyred . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,76.376

For that thinge that hath no good in it self nor symylytude or likenes
of good , by no meanes ought to be desyred . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,76.377

And on the contrary wise those thynges also , that by nature be not good
, yet yf they seeme to be as they were verye good , they be desyred :
whereby it happethe that bountye or goodnes , is thought ryghtfully the
verye <P_77> effecte and cause of all thynges to be desyred or loked for

For that thyng semeth cheyfly to be desyred or wished , for the cause or
loue , wherof any thing is desyred . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,77.379

As yf a man would ryde for cause of helth , he desyreth not so much the

But we haue graunted that felicitie or blessednes is the thinge for the

wherevnto scarse any thinge is left sufficiente to resolue the same .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,105.788

For the matter that thou askest is such , that one dought beyng
determyned , other doughtes innumerable do ryse vp thereof , as the
heades of the serpent Hidra : BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,105.789

And there shoulde be no ende of the same doubtes , except a man kept in
, the same doutes wyth the quicke fyer , or serche of the wytte .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,105.790

For in thys matter men be wont to inquyre of the symplicitie or puritie
, of gods ordinaunce , of the order of destinye , of sodayne chaunces of
fortune , of the diuine knowledge and predestinacion , and of the
libertie of fre wyll . All whyche thynges , of howe greate wayte and
difficultye they be of , for to determyne , thou thy selfe doeste verye
well perseyue . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,105.791

But forasmuch as it is <P_106> parte of thy medicine , for the to know
these thynges , although I haue lytle leysure to do it , yet I wyl
endeuor my selfe to declare somwhat thereof . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.792

But if the swetenes of the versys or metyr of musycke , do delyght the
any thynge at all , thou must defer and put of a lytle that delyght ,
vntyll I shall forme certayne reasones ioyned in order , together for
that purpose . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.793

BOE: BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.795

I say do what it please the . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.797

PHIL. BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.799

<$$heading>

Then spake phylosophy thus as one that began to speake by another
principle . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.801

The generacion of all thynges , and the procedynges of natures
mutabilitie , and all other thynge that moueth now taketh their causes ,
order , and fourme by the stedfastnes of gods wyll and pleasure .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.802

And the same , that is to saye : goddes wyll and plesure , beyng set
fast in the towre , or profounde altitude of hys simplicitie or puritie
, hath appoynted many maners or wayes , for thynges to be done : whych
wayes or maners , when they be conceyued in the puritie of the dyuyne
intelligence , it is named prouidence or ordynaunce .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.803

But when the sayde maner or wayes is referred by men vnto the thynge
that mouethe and disposeth , it is called of olde folke , destinye .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.804

Whyche thynges , that is to say , prouidence and destenie , shal easely
appere to be contrary thynges , yf a man wyll well consyder in hys mynde
the strength of them both . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.805

For prouydence is the same deuyne or godly reason that is established in
the soueraine hygh prynce of al thynges , which godly reso~ diiposeth
and apointeth al things . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.806

But destinie is a disposicion , cleuyng vnto mutable or temporal thinges
, by which dispositio~ , prouide~ce knitteth al thinges in order .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.807

For prouide~ce embrasethe all thynges together in one , although they be
dyuers and infinite . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.808

But destynye deuydeth all thynges being distributed in mouing , places ,
formes , and tymes , as thus . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.809

Thys explycacion or declaracion of temporall order , that appertayneth
vnto destynye , being vnite or knytte together , in the syght of gods
thought , is called prouydence or ordynaunce .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.810

But the vniting of such ordynaunce temporall , beynge deuyded and shewed
in successyon of tymes , may be called destinie . Which destinie and
prouydence , althoughe they be dyuers , yet the one of them dependeth
vpon the other . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.811

For the order of destinie procedeth and commethe of the simplicitie or
puritie of gods prouidence . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,106.812

For lyke as a workeman conceyuing in his mynde the forme or fashyon of
the thyng that he is about to make , moueth and goeth aboute th@
@effecte of his worke , and ledeth by temporal or bodily ordynaunces
<P_107> the thing that he had conceyued symply and presently in his
thought , euen so certainelye god by his prouidence or ordinau~ce
disposeth and ordrythe singulerly and fyrmely al thynges that be to be
done . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.813

But he mynystreth dyuersly and temporally the same thynges by destynye
that he hath disposed or appoynted to be done .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.814

Then whether that destynye be exercised by certaine godly spyryts ,
attendyng vpon gods prouidence , or by the soule , or by nature , holye
seruyng god , or by the celestiall mouinge or constellacion of sterres ,
or by the vertue of Aungels , or by the dyuers craftes and soteltyes of
deuylles , or by anye of them , or by them all , the order of destinie
is accomplyshed and done . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.815

Certes it is manyfest that gods prouidence is a stedefast and symple or
pure forme or maner , of thynges to be done . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.816

But destinye , is a mutable disposition and temporall order of the
things that gods simplicitie or puritie hath appointed or suffered to be
done . Whereby it happeth that all thynges that be vnder or subiect to
destinie be also subiect and vnder gods prouidence and ordynaunce . To
the whyche prouidence or ordynaunce destinye is subiecte it selfe .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.817

But some thynges that be subiecte and put vnder godes prouidence , and
ordynaunces , doo excell and passe the order of destinye .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.818

Truely the thinges that be fixed and knyt faste nyghe to the godhed , do
excell the order of mouable destynie , BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.819

for as circles or wheles that do turne them selfe about one self centyr
or poynte , the innermost circle next vnto the centyr or poynt , cometh
and ioyneth next of al vnto that which is a_lone in the myddell ,
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.820

and is as it were a certayne centyr or pointe to the other circles or
wheles , that be set and placyd aboute , and be turned without the
centre or poynt . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.821

And the vttermost cyrcle that is turned wyth a greater compasse , is set
fourth with so muche more large spaces as it is distant by diuision from
the myddle of the centyr , or poynte . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.822

But yf there be any thinge that knyttethe and vnytethe it selfe , to the
same myddell centyr , or poynte , it is driuen into simplicitie , that
is to sai : into a thinge pure and alone of it self , constant and
immouable , BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.823

and ceasseth to be seperate or to go at libertye .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.824

And so by lyke reason the thynge that departeth or goeth awaye ferthest
from the fyrst thought of God , is wrapped with greater bandes of
destynye . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,107.825

And soo much more is any thyng fre from distinye , as it is nere the
same centyr , or poynte of thynges , that <P_108> is to saye nere vnto
god . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.826

And yf the thynge doo cleue firmely to the hygh thought of GOD without
mouing , truely it passeth the necessitie and power , of destinie .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.827

Therefore like comparison or diuersitie as is betwene reasonynge , and
vnderstandynge , and betwene the thinge engendred and the thynge that is
, and betwene tyme and eternitie , and betwene the circle , and the
middle centyr or poynt , euen so is the mouable order of destinye vnto
the stedefast simplicitie or puritie , or gods prouidence and ordynaunce
. BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.828

The same order of destenye moueth heuen and the sterres ,
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.829

and tempereth the elementes together emongest them self
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.830

and chau~geth them by enterchaungeable mutacions .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.831

And the same order of destinye renueth all thynges , growinge ,
springing and fallyng by lyke progressions of frutes and of sedes , that
is to saye , of all beastes and growing thinges .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.832

And thys order of destenye kepethe in and constraineth from liberty al
mens actes and fortunes by a band of causes that can not be vndone or
losed , which causes when they do procede from the immouable begynnynges
of gods prouidence and ordynaunces , it behoueth that they be immutable
. BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.833

And so al thinges be well gouerned , as longe as the simplicitie or the
onelye stedefastenes abydyng in the dyuine thought , sheweth fourth the
immouable order of causes . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.834

And truly this order of the deuine prouidence , kepeth in , by his
stedefastnes , thynges mutable of them selfe , and that otherwyse wold
passe awaye casually and rasshely , if that restrayned not : wherby it
happeth that although al thyngs seme confuse , darke , and troublesome
to you that be not able to consyder thys order of thinges : the proper
maner of gods prouidence directynge it selfe to good , disposeth and
ordereth all thyngs . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.835

For there is nothyng done for the entente of euil , not so muche of the
same wicked folke . Which wicked folke <paren> as it is shewed
aboundauntlye before <$$paren> do seke for good , but that wycked errour
do peruert , and turne them from it , BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.836

and not the order that cometh from the bosome of the high soueraign good
, that is god , do turne anye man from his begynnynge , that is to saye
from god . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.837

Certes what confusion may be more wycked , the~ {it_is_wicked} that
other whiles aduersitie and other whiles prosperite do happen vnto good
folke , and also to wycked folke sometyme what they desyre , and
sometyme the thynges that they hate and abhorre .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,108.838

Do men now liue in such perfection of mynde that suche folk as they do
iudge to be good or euil <P_109> must nedes be suche as they doo iudge
them ? BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.839

But mens iudgementes in this thynge do varye and not accorde .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.840

For the same folke that some me~ do esteme worthy reward , other agayne
do deme to be worthy of ponyshmente . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.841

But let vs graunt that some ma~ may discerne and knowe the good or the
euyl folke , BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.842

maye he than know and se the inward condicion of mans thoughte as it
hath bene wont to be sayd of the bodyes ? BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.843

That is to saye : maye a man knowe a mans thought , as men may knowe the
complexion or outward condicio~s of the bodye ?
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.844

Certes is not this lyke a myracle vnto a man that knowethe not , whye
that swete thynges agree well to hole folke , and bytter thinges to
sycke folk ? BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.845

Also why some sycke folk be heled with gentle medicines , and other sick
folke with sharp medicines . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.846

But the phisicion that knoweth bothe the maner and temperaunce of helthe
and syckenes , meruayleth not therat . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.847

But what other thynge semethe to be the helth of mens mindes and
thoughts , but onely vertue ? BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.848

and what other thynge semeth y=e= sicknes of mens myndes and thoughtes ,
then vyce and syns . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.849

Who els is the keper of good folk , and expulser or suppresser of wickyd
folke , but only god the ruler and the healer of mennes soules , whych
god , when he beholdeth and loketh downe from the high towre of his
prouidence , he knowethe what is conueniente and meete for euerye man ,
and geueth to euerye manne the thing that he knoweth is mete for him .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.850

Nowe hereof commethe thys notable myracle of the order of destinie ,
when that god <paren> that knoweth all thynges <$$paren> doeth the
thynge that the ignoraunte people do wonder at .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.851

For to speake a fewe thynges of the profounde depenes of the godhed that
mans resonne , may attayne vnto , the same man that thou demyst iust and
kepyng equitye , and ryght , semeth contrarye to Gods prouidence that
knoweth all thynges . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.852

And certes my familier felowe Lucan declareth , that the cause victorius
, plesyth the gods , and the cause that is ouercome pleaseth Plato .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.853

Therefore what soeuer thinge thou seist donne here in this world
contrary to the knowledge and expectacion of the ignoraunt folk , it is
the ryght order of thynges , BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.854

but to thy iudgement , it is a peruers confusion of thynges .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,109.855

But admyt that some man is so well learned or instructed , y=t= both
gods iugement , and ma~s iugement do agre in him together as one , but
yet y=t= he is weke_minded or harted , that yf any aduersitie by chaunce
happen vnto hym he wil@ @be clene turnyd from his vertue or innocensye ,
wherby he may not kepe <P_110> his fortune , BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.856

then the wise dispensacion or prouidence of God spareth hym , whome
aduersitie and trybulacion myghte empayre and make worse .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.857

And god wyll not suffer him to laboure that is not mete or able to
laboure . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.858

Another man is absolute perfit in al vertues , holy and nere vnto god ,
so that gods prouidence woulde deme it wronge y=t= he shulde be touched
with any aduersitie , in_so_much that he will not suffer him to be vexed
w=c= any infyrmitie or sycknes of the body . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.859

For as a certayne phylosopher <paren> more excellente by me <$$paren>
hath sayde : certes a true preistly man laboreth not ,
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.860

for vertues haue preserued the body of an holy ma~ from aduersitie .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.861

And often tymes it happith that the cheyf thynges y=t= be to be done ,
be geuen vnto good folke , that the wyckednes aboundyng in euyl folke ,
shold be oppressid . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.862

And god dystributeth and geueth to some folke nowe good , nowe euyll
thinges , accordyng to the qualitie of theyr mind .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.863

And some good folke he greueth with aduersitie , leste that they should
waxe proude , of long prosperitie . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.864

And other folke he sufferethe to be vexed with harde thynges , that
thereby they may confyrme the vertues of their mynde , by the vse and
exercyse of pacience . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.865

Some folke doo feare more then they ought to feare , y=e= thing that
they maye well suffer . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.866

And other dispisethe more then they oughte , the thyng that they can@
@not suffer , BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.867

and god ledethe them into experience of them selfe ,
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.868

that is to saye : makethe them to knowe themselfe by aduersities .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.869

And manye haue optayned a worshypfull fame of thys worlde by the meanes
of a glorious deth . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.870

And some that coulde not be ouercome by ponishment , haue shewed example
vnto other , that vertue can@ @not be ouercome by aduersitie .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.871

And there {SIC:therc} is no dout but that all these thynges be done
ryghtfully , and ordytely , for the goodnes of them , for whome they
seme to happen . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.872

For certes where as sometyme aduersities , and otherwhiles thinges
desired , doo happen vnto wycked folke , noo man meruayleth therat ,
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.873

but iudgeth that it comethe of the causes thereof , that is to saye ,
for theyr wyckednes . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.874

Lykewyse of the ponyshmentes that happen vnto wycked folke no man
meruaylethe , BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.875

for all men doo thynke that they haue well deserued the same , and that
theyr ponyshmentes doth as@ @well feare other from wyckednes , as
causeth them to amend that be ponyshed . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,110.876

And the prosperitie that happen vnto wycked folke in worldly goodes
sheweth a great argument and proufe vnto good folke , what they ought to
iudge of such <P_111> prosperitie whych men doo se often tyme serue y
wycked folke . In whych thing I thynke also the same to be ordeyned by
god , that some mans nature is perchaunce so ouerturnyng and importunate
vnto wyckednes , that the pouertie of his houshold may rather prouoke
hym to stele , whose pouertie that goodnes of god cureth and releueth ,
wyth the medycyne or remedy of mony , and ryches .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.877

And another man perceyuing his owne conscience corrupt with wickednes ,
and consyderynge wyth hym selfe his prosperitie and welth , ferethe
leste perchaunce the losse of the same prosperitie whiche is pleasaunt
vnto hym , should turne hym to sorowe and heuines ,
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.878

and therfore he wyl chaunge his euyll maners and conditions , and
forsake his wyckednes , for fear to lose hys prosperitie and riches .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.879

Prosperitie and ryches vnworthelye gotten hathe ouer_throwen other into
iust destruction accordelye . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.880

Some be permytted to haue power to ponysh , for that it shuld be an
occasion of continuaunce of exercyse in vertue to good folke , and a
ponyshment to the wycked folke . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.881

For as there is no concorde or argumente betwene good folke and wycked
folke , euen so the wycked folke can@ @not agre emongest them selfe .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.882

And why not ? BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.883

For all wycked folke do vary of them selfe by theyr wyckednes , that
rendith their conscience , BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.884

and doo often tymes suche thynges , that when they haue done , they
themself do iudge that they oughte not to haue bene done . For whyche
cause that hye prouydence of god , hath often shewed a gret myracle so
that wycked folke , hath made wycked folke good folke .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.885

For when that some wycked folke do se that they suffer wronges of the
wicked , they being moued with enuy and hatred of theyr wronges and
hurtes , haue returnyd vnto the fruyte of vertue , that is to sai vnto
goodnes , when they do studye to be vnlyke vnto the wicked whom they
haue hated . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.886

Truely it is onely the power of god <paren> to whome also euyll thyngs
be good <$$paren> when he in vsynge of those euyles , choseth oute th@
@effecte of some goodnes , that is to say , when god turneth euyll to
good . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.887

For order bindeth together all thynges , soo that what thyng departeth
from the reson and order appointed to the wycked , the same thing must
nedes fall into some other order , that is to saye : of the good , soo
that nothinge be lefte to folyshnes , or oute of order in the kyngdome
of gods prouidence or ordynaunce . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,111.888

The strong god hath done al thyngs in the world , when he sawe and
behelde <P_112> before all worldes . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,112.889

And certes it is not lawfull for men eyther to comprehende with their
wit , or to declare with ther spech all the causes of gods workes :
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,112.890

It is sufficient only to behold thys that the same God , the maker of
all natures , ordaynyng all things , disposeth them to good .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,112.891

And whyles that he hastethe to retayne and kepe the thynges that he hath
made into his similytude and lykenes , that is to saye : in goodnes , he
excludeth all wyckednes from the bondes of hys commenaltye of thys world
, by order of necessite of destenie : whereby it happeth , that the euyl
that men do thynke to abound in the world if thou considerest Gods
prouidence , that disposeth all thynges , thou shalte perceyue that
there is no euyll at all any where . BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,112.892

But I se well nowe , that thou being of late sore burdned , w=c= the
wayte of thys difficulte question , and also weryed with the prolixitie
or length of my reason , lokest for som swetenes of verses or metyr .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,112.893

Therfore take thys drafte , whereby when thou arte refreshed , and
stronger , thou mayst ascende into hier questions .
BOETHCO-1556-E1-H,112.894
