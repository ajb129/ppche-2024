<P_IV,113C2>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou had'st need to know it very well ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.3

for it seems thou wentest without a Candle or any thing in the World ,
and put in thy Horse . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.4

Did'st thou see that Man <font> Carpenter <$$font> the Bailiff that thou
spokest of ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.5

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Mr. <font> Carpenter <$$font> gave my Horse
Hay . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.6

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was there any Light in the Stable ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.7

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Not when I put in my Horse first .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.8

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who brought the Light thither ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.9

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Goodman <font> Carpenter <$$font> .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.10

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not he give thy Horse Hay ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.11

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Yes , he did . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.12

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And did he not give him Oats too ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.13

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , he did not .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.14

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not he conduct you into the House ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.15

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Who , my Lord ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.16

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That same Goodman <font> Carpenter <$$font>
. LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.17

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.18

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you see any body else but that Girl you
speak of ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.19

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I did see the Girl there .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.20

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But you Blockhead , I ask you whether you
did see any body else ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.21

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I do not know but I might see Goodman <font>
Carpenter <$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,113C2.22

<P_IV,114C1>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why , thou said'st he brought the Light ,
and gave thy Horse Hay ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.24

but I see thou art set upon nothing but Prevarication :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.25

Sirrah , tell me plainly , did you see no body else ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.26

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.27

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Not any body ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.28

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , not any one .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.29

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you not drink in the House ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.30

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , not a Drop .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.31

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not you call for Drink ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.32

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , I did not ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.33

I had nothing but my Cake and Cheese that I brought thither my self .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.34

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who went up to the Chamber with you ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.35

<font> Dunne . <$$font> The Girl , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.36

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And no body else ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.37

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.38

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was the Bed made ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.39

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Yes , my Lord , it was .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.40

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You eat nothing in the House , you say ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.41

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Nothing but my own Cake and Cheese , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.42

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But you did not drink in the House at all ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.43

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , I did not .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.44

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you drink at <font> Marton <$$font> ,
where you did call upon <font> Fane <$$font> .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.45

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Yes , I did , but not afterwards .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.46

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you see any body there the next Morning
before they were taken ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.47

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.48

but after the House was beset , I saw my Lady and Mr. <font> Hicks
<$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.49

and I think I saw Goodman <font> Carpenter <$$font> .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.50

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> They and you were taken there together ,
were not you ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.51

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Yes . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.52

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you see <font> Carpenter's <$$font> Wife
, upon your Oath , that Night ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.53

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I did not .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.54

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nor no Woman-kind besides the Girl you speak
of ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.55

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.56

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nor no Man besides <font> Carpenter <$$font>
? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.57

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.58

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You are sure of this ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.59

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I am so , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.60

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You are sure you did not drink there ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.61

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I am , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.62

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And you say he brought the Light into the
Stable , and gave your Horse Hay ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.63

<font> Dunne . <$$font> He did , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.64

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Now pri@ @thee tell me truly , where came
<font> Carpenter <$$font> unto you ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.65

I must know the Truth of that ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.66

remember that I gave you fair Warning , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.67

do not tell me a Lye , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.68

for I will be sure to treasure up every Lye that thou tellest me ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.69

and thou may'st be certain it will not be for thy Advantage :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.70

I would not terrify thee to make thee say any thing but the Truth :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.71

but assure thy self I never met with a lying , sneaking , canting Fellow
, but I always treasur'd up Vengeance for him :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.72

and therefore look to it , that thou dost not prevaricate with me ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.73

for to be sure thou wilt come to the worst of it in the end ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.74

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I will tell the Truth as near as I
can . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.75

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then tell me where <font> Carpenter <$$font>
met thee ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.76

<font> Dunne . <$$font> In the Court , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.77

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Before you came to the Gate , or after ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.78

<font> Dunne . <$$font> It was after we came to the Gate , in the Court
. LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C1.79

<P_IV,114C2>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then tell me , and I charge you tell me true
, who was with you when <font> Carpenter <$$font> met you ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.81

<font> Dunne . <$$font> <font> Hicks <$$font> and <font> Nelthorp
<$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.82

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was there any body else besides them two in
the Court ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.83

<font> Dunne . <$$font> There was no body but <font> Hicks <$$font> and
<font> Nelthorp <$$font> , and I and Mr. <font> Carpenter <$$font> .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.84

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You are sure of that ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.85

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Yes , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.86

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Consider of it , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.87

are you sure there was no body else ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.88

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Truly , my Lord , I did not mind that there was
any body else . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.89

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Recollect your self ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.90

and consider well of it . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.91

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Truly , my Lord , I do not know of any body
else . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.92

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Now upon your Oath tell me truly , who it
was that opened the Stable-door , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.93

was it <font> Carpenter <$$font> or you ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.94

<font> Dunne . <$$font> It was <font> Carpenter <$$font> , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.95

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why , thou vile Wretch didst not thou tell
me just now that thou pluck'd up the Latch ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.96

Dost thou take the God of Heaven not to be a God of Truth , and that he
is not a Witness of all thou say'st ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.97

Dost thou think because thou prevaricatest with the Court here , thou
can'st do so with God above , who knows thy Thoughts ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.98

and it is infinite Mercy , that for those Falshoods of thine , he does
not immediately strike thee into Hell ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.99

Jesus God ! LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.100

there is no sort of Conversation nor human Society to be kept with such
People as these are , who have no other Religion but only in Pretence ,
and no way to uphold themselves but by countenancing Lying and Villany :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.101

Did not you tell me that you opened the Latch your self , and that you
saw no body else but a Girl ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.102

How durst you offer to tell such horrid Lyes in the presence of God and
of a Court of Justice ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.103

Answer me one Question more : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.104

Did he pull down the Hay or you ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.105

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I did not pull down any Hay at all .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.106

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was there any Hay pull'd down before the
Candle was brought ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.107

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , there was not .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.108

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who brought the Candle ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.109

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Mr. <font> Carpenter <$$font> brought the
Candle and Lanthorn . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.110

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> It seems the Saints have a certain Charter
for Lying ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.111

they may lye and cant , and deceive , and rebel , and think God Almighty
takes no notice of it , nor will reckon with them for it :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.112

You see , Gentlemen , what a precious Fellow this is , a very pretty
Tool to be employ'd upon such an Errand , a Knave that no body would
trust for half a Crown between Man and Man ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.113

but he is the fitter to be employ'd about such Works ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.114

what Pains is a Man at to get the Truth out of these Fellows ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.115

and it is with a great deal of Labour , that we can squeeze one Drop out
of them ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.116

A <font> Turk <$$font> has more Title to an Eternity of Bliss than these
Pretenders to Christianity , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.117

for he has more Morality and Honesty in him .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.118

Sirrah , I charge you in the presence of God , tell me true , What other
Persons did you see that Night ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.119

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I did not see any than what I have
told you already . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.120

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then they went out
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.121

and brought word that thou wert come , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.122

and so he came out to meet thee . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.123

Very well : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,114C2.124

I would have every body that has but the least Tang of Saintship to
observe the Carriage of this Fellow , and see how they can cant and
snivel , and lye , and forswear themselves , and all for <P_IV,115C1>
the Good Old Cause : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.125

They will stick at nothing , if they think they can but preserve a
Brother or Sister Saint forsooth ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.126

they can do any thing in the world but speak Truth , and do their Duty
to God and their Governours : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.127

I ask you again , Did not <font> Carpenter <$$font> meet you before you
left <font> Hicks <$$font> and <font> Nelthorp <$$font> ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.128

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , he did not . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.129

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then I ask you again once more , did not
<font> Carpenter <$$font> ask you to drink ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.130

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , he did not . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.131

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not he light you with a Lanthorn and
Candle into the House ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.132

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I went into the House .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.133

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou believe we think any body thrust
thee in : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.134

Did he light thee in , I ask thee ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.135

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I went in along with Mr. <font> Carpenter
<$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.136

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Room did he carry you into ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.137

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , he carried me into no Room ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.138

the young Woman shew'd me into a Room . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.139

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Room was it ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.140

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Into the Chamber .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.141

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was not thou in the Hall or Kitchen ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.142

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.143

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> It is hard thou hadst not one Cup of Drink
to thy Cake and Cheese . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.144

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I had never a Drop .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.145

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No , nor did no body ask you to eat or drink
? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.146

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.147

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou art the best-natur'd Fellow that ever I
met with , but the worst rewarded . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.148

Come , I will ask thee another Question : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.149

When was the first time thou heard'st <font> Nelthorp's <$$font> Name ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.150

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Not till he was taken .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.151

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Name did the Fellow with the black
Beard tell thee he had ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.152

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , he never told me any Name ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.153

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Didst thou never ask him his Name ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.154

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , that Man that was afterwards
found to be <font> Nelthorp <$$font> , I did not know to be <font>
Nelthorp <$$font> till he was taken , nor what his Name was , nor any
Name he had . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.155

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No , pri@ @thee tell the Truth ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.156

did not <font> Nelthorp <$$font> go by the Name of <font> Crofts
<$$font> ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.157

<font> Dunne . <$$font> He did , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.158

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then pri@ @thee , when did he first go by
that Name in thy Hearing ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.159

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I only heard <font> Hicks <$$font>
say he went by the Name of <font> Crofts <$$font> .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.160

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> When was that ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.161

<font> Dunne . <$$font> When they were taken .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.162

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you not hear him call'd by that Name any
time of the Journey ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.163

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I can@ @not recollect , my Lord , that I ever
did . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.164

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou canst recollect nothing of Truth :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.165

Is this as much as you can say ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.166

<font> Dunne . <$$font> It is , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.167

Mr. <font> Jennings . <$$font> You say <font> Carpenter <$$font> met
you very civilly , and took care of your Horse :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.168

Did he make no Provision for <font> Hicks <$$font> and <font> Nelthorp's
<$$font> Horses ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.169

What became of them ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.170

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I can@ @not tell , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.171

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou art a strange prevaricating , shuffling
, sniveling , lying Rascal . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,115C1.178

<P_IV,115C2>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No , God forbid , Mrs. <font> Lisle

LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,120C1.187

you know very well what I mean : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,120C1.188

the King's Courts of Law never condemn without hearing .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,120C1.190

LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,120C1.191

Gate ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,120C1.199

she said , she knew nothing of any body being in the House -
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,120C1.203

and stole away a great part of my best Linen ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,120C1.205

and sure , my Lord , those Persons that rob me , are not fit to be
Evidences against me , because it behoves them that I be convicted , to
prevent their being indicted for Felony . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,120C1.206

and , as I remember , there was a Letter produced .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.312

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou should'st not be angry with him ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.313

Mr. <font> Carpenter . <$$font> That , my Lord , I acknowledge .

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then , pri@ @thee let me ask thee another
Question : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.316

Did you carry any Beer up into the Room ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.317

Mr. <font> Carpenter . <$$font> My Lady gave order for the Provision .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.318

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you make <font> Dunne <$$font> drink ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.319

Mr. <font> Carpenter . <$$font> No , I did not .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.320

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you offer him any Drink ?

Mr. <font> Carpenter . <$$font> My Lord , I did not see him drink at
all . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.322

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What say you , good Woman ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.323

Did not your Lady sup there ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.324

Mr. <font> Carpenter . <$$font> My Lord , my Wife was little there at
all ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.325

Mr. <font> Rumsey . <$$font> Now , my Lord , <font> Dunne <$$font>
says he will tell all , whether it make for him or against him .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.326

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Let him but tell the Truth , and I am
satisfied . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.327

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Sure , my Lord , I never entertained these Men
a night in my House in my Life ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.328

but this <font> Hicks <$$font> sent that Man to me , to go to my Lady
<font> Lisle@ @'s <$$font> , to know whether she would please to
entertain him : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.329

And when I came , my Lady asked me , whether he had been in the Army or
no ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.330

I told her , I could not tell , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.331

I did not know that he was . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.332

She then ask'd me , if he had no body else with him ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.333

I told her , I believed there was : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.334

This is the very Truth of it , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.335

I asked her , might the Men be entertain'd ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.336

She said they might . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.337

So when we came to my Lady <font> Lisle's @'s <$$font> , on the <font>
Tuesday <$$font> night , somebody took the two Horses ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.338

I can@ @not tell who , if I were to die ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.339

the two went in ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.340

and after I had set up my Horse , I went in along with <font> Carpenter
<$$font> up into the Chamber to my Lady , and to this <font> Hicks
<$$font> and <font> Nelthorp <$$font> ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.341

and when I came there , I heard my Lady bid them welcome to her House ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C1.342

and Mr. <font> Carpenter <$$font> , <P_IV,121C2> or the Maid , I can@
@not tell which , brought in the Supper , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.343

and set it on the Table . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.344

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And did'st thou eat or drink with 'em in the
Room , or not ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.345

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I will tell every thing that I know ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.346

I confess I did both eat and drink there in the Room .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.347

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I pity thee with all my Soul ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.348

and pray to God Almighty for thee to forgive thee , and to the blessed
Jesus to mediate for thee ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.349

and I pray for thee with as much earnestness , as I would for my own
Soul ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.350

and I beg of thee once more , as thou regardest thy own eternal Welfare
, to tell all the Truth . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.351

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I did never know these Men were in
the Army when I carried the Message to my Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s
<$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.352

nor never did entertain them in my House in my life-time , so much as
one Night . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.353

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pri@ @thee , I do not ask thee what thou
did'st not , but what thou did'st ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.354

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I will tell all I know .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.355

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Discourse had you that Night at the
Table in the Room ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.356

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I can@ @not tell what Discourse truly , my Lord
, there was . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.357

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was there nothing of coming from beyond Seas
, who came from thence , and how they came ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.358

Come , I would have it rather the Effect of thy own Ingenuity , than
lead thee by any Questions that I can propound ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.359

come , tell us what was the Discourse . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.360

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I do not remember all the Discourse .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.361

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pri@ @thee , let me ask thee one Question ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.362

and answer me it fairly ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.363

Did'st not thou hear <font> Nelthorp's <$$font> Name named in the Room ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.364

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I can@ @not tell whether he were
called <font> Nelthorp <$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.365

but it was either <font> Crofts <$$font> or <font> Nelthorp <$$font> ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.366

I am sure one of them . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.367

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pri@ @thee be ingenuous ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.368

and let@ @'s have the Truth on@ @'t ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.369

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I am ingenuous ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.370

and will be so . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.371

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I will assure you , <font> Nelthorp <$$font>
told me all the Story before I came out of Town ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.372

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I think , my Lord , he was called <font>
Nelthorp <$$font> in the Room , and there was some Discourse about him .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.373

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay , there was unquestionably ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.374

and I know thou wert by , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.375

and that made me the more concern'd to press upon thee the Danger of
forswearing thy self . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.376

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lady ask'd <font> Hicks <$$font> who that
Gentleman was , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.377

and he said it was <font> Nelthorp <$$font> , as I remember .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.378

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Very well , and upon that Discourse with
<font> Nelthorp <$$font> , which I had in Town , did I give particular
Direction , that the Outlawry of <font> Nelthorp <$$font> should be
brought down hither , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.379

for he told me particularly of all the Passages and Discourses of his
being beyond Sea , and coming from beyond Sea :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.380

I would not mention any such thing as any piece of Evidence to influence
this case , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.381

but I could not but tremble to think , after what I knew , that any one
should dare so much to prevaricate with God and Man , as to tell such
horrid Lyes in the Face of a Court . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.382

<font> Dunne . <$$font> What does your Lordship ask me ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.383

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Come , I will ask thee a plain Question ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.384

Was there no Discourse there about the Battle , and of their being in
the Army ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.385

<font> Dunne . <$$font> There was some such Discourse , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,121C2.386

<P_IV,122C1>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay , pri@ @thee now tell us what that
Discourse was ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.388

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I will tell you when I have
re-collected it , if you will give me time till to-morrow Morning .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.389

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nay , but we can@ @not stay so long ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.390

our Business must be dispatched now ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.391

but I would have all People consider what a Reason there is , that they
should be pressed to join with me in hearty Prayers to Almighty God ,
that this Sin of Lying and Perjury may never be laid at thy door .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.392

What say'st thou ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.393

Pri@ @thee tell us what the Discourse was ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.394

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , they did talk of Fighting ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.395

but I can@ @not exactly tell what the Discourse was ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.396

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And thou said'st thou did'st eat and drink
with them in the same Room ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.397

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I did so , my Lord ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.398

I confess it . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.399

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And it was not a little Girl that lighted
thee to Bed , or conducted thee in ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.400

<font> Dunne . <$$font> It was not a little Girl .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.401

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who was it then ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.402

<font> Dunne . <$$font> It was Mr. <font> Carpenter <$$font> , my Lord
. LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.403

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And why did'st thou tell so many Lyes then ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.404

Jesu God ! that we should live to see any such Creatures among Mankind
, nay , and among us too , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.405

to the Shame and Reproach be it spoken of our Nation and Religion :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.406

Is this that that is called the Protestant Religion , a thing so much
boasted of , and pretended to ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.407

We have heard a great deal of Clamour against Popery and Dispensations ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.408

what Dispensations pray does the Protestant Religion give for such
Practices as these ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.409

I pity thee with all my Soul , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.410

and pray for thee , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.411

but it can@ @not but make all Mankind to tremble and be filled with
Horror , that such a wretched Creature should live upon the Earth :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.412

Pri@ @thee be free , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.413

and tell us what Discourse there was ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.414

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , they did talk of Fighting ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.415

but I can@ @not remember what it was . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.416

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you lie with them ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.417

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , I did not .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.418

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , I see thou wilt answer nothing
ingenuously , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.419

therefore I will trouble my self no more with thee :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.420

Go on with your Evidence , Gentlemen . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.421

Mr. <font> Jennings . <$$font> My Lord , we have done ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.422

we have no more Witnesses . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.423

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then you that are for the Prisoner at the
Bar , now is your time to make your Defence ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.424

you hear what is charged upon you , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.425

and you see what a kind of Shuffling here has been to stifle the Truth ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.426

and I am sorry to find the Occasion to speak it , that under the Figure
and Form of Religion such Practices should be carried on .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.427

What have you to say for your self ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.428

<font> Lisle . <$$font> My Lord , that which I have to say to it , is
this : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.429

I knew of no body's coming to my House but Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font> ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.430

and for him I was inform'd that he did abscond , by reason of Warrants
that were out against him for preaching in private Meetings ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.431

but I never heard that he was in the Army , nor that <font> Nelthorp
<$$font> was to come with him ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.432

and for that Reason it was , that I sent to him to come by night :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.433

but for the other Man <font> Nelthorp <$$font> , I never knew he was
<font> Nelthorp <$$font> , I could die upon it ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.434

nor did not know what Name he had , till after he came into my House ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.435

but as for Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font> , I did not in the least suspect
him to have been in the Army , being a Presbyterian Minister , that used
to preach , and not to fight . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C1.436

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But I will tell you , there is not one of
those lying , sniveling , canting , Presbyterian Rascals , but one way
or other had a hand in the late <P_IV,122C2> horrid Conspiracy and
Rebellion ; upon my Conscience I believe it , and would have been as
deep in the actual Rebellion , had it had any little Success , as that
other Fellow <font> Hicks <$$font> ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.437

their Principles carry them to it : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.438

Presbytery has all manner of Villainy in it ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.439

nothing but Presbytery could lead that Fellow <font> Dunne <$$font> to
tell so many Lyes as he has here told ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.440

for shew me a Presbyterian , and I will engage to shew a lying Knave .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.441

<font> Lisle . <$$font My Lord , I abhorred both the Principles and
Practices of the late Rebellion . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.442

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I am sure you had great reason for it .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.443

<font> Lisle . <$$font Besides , my Lord , I should have been the most
ungrateful Person living , should I have been disloyal , or acted any
thing against the present King , considering how much I was obliged to
him for my Estate . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.444

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Oh then ! LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.445

Ungrateful , ungrateful adds to the Load which is between Man and Man ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.446

and is the basest Crime that any one can be guilty of .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.447

<font> Lisle . <$$font My Lord , had I been try'd in <font> London
<$$font> , I could have had my Lady <font> Abergavenny <$$font> , and
several other Persons of Quality , that could have testified how much I
was against this Rebellion , and with what Detestation I spoke against
it , during the time of it ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.448

for I was all that time at <font> London <$$font> ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.449

and staid there till after the Duke of <font> Monmouth <$$font> was
beheaded ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.450

and if I had certainly known the time of my Trial in the Country , I
could have had the Testimony of those Persons of Honour for me .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.451

But , my Lord , I am told , and so I thought it would have been , that I
should not have been try'd as a Traitor for harbouring him , till he was
Convict for a Traitor . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.452

My Lord , I would take my Death of it , that I never knew of <font>
Nelthorp's <$$font> coming , nor any thing of his being <font> Nelthorp
<$$font> ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.453

I never ask'd his Name , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.454

and if he had told it me , I had then remember'd the Proclamation .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.455

I do assure you , my Lord , for my own part , I did abhor those that
were in that horrid Plot and Conspiracy against the King's Life ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.456

I know my Duty to my King better , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.457

and have always exercised it , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.458

I defy any body in the world that ever knew the contrary , to come and
give Testimony . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.459

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Have you any more to say ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.460

<font> Lisle . <$$font As to what they say of my denying <font>
Nelthorp <$$font> to be in my House , I was in great Consternation and
Fear of the Soldiers , who were very rude and violent , and could not be
restrained by their Officers from Robbery , and plundering my House .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.461

And I beseech your Lordship to make that Construction of it ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.462

and I humbly beg of your Lordship not to harbour an ill Opinion of me ,
because of those false Reports that go about of me , relating to my
Carriage towards the old King , that I was any ways consenting to the
Death of King <font> Charles <$$font> I. LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.463

for , my Lord , that is as false as God is true ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.464

my Lord , I was not out of my Chamber all the day , in which that King
was beheaded , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.465

and I believe I shed more Tears for him , than any Woman then living did
; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.466

and this the late Countess of <font> Monmouth <$$font> , and my Lady
<font> Marlborough <$$font> , and my Lord Chancellor <font> Hyde
<$$font> , if they were alive , and twenty Persons of the most eminent
Quality , could bear witness for me . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.467

And I do repeat it , my Lord , as I hope to attain Salvation , I never
did know <font> Nelthrop <$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.468

nor never did see him before in my Life , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.469

nor did I know of any body's coming , but Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font> ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.470

and him I did know to be a Nonconformist Minister ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.471

and there being , as is well known , Warrants out to apprehend all
Nonconformist Ministers , I was willing to give him shelter from these
Warrants . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,122C2.472

I <P_IV,123C1> was come down but that Week into the Country , when this
Man came to me from Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font> , to know if he might be
receiv'd at my House ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.473

and I told him , if Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font> pleas'd , he might come
upon <font> Tuesday <$$font> in the Evening , and should be welcome ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.474

but withal I told him , I must go away the <font> Monday <$$font>
following from that place , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.475

but while I staid I would entertain him . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.476

And I beseech your Lordship to believe , I had no intention to harbour
him but as a Nonconformist , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.477

and that I knew was no Treason : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.478

It can@ @not be imagined , that I would venture the hazard of my own
Life , and the Ruin both of myself and Children , to conceal one that I
never knew in my Life , as I did not know Mr. <font> Nelthorp <$$font>
, but had heard of him in the Proclamation .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.479

And for that white-headed Man that speaks of my denying them , as I said
before , he was one of them that rifled and plunder'd my House , and
tore open my Trunk ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.480

and if I should not be convicted , he and the rest of them may be call'd
to account for what they did , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.481

for they ought not to have meddled with my Goods :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.482

Besides , my Lord , I have a Witness that can testify what Mr. <font>
Nelthorp <$$font> said , when he was examined before -
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.483

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Look you , Mrs. <font> Lisle <$$font> ,
that will signify little ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.484

but if you have any Witnesses , call them , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.485

we will hear what they say : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.486

Who is that Man you speak of ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.487

<font> Lisle . <$$font <font> George Creed <$$font> his Name is ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.488

there he is . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.489

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , what do you know ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.490

<font> Creed . <$$font> I heard <font> Nelthorp <$$font> say , that my
Lady <font> Lisle <$$font> did not know of his coming , nor did not know
his Name ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.491

nor had he ever told his name , till he named himself to Col. <font>
Penruddock <$$font> when he was taken . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.492

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , this is nothing ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.493

she is not indicted for harbouring <font> Nelthorp <$$font> , but <font>
Hicks <$$font> : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.494

Have you any more Witnesses ? LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.495

<font> Lisle . <$$font No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.496

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Have you any more to say for yourself ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.497

<font> Lisle . <$$font My Lord , I came but five days before this into
the Country - LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.498

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nay , I can@ @not tell when you came into
the Country , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.499

nor I do not care ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.500

it seems you came time enough to harbour Rebels .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.501

<font> Lisle . <$$font I staid in <font> London <$$font> till all the
Rebellion was past and over ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.502

and I never uttered a good Word for the Rebels ,
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.503

nor ever harbour'd so much as a good Wish for them in my Mind :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.504

I know the King is my Sovereign , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.505

and I know my Duty to him , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.506

and if I would have ventured my Life for any thing , it should have been
to serve him , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.507

I know it is his due , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.508

and I owed all I had in the World to him : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.509

But tho' I could not fight for him my self , my Son did ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.510

he was actually in Arms on the King's side in this Business ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.511

I instructed him always in Loyalty , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.512

and sent him thither ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.513

it was I that bred him up to fight for the King .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.514

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , have you done ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.515

<font> Lisle . <$$font Yes , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.516

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Have you a mind to say any thing more ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.517

<font> Lisle . <$$font No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.518

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then command Silence .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.519

<font> Which was done by Proclamation . <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.520

<font> Lisle . <$$font My Lord , may I speak one word more ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.521

My Lord , I beseech you afford me your Patience and your Advice ;
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.522

<font> Keinsham <$$font> , where Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font> is said to
be in Arms , does not lie in this County . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C1.523

<P_IV,123C2>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That is nothing :
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C2.525

But the Treason you committed was in this County .
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C2.526

<font> Lisle . <$$font But I assure your Lordship I never knew he was
in the Army ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C2.527

and for any Talk or Discourse in private about his or <font> Nelthorp's
<$$font> being there , I never heard any : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C2.528

indeed one of them asked me , whether the Duke of <font> Monmouth
<$$font> was beheaded ; LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C2.529

and I told them , yes , LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C2.530

for so he was before I came out of Town : LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C2.531

And that is all the Discourse that I can remember , wherein he is
concerned . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C2.532

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , have you any more to say now ?
LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C2.533

<font> Lisle . <$$font No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-H,IV,123C2.534
