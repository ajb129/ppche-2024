<font> Shrewsbury . <$$font> Come you hither to checke us <font>
Throckmorton <$$font> ; we will not be so used ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,63.C1.30

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Yea , my good Lord , I know it right

I meant not to touche your Lordship , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,63.C1.33

and you would teach us our Duties ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,63.C1.37

and so I satisfie my selfe , since I shall not speake , thinking you all

THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,63.C1.43

THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.44

and do pleade not giltie to the whole , and to euery part thereof .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.45

<font> Sendall . <$$font> How wilt thou be tried ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.46

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Shall I be tried as I would , or as I
shuld ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.47

<font> Bromley . <$$font> You shall be tried as the Law will ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.48

and therefore you must say by God and by the Countrey .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.49

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Is that your Law for me ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.50

it is not as I wold ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.51

but since you wil have it so , I am pleased with it ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.52

and do desire to be tried by faithful just Men , which more fear God
than the World . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.53

The Names of the Jurours . <font> Lucas . Lowe . Yong . Whetston .
Martyn . Pointer . Beswike . Bankes . Bascafeeld . Calthrop .
Kightley . Cater . <$$font> THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.54

What time the Atturney went forthwith to Mr. <font> Cholmley <$$font> ,
and shewed him the Sheriffes Returne , who being acquainted with the
Citizens , knowing the Corruptions and Dexterities of them in such Cases
, noted certaine to be chalenged for the Q. <paren> a rare case
<$$paren> THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.55

and the same Men being knowen to be sufficient and indifferent , that no
Exceptions were to be taken to them , but only for their upright
Honesties , notwithstanding the Attorney prompting Sergeant <font> Dier
<$$font> . The said Sergeant chalenged one <font> Bacon <$$font> , and
another Citizen peremptorily for the Queen .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.56

Then the Prisoner demanded the cause of the Chalenge :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.57

the Sergeante aunswered , we neede not shew you the cause of the
Chalenge for the Queen . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.58

Then the Inquest was furnished with other honest Men , that is to say ,
<font> Whetstone <$$font> and <font> Lucas <$$font> ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.59

so the Prisoner vsed these Words . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.60

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I trust you have not provided for me
this Day , as in times past I knew another Gentleman occupying this
woful place was prouided for . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.61

It chanced one of the Justices upon Jealousie of the Prisoner's
acquitall , for the goodnesse of his Cause , said to another of his
Companions a Justice , when the Jury did appeare , I like not this Jury
for our purpose , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.62

they seeme to be too pitiful and too charitable to condemne the Prisoner
. THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.63

No , no , said the other Judge <font> viz. Cholmley <$$font> I warrant
you , they be picked Fellowes for the nonce ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.64

he shall drink of the same Cup his Fellowes haue done .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.65

I was then a loker on of the Pageant as others be now here ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.66

but now wo is me , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.67

I am a Player in that woful Tragedie . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.68

Well , for these and such other like the black Oxe hath of late troden
on some of their Feet , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.69

but my trust is , I shall not be so used . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.70

Whylest this Talke was , <font> Cholmeley <$$font> consulted with the
Atturney aboute the Jury , which the Prisoner espied , and then sayde as
heere ensueth , Ah , ah Maister <font> Cholmely <$$font> , will this
foule packing neuer be left ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.71

<font> Cholmely . <$$font> Why what do I , I pray you , M. <font>
Throckmorton <$$font> ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.72

I did nothing , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.73

I am sure you do picke Quarrels to me . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.74

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Well Maister <font> Cholmely <$$font> ,
if you do well , it is better for you , God help you .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.75

The Jury then was sworne , and Proclamation made , that whosoeuer woulde
giue Euidence againste Sir <font> Nicholas Throckmorton <$$font> Knight
, shoulde come in and be heard , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,64.C2.76

for the Prisoner stood upon <P_I,65.C1> his Deliuerance : whereupon
Sergeant <font> Stanford <$$font> presented hymself to speake .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.77

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> And it may please you Maister Sergeante
, and the others my Masters of the Quenes learned Counsell , like as I
was minded to haue said a fewe Words to the Commissioners , if I mighte
haue had leaue , for their better remembrance of their Dueties in this
place of Justice , and concerning direct indifferency to be used towards
me this Day ; so by your Patience I do thinke good to say somewhat to
you , and to the rest of the Quenes learned Counsell , appointed to giue
Euidence againste mee . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.78

And albeit you and the rest by Order be appointed to gyue euidence
againste mee , and enterteyned to sette forth the Depositions and Matter
against me , yet I pray you remember I am not alienate from you , but
that I am youre Christian Brother , neither you so charged , but you
ought to consider Equitie , nor yet so priuiledged , but that you haue a
Duetie of God appoynted you how you shal do youre Office , whiche if you
exceede , wil be greuously required at youre hands .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.79

It is lawfull for you to vse your Gifts , which I know God hathe largely
giuen you , as youre Learning , Arte and Eloquence , so as thereby you
do not seduce the Minds of the simple and unlearned Jury , to credite
Matters otherwise than they be . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.80

For Maister Sergeant , I knowe howe by Perswasions , Enforcements ,
Presumptions , applying , implying , inferring , conjecturing , deducing
of Arguments , wresting and exceeding the Law , the Circumstances , the
Depositions and Confessions , that unlearned Men maye bee inchanted to
thinke and judge those that bee things indifferente , or at the worst
but ouersights , to be great Treasons ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.81

such power Orators haue , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.82

and such Ignorance the Unlearned haue . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.83

Almighty God by the Mouth of his Prophete , doth conclude such Advocates
bee cursed , speaking these Words , Cursed bee hee that doth his office
craftily , corruptly , and maliciously . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.84

And consider also , that my Bloud shall be required at your hands , and
punished in you and yours , to the third and fourth Generation .
Notwithstanding you and the Justices excuse always such erronious doings
, when they be after called in question by the Verdict of the twelve Men
; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.85

but I assure you , the Purgation serueth you as it did <font> Pilate
<$$font> , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.86

and you washe your Handes of the Bloudshed , as <font> Pilate <$$font>
did of Christs . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.87

And now to your matter . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.88

<font> Stanford . <$$font> And it please you , my Lords , I doubt not
to proue euidently and manifestly , that <font> Throckmorton <$$font> is
worthely and rightly indicted and araigned of these Treasons , and that
he was a principall deuiser , procurer and contriver of the late
Rebellion , and that <font> Wyat <$$font> was but his Minister .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.89

How say you , <font> Throckmorton <$$font> ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.90

dyd not you send <font> Winter <$$font> to <font> Wyat <$$font> into
<font> Kent <$$font> , and did deuise that the Tower of <font> London
<$$font> shoulde be taken , with other Instructions concernyng <font>
Wyat's <$$font> Sturre and Rebellion ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.91

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> May it please you that I shall aunswer
particularly to the matters objected against me , in_as_muche as my
Memorie is not good , and the same much decayed since my greeuous
Emprisonment , with want of Sleep , and other Disquietnesse :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.92

I confesse I did say to <font> Winter <$$font> , that <font> Wyat
<$$font> was desirous to speake with him , as I understoode .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.93

<font> Stanford . <$$font> Yea Sir , and you deuised togither of the
taking of the Tower of <font> London <$$font> , and of the other great
Treasons . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C1.94

<P_I,65.C2>

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Noe , I did not so ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.96

proue it . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.97

<font> Stanford . <$$font> Yes Sir , you met with <font> Winter
<$$font> sundry times , as shall appeare , and in sundry Places .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.98

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> That graunted , proveth no such matter
as is supposed in the Inditement . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.99

<font> Stanford <$$font> red <font> Winter's <$$font> Confession ,
whyche was of this effect ; That <font> Throckmorton <$$font> mette with
<font> Winter <$$font> one Day in <font> Tower-street <$$font> , and
told him , that Sir <font> Thomas Wyat <$$font> was desirous to speak
with him , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.100

and <font> Winter <$$font> demanded where <font> Wyat <$$font> was :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.101

<font> Throckmorton <$$font> aunswered , at his House in <font> Kente
<$$font> , not farre from <font> Gillingham <$$font> , as I heard say ,
where the Shyps lye . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.102

Then they parted at that time , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.103

and shortly after <font> Throckmorton <$$font> met with <font> Winter
<$$font> , vnto whome <font> Winter <$$font> sayd , Maister <font> Wyat
<$$font> dothe much mislike the comming of the <font> Spanyardes
<$$font> into this Realme , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.104

and feareth their short arriuall here , in_as_much as dayly he heareth
thereof ; dothe see daily diuers of them arrive heere , scattered like
Soldyers ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.105

and therefore he thinketh good the Tower of <font> London <$$font>
should be taken by a sleighte , before the Prince came , least that
peece be deliuered to the <font> Spanyardes <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.106

How say you <font> Throckmorton <$$font> to it ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.107

<font> Throckmorton <$$font> aunswered , I mislike it for diuers
respects ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.108

euen so do I , sayde <font> Winter <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.109

At another tyme <font> Throckmorton <$$font> mette me the sayd <font>
Winter <$$font> in <font> Poules <$$font> , when hee had sent one to my
House to seeke me before ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.110

and he said to me , you are Admiral of the Fleet that now goeth into
<font> Spayne <$$font> . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.111

I aunswered yea . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.112

<font> Throckmorton <$$font> saide , when will your Shippes be ready ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.113

I saide , within tenne Dayes . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.114

<font> Throckmorton <$$font> sayde , I vnderstand you are appointed to
conduct and carrie the Lord Priuie_Seale into <font> Spaine <$$font> ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.115

and considring the Daunger of the <font> Frenchmen <$$font> , which you
say arme them to the Sea apace , me thinke it well done , you put my
sayde Lorde and his Traine on Lande in the West Country to avoyde all
Daungers . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.116

<font> Throckmorton <$$font> saide also , that <font> Wyat <$$font>
changed his purpose , for taking the Tower of <font> London <$$font> ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.117

I said I was glad of it : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.118

and as for the <font> Frenchmen <$$font> , I care not much for them ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.119

I will so handle the matter , that the Queenes shippes shall bee I
warrante you in safegard . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.120

Another time I met with M. <font> Throckmorton <$$font> when I came
from the Emperours Ambassadors , vnto whome I declared , that the
Emperour had sent me a fayre Cheyne , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.121

and shewed it unto <font> Throckmorton <$$font> , who said , for this
Cheyne you haue sold your Country . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.122

I saide , it is neyther <font> French <$$font> King nor Emperoure that
can make me sell my Country , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.123

but I will be a true <font> Englishman <$$font> :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.124

then they parted . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.125

This is the summe of the Talke betwixt <font> Throckmorton <$$font> and
<font> Winter <$$font> . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.126

<font> Stanford . <$$font> Now my Masters of the Jury , you haue heard
my Sayings confirmed with <font> Winter's <$$font> Confession :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.127

how say you <font> Throckmorton <$$font> , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.128

can you denie it ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.129

if you will , you shall haue <font> Winter <$$font> justifie it to your
Face . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.130

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> My Lords , shall it please you that I
shal answer ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.131

<font> Bromley . <$$font> Yea , say your mind .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.132

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I may truly denye some part of this
Confession ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.133

but bycause there is nothing material greatly , I suppose the whole to
be true , and what is herein deposed , sufficiente to bring me within
the compas of the Enditement . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.134

<font> Stanford . <$$font> It appeareth that you were of Counsel with
<font> Wyat <$$font> , in_as_much as you sente <font> Winter <$$font>
downe to him , who uttered unto him diuers traitorous Deuises .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.135

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> This is but conjectural ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,65.C2.136

yet sithence you will construe so maliciously , I will recompte
<P_I,66.C1> how I sent <font> Winter <$$font> to <font> Wyat <$$font> :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.137

and then I pray you of the Jury , judge better than Maister Sergeante
doth . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.138

I met by chance a Seruant of Maister <font> Wyat's <$$font> , who
demanded of me for <font> Winter <$$font> , and shewed mee , that his
Maister woulde gladly speake with him ; and so without any further
Declaration , desired me , if I met <font> Winter <$$font> , to tel him
Maister <font> Wyat's <$$font> mind , and where he was .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.139

Thus much for the sending downe of <font> Winter <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.140

<font> Attourney . <$$font> Yea , Sir , but how say you to the taking
of the Tower of <font> London <$$font> , which is Treason ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.141

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I aunswere , though <font> Wyat <$$font>
thought meete to attempt so daungerous an Enterprise , and that <font>
Winter <$$font> enformed me of it , you can@ @not extende <font> Wyat's
<$$font> Deuises to be mine , and to bring me within the compass of
Treason ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.142

for what maner of reasoning or proofe is this ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.143

<font> Wyat <$$font> woulde haue taken the Tower ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.144

<font> ergo Throckmorton <$$font> is a Traitor ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.145

<font> Winter <$$font> doth make my Purgation in his owne Confession ,
euen now redde as it was by Maister Sergeante , though I say nothing ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.146

for <font> Winter <$$font> doth auowe there , that I did much mislike it
. THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.147

And because you shall the better understand that I did alwayes not alow
these Master <font> Wyat's <$$font> Deuises , I had these Words to
<font> Winter <$$font> , when he enformed me of it ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.148

I think M. <font> Wyat <$$font> would no <font> Englishman <$$font>
hurt , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.149

and this Enterprise can@ @not be done without the hurt and slaughter of
both Parties ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.150

for I know him that hath the Charge of the Peece , and his Brother ,
both Men of good Seruice ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.151

the one had in charge a piece of great Importance , <font> Bolloyne
<$$font> I meane , which was stoutly assayled ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.152

and notwithstanding he made a goode accompt of it for his time , that
like I am sure he will do by this his Charge .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.153

Moreouer , to accompte the taking of the <font> Tower <$$font> is uery
dangerous by the Law . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.154

These were my Wordes to <font> Winter <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.155

And besides , it is very unlike , that I of all Men woulde confederate
in such a matter against the Lieutenant of the <font> Tower <$$font> ,
whose Daughter my Brother hath married , and his House and mine alyed
together by Mariage sundry times within these few Yeres .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.156

<font> Hare . <$$font> But how say you to this , that <font> Wyat
<$$font> and you had Conference togither sundry times at <font> Warner's
<$$font> House , and in other places ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.157

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> This is a very general Charge , to haue
Conference ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.158

but why was it not as lawful for me to confer with <font> Wyat <$$font>
, as with you , or any other Man ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.159

I then knew no more by <font> Wyat <$$font> , than by any other ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.160

and to proue to talke with <font> Wyat <$$font> was lawful and
indifferent , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.161

the last Day I did talke with <font> Wyat <$$font> , I sawe my Lord of
<font> Arondel <$$font> , with other noble Men and Gentlemen , talke
with him familiarly in the Chamber of Presence .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.162

<font> Hare . <$$font> But they did not conspire nor talke of any stur
against the <font> Spanyards <$$font> as you did pretend , and meant it
against the Queen ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.163

for you , <font> Croftes <$$font> , <font> Rogers <$$font> and <font>
Warner <$$font> , did oftentimes deuise in <font> Warner's <$$font>
House aboute youre traiterous purposes , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.164

or else what did you so often there ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.165

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I confess I did mislike the Queenes
Mariage with <font> Spain <$$font> , and also the comming of the <font>
Spanyards <$$font> hither : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.166

and then me thought I had reason to doe so ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.167

for I did learne the Reasons of my misliking of you M. <font> Hare
<$$font> , M. <font> Southwell <$$font> , and others in the Parliament
House ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.168

there I did see the whole Consent of the Realm against it ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.169

and I a Hearer , but no Speaker , did learne my misliking of those
Matters , confirmed by many sundry Reasons amongst you :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C1.170

but as concerning any sturre or <P_I,66.C2> vprore against the <font>
Spanyards <$$font> , I neuer made any , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.171

neyther procured any to be made ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.172

and for my much resort to M. <font> Warner's <$$font> House , it was
not to conferre with M. <font> Wyat <$$font> , but to shew my
Friendship to my very good Lord the Marques of <font> Northampton
<$$font> , who was lodged there when he was enlarged .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.173

<font> Stanford . <$$font> Did not you , <font> Throckmorton <$$font> ,
tell Winter that <font> Wyat <$$font> had changed his Mind for the
taking of the <font> Tower <$$font> ; whereby it appeared euidently that
you knew of his doings ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.174

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Truly I did not tell him so ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.175

but I care not greately to giue you that Weapon to play you withal :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.176

now let us see what you can make of it ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.177

<font> Stanford . <$$font> Yea , Sir , that proueth that you were
priuie to <font> Wyat's <$$font> Mind in all his Deuises and Treasons ,
and that there was sending betwixt you and <font> Wyat <$$font> from
time to time . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.178

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> What M. Sergeant , doth this proue
against me , that I knew <font> Wyat <$$font> did repent him of an euil
deuised Enterprise ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.179

Is it to know <font> Wyat's <$$font> Repentance , Sinne ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.180

No , it is but a Venial Sinne ; if it be any ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.181

it is not deadly . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.182

But where is the Messenger or Message that <font> Wyat <$$font> sent to
me touching his Alteration ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.183

and yet it was lawful ynough for me to heare from <font> Wyat <$$font>
at that time , as from any other Man , for any acte that I knew he had
done . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.184

<font> Dyer . <$$font> And it may please you , my Lordes , and you my
Maisters of the Jurie , to prove that <font> Throckmorton <$$font> is a
principal doer in this Rebellion , there is yet many other things to be
declared : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.185

amongst other , there is <font> Croftes <$$font> Confession , who sayeth
, that he and you and your Accomplices , did manye times deuise aboute
the whole Matters , and hee made you priuie to all his Determinations ,
and you shewed him that you woulde goe into the West Countrey with the
Earle of <font> Deuon <$$font> , to Sir <font> Peter Caroe <$$font> ,
accompanyed with others . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.186

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> M. <font> Croftes <$$font> is yet
liuing , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.187

and is here this day ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.188

how hapneth it he is not brought Face to Face to justifie this matter ,
neither hathe bin of all this time ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.189

Will you knowe the Trueth ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.190

either he sayd not so , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.191

or he wil not abide by it , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.192

but honestly hath reformed himself . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.193

And as for knowing his Deuises , I was so well acquainted with them ,
that I can name none of them , nor you neyther , as matter knowen to mee
. THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.194

<font> Attourney . <$$font> But why did you aduise <font> Winter
<$$font> to land my Lord Priuie_Seale in the West Countrey ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.195

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> He that told you that my mind was to
land him there , doth partly tel you a reason why I said so , if you
would remember as well the one as the other ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.196

but because you are so forgetful , I will recite wherefore :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.197

In communication betwixt <font> Winter <$$font> and me , as he declared
to me that the <font> Spanyards <$$font> provided to bring their Prince
hither , so the <font> Frenchmen <$$font> prepared to interrupt his
Arrival , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.198

for they began to arme to the Sea , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.199

and had already certain Shippes on the West Cost , <paren> as he heard
<$$paren> unto whom I saide , that peraduenture not onely the Queenes
Shippes under his Charge might be in jeopardy , but also my Lorde
Priuie_Seale , and all his Trayne , the <font> Frenchmen <$$font> beeing
wel prepared to meete with them ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.200

and therefore for all Euents it were good you should put my said Lord in
the West Countrey , in case you espie any jeoperdie .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.201

But what doth this proue to the Treasons , if I were not able to giue
conuenient Reasons to my talke ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,66.C2.202

<P_I,67.C1>

<font> Stanford . <$$font> Mary Sir , now commeth the Proofes of youre
Treasons : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.204

you shal heare what <font> Cutbert Vaughan <$$font> sayth against you .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.205

Then Sergeant <font> Stanford <$$font> did reade <font> Vaughan's
<$$font> Confession , tending to this effect , That <font> Vaughan
<$$font> comming out of <font> Kent <$$font> , met with <font>
Throckmorton <$$font> at M. <font> Warner's <$$font> House , who after
he had don Commendations from <font> Wyat <$$font> to him , desired to
know where <font> Crofts <$$font> was ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.206

<font> Throckmorton <$$font> answered , either at <font> Arundel
<$$font> House where he lodgeth , or in <font> Poules <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.207

Then <font> Vaughan <$$font> desired to know howe thyngs went at <font>
London <$$font> saying , M. <font> Wyat <$$font> and wee of <font> Kent
<$$font> do much mislike the Mariage with <font> Spaine <$$font> , and
the comming of the <font> Spanyardes <$$font> for diuers respectes ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.208

howbeit , if other Countries mislike them as <font> Kent <$$font> doth ,
they shall be but hardly welcome : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.209

and so they parted . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.210

Shortly after <font> Throckmorton <$$font> met with <font> Vaughan
<$$font> in <font> Poules <$$font> , unto whome <font> Throckmorton
<$$font> declared with sundry Circumstances , that the Western Men were
in readinesse to come forwards ; and that Sir <font> Peter Caroe
<$$font> had sent unto him euen now , and that he had in order a good
Band of Horsemen , and an other of Footemen .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.211

Then Vaughan demanded what the Erle of <font> Devon <$$font> would do ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.212

<font> Throckmorton <$$font> answered he will marre all ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.213

for he will not go hence ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.214

and yet Sir <font> Peter Caroe <$$font> wold mete him with a Band both
of Horsemen and Footemen , by the way of <font> Andeuer <$$font> , for
his Safeguard ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.215

and also he should haue bin well accompanyed from hence with other
Gentlemen , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.216

yet all this wyl not moue him to departe hence .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.217

Moreouer , the said Erle hath , as is said , discovered al the whole
matter to the Chancellor , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.218

or else it is comen out by his Taylor , aboute the trimming of a Shirte
of Mayle , and the making of a Cloke . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.219

At another time , <font> Vaughan <$$font> saith , <font> Throckmorton
<$$font> shewed him , that he had sent a Poste to Sir <font> Peter Caroe
<$$font> to come forwarde with as muche speede as might be , and to
bring his force with him . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.220

And also <font> Throckmorton <$$font> advised <font> Vaughan <$$font> to
will M. <font> Wyat <$$font> come forward with his Power ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.221

for nowe was the time , in_as_much as the <font> Londoners <$$font>
would take his part , if the matter were presented unto them .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.222

<font> Vaughan <$$font> said also , that <font> Throckmorton <$$font>
and <font> Warner <$$font> should haue ridden with the said Erle
Westward . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.223

Moreouer , the said <font> Vaughan <$$font> deposed , that <font>
Throckmorton <$$font> shewed him in talke of the Erle of <font> Pembroke
<$$font> , that the said Earle woulde not fight against them , though
hee woulde not take their partes . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.224

Also <font> Vaughan <$$font> said , That <font> Throckmorton <$$font>
shewed hym that he would ride downe to <font> Barkeshire <$$font> to Sir
<font> Francis Englefield's <$$font> House , there to meete his eldest
Brother , to moue him to take his part . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.225

And this was the Summe of <font> Cutbert Vaughan's <$$font> Confession .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.226

<font> Stanford . <$$font> How say you , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.227

doth not heere appeare euident matter to proue you a Principal , who not
onely gaue order to Sir <font> Peter Caroe <$$font> and his Adherents ,
for their rebellious actes in the West Countrey ; but also procured
<font> Wyat <$$font> to make his Rebellion , appointing him and the
others also , when they should attempt their Enterprise , and how they
should order their doings from time to time ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.228

Besides all this euident Matter , you were specially appointed to go
away with the Earle of <font> Devon <$$font> , as one that would direct
all thinges , and giue order to all Men ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.229

and therefore <font> Throckmorton <$$font> , since this matter is so
manifest , and the euidence so apparent , I would aduise you to confesse
your fault , and submit your selfe to the Queenes Mercy .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C1.230

<P_I,67.C2>

<font> Bromley . <$$font> Howe say you , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.232

will you confesse the matter ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.233

and it will be best for you . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.234

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> No , I will neuer accuse my selfe
unjustly ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.235

but in_as_muche as I am come hither to bee tried , I pray you let me
haue the Law favourably . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.236

<font> Attourney . <$$font> It is apparent that you lay at <font>
London <$$font> as a Factor , to giue Intelligence as well to them in
the West , as to <font> Wyat <$$font> in <font> Kent <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.237

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> How proue you that ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.238

or who doth accuse me but this condemned Man ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.239

<font> Attourney . <$$font> Why , will you denie this matter ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.240

you shall haue <font> Vaughan <$$font> justifie his whole Confession
here before your Face . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.241

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> It shal not neede ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.242

I know his unshamefastnes , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.243

he hath aduowed some of this vntrue talk before this tyme to my Face ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.244

and it is not otherwise like , considering the price , but he wil do the
same again . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.245

<font> Attourney . <$$font> My Lords and Maisters , you shall haue
<font> Vaughan <$$font> to justifie this heere before you all , and
confirm it with a Booke Oth . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.246

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> He that hath said and lyed , will not ,
being in this case , sticke to swear and lye .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.247

<font> Then was <$$font> Cutbert Vaughan <font> brought into the open
Court <$$font> . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.248

<font> Sendall . <$$font> How say you , <font> Cutbert Vaughan <$$font>
, THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.249

is this your own Confession , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.250

and wil you abide by all that is here written ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.251

<font> Vaughan . <$$font> Let me see it , and I will tell you .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.252

Then his Confession was shewed him . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.253

<font> Attourney . <$$font> Bycause you of the Jury the better may
credite him , I pray you my Lords let <font> Vaughan <$$font> be sworn .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.254

<font> Then was <$$font> Vaughan <font> sworne on a Booke to say nothing
but the Truth <$$font> . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.255

<font> Vaughan . <$$font> It may please you my Lords and Maisters , I
could haue bin well content to haue chose seauen Yeres Imprisonment ,
though I had bin a free Man in the Law , rather than I would this Day
haue gyuen Euidence against Sir <font> Nicholas Throckmorton <$$font> ,
vnto whome I bear no displeasure ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.256

but sithence I must needes confesse my Knowledge , I must confesse all
that is there written is true . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.257

How say you M. <font> Throckmorton <$$font> ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.258

was there any displeasure betwene you and me , to moue me to say aught
against you ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.259

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Not , that I know :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.260

how say you <font> Vaughan <$$font> , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.261

what Acquaintance was there between you and me ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.262

and what Letters of Credit , or Token did you bring me from <font> Wyat
<$$font> , or any other to moue me to trust you ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.263

<font> Vaughan . <$$font> As for Acquaintance , I knew you as I did
other Gentlemen ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.264

and as for Letters , I brought you none other but Commendations from M.
<font> Wyat <$$font> , as I did to diuers other of his Acquaintance at
<font> London <$$font> . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.265

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> You might as well forge the
Commendations as the rest ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.266

but if you haue done with <font> Vaughan <$$font> , my Lords , I pray
you giue me leaue to aunswere . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.267

<font> Bromely . <$$font> Speak , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.268

and be short . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.269

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I speak generally to all that be heere
present , but especially to you of my Jury , touching the Credit of
<font> Vaughan's <$$font> Depositions against me , a condemned Man ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.270

and after to the Matter : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,67.C2.271

and note I pray you the Circumstances , <P_I,68.C1> the better to induce
somewhat material . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.272

First I pray you remember the small Familiaritie betwixt <font> Vaughan
<$$font> and me , as he hathe auowed before you .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.273

And moreouer , to procure Credite at my hand , he brought neither Letter
nor Token from <font> Wyat <$$font> , nor from any other to me , which
he also hath confessed here , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.274

and I will suppose <font> Vaughan <$$font> to be in as good Condition as
any other Man here , that is to say , an uncondemn'd Man ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.275

yet I referre it to your good Judgment , whether it were lyke that I
knowing onely <font> Vaughan's <$$font> Person from another Man , and
having none other Acquaintance with him , would so frankly discouer my
mind to him in so dangerous a matter . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.276

How like , I say , is this , when diuers of these Gentlemen now in
Captiuitie , being my very Familiars , coulde not depose any such matter
against me , and neuertheless vpon their Examinations haue said what
they could ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.277

And thogh I be no wise Man , I am not so rash to vtter to an unknowen
Man <paren> for so may I call him in comparison <$$paren> a matter so
dangerous for me to speake , and him to heare ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.278

but bycause my Trueth and his Falsehood shall the better appear unto you
, I will declare his Inconstancy in vttering this his Euidence ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.279

and for my better Credite , it may please you , M. <font> Southwell
<$$font> , I take you to witnes , when <font> Vaughan <$$font> first
justified this his unjust Accusation against me before the L. <font>
Paget <$$font> , the L. Chamberlaine , you M. <font> Southwell
<$$font> , and others , he referred the Confirmation of this surmised
matter to a Letter sent from him to Sir <font> Thomas Wyat <$$font> ;
which Letter doth neither appeare , nor any Testimony of the said M.
<font> Wyat <$$font> against mee touching the matter :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.280

for I doubte not Sir <font> Thomas Wyat <$$font> hath bin examin'd of me
, and hathe sayde what he could directly or indirectly .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.281

Also <font> Vaughan <$$font> saith , that yong <font> Edward Wyat
<$$font> coulde confirme this matter , as one that knew this pretended
Discourse betwixt <font> Vaughan <$$font> and me ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.282

and thereupon I made sute that <font> Edward Wyat <$$font> might either
be brought face to face to me , or otherwise be examined .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.283

<font> Southwell . <$$font> M. <font> Throckmorton <$$font> , you
mistake your matter , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.284

for <font> Vaughan <$$font> said , that <font> Edward Wyat <$$font> did
know some part of the matter , and also was priuie to the Letter that
<font> Vaughan <$$font> sent to Sir <font> Thomas Wyat <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.285

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Yea , Sir , that was <font> Vaughan's
<$$font> last shift , when I charged him before the Master of the Horse
, and you with his former Allegations touching his witnes ; whom when
hee espyed , woulde not do so lewdly as hee thought ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.286

then he vsed this Alteration : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.287

but where is <font> Edward Wyat's <$$font> Depositions of any thing
against me , now it appeareth neither his firste nor his last Tale to be
true ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.288

For you knowe , M. <font> Bridges <$$font> , and so doth my Lord your
Brother , that I desired twice or thrice <font> Edward Wyat <$$font>
shuld be examined ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.289

and I am sure , and most assured , he hathe bin willed to say what he
could , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.290

and here is nothing deposed by him against me , eyther touching any
Letter or other Conference ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.291

or where is <font> Vaughan's <$$font> Letter sent by Sir <font> Thomas
Wyat <$$font> concerning my Talke ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.292

But now I will speake of <font> Vaughan's <$$font> present Estate , in
that he is a condemned Man , whose Testimonie is nothing worthe by any
Lawe ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.293

and bycause false Witnes be mentioned in the Gospel , treating of
Accusation , hearke I pray you what S. <font> Jerome <$$font> sayeth ,
expounding the place : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.294

it is demanded why Christes accusers be called false Witnesses , which
did report Christ's Words not as he spake them ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C1.295

they be false witnesses saith S. <font> Jerome <$$font> , <P_I,68.C2>
which do ad , alter , wrest , double , or do speake for hope to auoid
Death , or for malice to procure another Man's Death :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.296

for all Men may easily gather he can@ @not speake truely of me , or in
the case of another Man's Life , where he hath hope of his owne by
Accusation . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.297

Thus much speaketh S. <font> Jerome <$$font> of false Witnes .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.298

By the ciuil Law there be many Exceptions to be taken agaynst such
Testimonies ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.299

but bycause we be not gouerned by that Law , neither I haue my Trial by
it , it shal be superfluous to trouble you therewith ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.300

and therefore you shall heare what your owne Lawe doth say .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.301

There was a Statute made in my late Soueraigne Lord and Maister his time
, touching Accusation , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.302

and these be the Words : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.303

Be it enacted , That no Person nor Persons , &c. shall be indited ,
araigned , condemned , or conuicted for any Offence of Treason , Petit
Treason , Misprision of Treason , for which the same Offendor shal
suffer any Paynes of Death , Imprisonment , Losse or Forfeyture of his
Goodes , Lands , &c. vnlesse the same Offendor be accused by two
sufficient and lawful Witnesses , or shall willingly without Violence
confesse the same . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.304

And also in the sixth Yere of his Raigne , it is thus ratified as
ensueth : That no Person nor Persons shall bee indited , araigned ,
condemned , conuicted or attainted of the Treasons or Offences
aforesaide , or for anye other Treasons that now bee , or hereafter
shall be , unlesse the same Offendor or Offendors be thereof accused by
two lawfull and sufficient Accusers ; whiche at the time of Araignement
of the Parties so accused <paren> if they be then liuing <$$paren> shall
be brought in Person before the said Partie accused , and auowe and
mainteine that they haue to say againste the saide Partie , to proue him
giltie of the Treasons or Offence conteined in the Byll of Inditement
layd agaynst the Partie araigned , vnlesse the sayd Partie araigned
shall be willing without Violence to confesse the same .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.305

Here note I pray you , that our Lawe dothe require two lawfull and
sufficient Accusers to be brought face to face ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.306

and <font> Vaughan <$$font> is but one , and the same most vnlawfull and
insufficient ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.307

for who can be more unlawful and insufficient than a condemned Man , and
suche one as knoweth to accuse mee is the meane to saue his owne Lyfe ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.308

Remember , I pray you , howe long and how many times <font> Vaughan's
<$$font> Execution hathe bin respited , and how often hee hathe bin
conjured to accuse , <paren> whych by Goddes Grace hee withstoode vntill
the last Houre <$$paren> what time perceyuing there was no way to liue ,
but to speake againste mee or some other <paren> his former Grace beeyng
taken away <$$paren> did redeeme his Lyfe most unjustly and shamefully ,
as you see . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.309

<font> Hare . <$$font> Why shoulde he accuse you more than any other ,
seeyng there was no displeasure betwixte you , if the matter had not bin
true ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.310

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Bycause he must eyther speake of some
Man , or suffer Deathe ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.311

and then he did rather choose to hurte him he did least know , and so
loued least , than any other well knowen to him , whome he loued most .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.312

But to you of my Jury I speake specially , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.313

and therefore I pray you note what I say : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.314

In a matter of lesse weight than Trial of Life and Lande , a Man may by
the Law take Exceptions to suche as be impaneld , to trie the
Controuersies betwixt the Parties : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,68.C2.315

as for example , a Man may chalenge that the Sheriffe is hys Enemie ,
and therefore hathe made a parciall Returne , <P_I,69.C1> or bycause one
of the Jury is the Sheriffe my Aduersarie@ @s Seruante ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.316

and also in case my Aduersaries Villaine or Bondman be empanelled , I
may lawfully chalenge him , bycause the Aduersarie parte hathe power
ouer hys Villayne's Landes and Goodes , and hathe the vse of hys Bodye
for seruile Office : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.317

muche more I may of right take Exception to <font> Vaughan's <$$font>
Testimonie , my Lyfe and all that I haue depending therevppon ; and the
same <font> Vaughan <$$font> beeyng more bounde to the Queenes Highnesse
, my Aduersarie <paren> that wo is me therefore , but so the Lawe dothe
here so tearme hyr Majestie <$$paren> than anye Villayne is to hys Lord
; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.318

for hir Hyghnesse hath not onely Power ouer hys Bodye , Lands , and
Goodes , but ouer his Lyfe also . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.319

<font> Stanford . <$$font> Yea , the Exceptions are to be taken
agaynste the Jury in that case ; but not agaynst the Witnes or Accusor ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.320

and therefore youre Argument serueth little for you .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.321

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> That is not so ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.322

for the vse of the Jurie , and the Witnes , and the Effect of their
doings doth serue me to my purpose , as the Law shall discusse .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.323

And thus I make my Comparison : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.324

By the Ciuil Law the Judge doth giue Sentence upon the Depositions of
the Witnes , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.325

and by your Law the Judge doth giue Judgement upon the Verdict of the
Jury , so as the effect is both one to finish the matter , Trial in Law
, as well by the Depositions of the Witnes , as by the Juries Verdict ,
though they varie in Forme and Circumstance ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.326

and so <font> Vaughan's <$$font> Testimonie being credited , may be the
material Cause of my Condemnation , as the Jury may be induced by his
Depositions to speak their Verdict , and so finally therevpon the Judge
to giue Sentence . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.327

Therefore I may use the same Exceptions against the Jury , or any of
them , as the principal mean , that shall occasion my Condemnation .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.328

<font> Bromley . <$$font> Why , do you denie , that euery part of
<font> Vaughan's <$$font> Tale is untrue ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.329

<font> Attourney . <$$font> You may see he will denie all , and say
there was no such Communication betwixt them .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.330

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I confesse some part of <font> Vaughan's
<$$font> Confession to be true , as the Name , the Places , the Time ,
and some part of the Matter . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.331

<font> Attourney . <$$font> So you of the Jury may perceiue the
Prisoner doth confesse some thing to be true .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.332

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> As touching my sending to Sir <font>
Peter Caroe <$$font> , or his sending to me , or concerning my Aduice to
M. <font> Wyat <$$font> to sturre , or to repaire hither , or touchyng
the Earl of <font> Deuon <$$font> parting hence , and my going with him
, and also concerning the matter of the Earle of <font> Pembroke
<$$font> , I do aduow and say that <font> Vaughan <$$font> hath said
untruely . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.333

<font> Southwell . <$$font> As for my Lord of <font> Pembroke <$$font>
, you neede not excuse the matter , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.334

for he hath shewed himselfe cleere in these matters like a Nobleman ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.335

and that we all know . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.336

<font> Hare . <$$font> Why what was the talke betwixt <font> Vaughan
<$$font> and you so long in <font> Poules <$$font> , if these were not
so , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.337

and what meant your oft Meetings ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.338

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> As for our often Meetings , they were of
no set purpose , but by chance , and yet no oftner than twice ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.339

but sithence you would know what Communication passed betwixt us in
<font> Poules <$$font> Church , I will declare .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.340

We talked of the Incommodities of the Marriage of the Queene with the
Prince of <font> Spayne <$$font> , and how {HELSINKI:missing_"how"}
grieuous the <font> Spanyards <$$font> would be to vs here .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C1.341

<font> Vaughan <$$font> said , that it should be very dangerous for any
Man that truly professed the Gospel to liue here , such was the <font>
Spanyards <$$font> Crueltie , and especially against <P_I,69.C2>
Christian Men . Whereunto I answered , it was the Plague of God come
justly vpon vs ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.342

and now Almighty God dealt with vs , as he did with the <font>
Israelites <$$font> , taking from them for their vnthankefulnes their
Godly Kings , and did send Tirants to raign over them ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.343

even so he handled us <font> Englishmen <$$font> , whiche hadde a most
godly and vertuous Prince to raigne ouer vs , my late Soueraigne Lord
and Maister King <font> Edwarde <$$font> , vnder whome we might both
safely and lawfully professe Gods Word ; which with our lewd doyngs ,
demeanour , and liuing , we handled so irreuerently , that to whip vs
for our Faultes , he woulde send vs Straungers , yea such very Tyrants
to exercise great Tyrannie ouer vs , and did take away the vertuous and
faithfull King from amongst us ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.344

for euery Man of euery Estate did colour his naughty Affections with a
pretence of Religion , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.345

and made the Gospell a staulking Horse to bring their euil desires to
effect . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.346

This was the Summe of our talke in <font> Poules <$$font> , somewhat
more dilated . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.347

<font> Stanford . <$$font> That it may appeare yet more euidently howe
<font> Throckmorton <$$font> was a principal Doer and Counsellor in this
matter , you shall heare his owne Confession of his own hand writing .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.348

The Clerke did begin to reade ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.349

<font> Throckmorton <$$font> desired M. <font> Stanford <$$font> to
read it , and the Jury well to marke it . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.350

Then M. <font> Stanford <$$font> did read the Prisoner's own Confession
to this effect , that <font> Throckmorton <$$font> had Conference with
<font> Wyat , Caroe , Croftes , Rogers <$$font> and <font> Warner
<$$font> , as well of the Queenes Mariage with the Prince of <font>
Spayne <$$font> , as also of Religion , and did particularly confer with
euery the forenamed of the matters aforesaid .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.351

Moreouer , with Sir <font> Thomas Wyat <$$font> , the Prisoner talked of
the bruite , that the Western Men should much mislike the comming of the
<font> Spanyards <$$font> into this Realme , beeing reported also that
they intended to interrupt theyr arriual here . And also that it was
said , that they wer in consultation about the same at <font> Exeter
<$$font> . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.352

<font> Wyat <$$font> also did say , that Sir <font> Peter Caroe <$$font>
could not bring the same matter to good effect ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.353

nor was there any Man so mete to bring it to good effect , as the Erle
of <font> Devon <$$font> ; and especially in the West Country ,
in_as_much as they did not draw al by one line .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.354

Then <font> Throckmorton <$$font> ask'd how the <font> Kentishmen
<$$font> were affected to the <font> Spanyards <$$font> ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.355

<font> Wyat <$$font> said , the People like them euill ynough ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.356

and that appeared now at the comming of the Count <font> Egmont <$$font>
, THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.357

for they were ready to sturre against him and his Traine , supposing it
had bin the Prince ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.358

but said <font> Wyat <$$font> , Sir <font> Robert Southwel <$$font> , M.
<font> Baker <$$font> , and M. <font> Moyle <$$font> , and their
Affinitie , which bee in good Credite in some places of the Shire , wil
for other malicious Respects hinder the Libertie of their Country .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.359

Then <font> Throckmorton <$$font> shuld say , though I know ther hath
bin an vnkindnesse betwixt M. <font> Southwell <$$font> and you for a
Money matter , wherein I trauelled to make you Friends , I doubt not ,
but in so honest a matter as this is , he will for the safegard of his
Country joyne with you , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.360

and so you may be sure of the Lord <font> Burgainey <$$font> and his
Force . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.361

Then <font> Wyat <$$font> said , it is for another matter than for Money
that we disagree , wherein he hath handled me and others very doubly and
vnneighbourly ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.362

howbeit he can do no other , neither to me , nor to anye other Man ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.363

and therefore I forgiue him . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,69.C2.364

<font> Item <$$font> , with Sir <font> Peter Caroe , Throckmorton
<$$font> had Conference touching the Impeachment of the landing of the
said Prince , and touchyng Prouision of Armour and Munition , as ensueth
; <P_I,70.C1> that is to say , that Sir <font> Peter Caroe <$$font> told
<font> Throckmorton <$$font> , that he trusted his Countrymen would be
true <font> Englishmen <$$font> , and would not agree to let the <font>
Spanyards <$$font> to gouerne them . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.365

<font> Item <$$font> , the said Sir <font> Peter Caroe <$$font> sayd ,
the matter importing the <font> French <$$font> King as it did , he
thought the <font> French <$$font> King would work to hinder the <font>
Spanyards <$$font> coming hither , with whome the said Sir <font> Peter
<$$font> dyd thinke good to practise for Armour , Municions and Money .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.366

Then <font> Throckmorton <$$font> did advise him to beware that he
brought any <font> Frenchmen <$$font> into the Realme forceably ,
in_as_much as he could as euill abyde the <font> Frenchmen <$$font>
after that sort as the <font> Spanyards <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.367

And also <font> Throckmorton <$$font> thought the <font> French <$$font>
King vnable to giue aide to vs , by meanes of the great Consumption in
their own Warres . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.368

M. <font> Caroe <$$font> said , as touching the bringing in of <font>
Frenchmen <$$font> , he meant it not , for he loued neither Partie , but
to serue his own Countrey , and to help his Countrey from Bondage ;
declaring further to <font> Throckmorton <$$font> , that he had a small
Barke of his owne to worke his practise by ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.369

and so he said , that shortely he intended to depart to his own Countrey
to vnderstand the Deuotion of his Countrymen .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.370

<font> Item , Throckmorton <$$font> did say , he would for his part
hinder the comming in of the <font> Spaniards <$$font> as much as he
could by Perswasion . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.371

<font> Item <$$font> , to Sir <font> Edward Warner <$$font> , he had and
did bemone his owne Estate , and the Tyrannie of the tyme extended upon
dyuers honest Persons for Religion , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.372

and wished it were lawfull for all of each Religion to liue safely
according to their Conscience ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.373

for the Law <paren> Ex officio <$$paren> will be intolerable ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.374

and the Cleargies discipline now may rather be resembled to the <font>
Turks <$$font> Tyrannie , than to the teaching of Christian Religion .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.375

This was the Summe of the matter , whiche was red in the foresaid
Confession , as matters most grieuous against the Prisoner .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.376

Then <font> Throckmorton <$$font> said , sithence M. Sergeante you haue
red and gathered the place as you think , that maketh most against me ,
I pray you take the Paynes , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.377

and reade further , that hereafter whatsoeuer become of me , my Words be
not peruerted and abused to the hurt of som others , and especially
against the great Personages , of whome I haue bin sundry times <paren>
as appeareth by my Answers <$$paren> examined ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.378

for I perceiue the Net was not cast only for little Fishes , but for the
great ones , juxta adagium . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.379

<font> Stanford . <$$font> It shall be but losse of tyme ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.380

and we haue other things to charge you withall ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.381

and this that you desire doth make nothing for you .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.382

<font> Dyer . <$$font> And for the better Confirmation of al the
Treasons objected against the Prisoner , and therein to proue him giltie
, you of the Jury shall heare the Duke of <font> Suffolke@ @s
Depositions against him , who was a Principal , and hath suffered
accordingly . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.383

Then the said Sergeant red the Dukes Confession touching the Prisoner ,
amounting to this effect ; That the Lord <font> Thomas Grey <$$font> did
informe the said Duke , that Sir <font> Nicholas Throckmorton <$$font>
was privie to the whole Deuises againste the <font> Spanyardes <$$font>
, and was one that shoulde goe into the <font> West-Country <$$font>
with the Earle of <font> Deuonshire <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.384

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> But what doth the principall Author of
thys matter say against me , I mean the Lord <font> Thomas Grey <$$font>
, who is yet liuing ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.385

Why is not his Deposition brought against me ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.386

for so it ought to bee , if he can say any thing ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.387

Will you know the Trueth ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C1.388

Neyther the Lord <font> Thomas Grey <$$font> hath sayd , can say , or
wil say any thing against me , notwithstanding the Duke his Brother@ @s
Confession <P_I,70.C2> and Accusation , who hathe affirmed manye other
things besides the Trueth . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.389

I speake not without certaine knowledge : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.390

for the Lord <font> Thomas Grey <$$font> , being my Prison-Fellow for a
small time , informed me , that the Duke his Brother had misreported him
in many things , amongst others in matters touching me , which he had
declared to you Mr. <font> Southwell <$$font> , and other the Examinors
not long ago . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.391

I am sure if the Lord <font> Thomas <$$font> could or would haue said
any thing , it should haue bin here now : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.392

And as to the Dukes Confession , it is not material ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.393

for he doth referre the matter to the Lord <font> Thomas@ @'s <$$font>
Report , who hath made my Purgation . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.394

<font> Attorney . <$$font> And it please you my Lordes , and you my
Maisters of the Jury , besides these matters touching <font> Wyats
<$$font> Rebellion , Sir <font> Peter Caroes <$$font> Treasons , and
confederating with the Duke of <font> Suffolke <$$font> ; and besides
the Prisoners Conspiracie with the Earle of <font> Deuon <$$font> , with
<font> Crofts , Rogers , Warner <$$font> , and sundry others in sundrye
Places , it shall manifestly appeare vnto you , that <font> Throckmorton
<$$font> did conspire the Queens Majesties Death with <font> William
Thomas <$$font> , Sir <font> Nicholas Arnold <$$font> , and other
Traitors intending the same ; which is the greatest matter of all others
, and most to be abhorred ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.395

and for the Proofe hereof you shall heare what <font> Arnold <$$font>
sayth . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.396

Then was Sir <font> Nicholas Arnold's <$$font> Confession redde ,
affirming that <font> Throckmorton <$$font> shewed vnto him , riding
betwixt <font> Hinam <$$font> and <font> Crosse Laund <$$font> in <font>
Glocestershire <$$font> , that <font> John Fitz-williams <$$font> was
verye much displeased with <font> William Thomas <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.397

<font> Attorney . William Thomas <$$font> devised , that <font> John
Fitzwilliams <$$font> should kyll the Quene ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.398

and <font> Throckmorton <$$font> knew of it , as appeareth by <font>
Arnold's <$$font> Confession . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.399

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> First I denie that I saide anye suche
thing to Mr. <font> Arnold <$$font> ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.400

and though he be an honest Man , he may either forget himself , or
deuise meanes how to vnburthen himselfe of so weightie a matter as this
is ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.401

for he is charged with the mater as principal , which I did perceiue
when he charged mee with his Tale ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.402

and therefore I do blame him the lesse , that he seeketh how to
discharge himself , vsing me as a witnes , if he could so transferre the
Deuice to <font> William Thomas <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.403

But truely , I neuer spake anye suche wordes vnto him ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.404

and for my better Declaration , I did see <font> John Fitzwilliams
<$$font> here euen now , who can testifie , that he neuer shewed me of
any Displeasure betwixt them : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.405

and as I know nothing of the Displeasure betwixt them , so I know
nothing of the Cause . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.406

I pray you , my Lordes , let him bee called to depose in thys matter
what hee can . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.407

Then <font> John Fitzwilliams <$$font> drew to the Barre ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.408

and presented himselfe to depose his knowledg in the matter in open
Court . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.409

<font> Attorney . <$$font> I pray you , my Lordes , suffer him not to
be sworne , neither to speake ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.410

we haue nothing to do with him . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.411

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Why shulde hee not bee suffered to tell
Truthe ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.412

And why bee yee not so well contented to heare Troth for mee , as
Untroth against me ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.413

<font> Hare . <$$font> Who called you hither <font> Fitzwilliams
<$$font> , or commaunded you to speake ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.414

you are a verye busie Officer . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.415

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I called him ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.416

and doe humbly desire , that he may speake and be heard as well as
<font> Vaughan <$$font> , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.417

or else I am not indifferently vsed ; specially seeing Maister Atturny
doth so presse this matter against me . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,70.C2.418

<P_I,71.C1>

<font> Southwell . <$$font> Goe youre wayes <font> Fitzwilliams
<$$font> , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.420

the Courte hath nothing to doe with you ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.421

peraduenture you woulde not bee so readie in a good Cause .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.422

Then <font> John Fitzwilliams <$$font> departed the Court ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.423

and was not suffered to speake . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.424

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Since this Gentlemans Declaration maye
not bee admitted , I trust you of the Jurie can perceyue , it was not
for anye thing hee had to say against me ; but contrariwise , that it
was feared he woulde speake for mee . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.425

And nowe to Maister <font> Arnoldes <$$font> Depositions against me , I
say I did not tell him anye such wordes ; so as if it were material ,
there is but his yea and my nay . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.426

But because the wordes be not sore strayned against me , I praye you ,
Maister Atturney , why might not I haue tolde Maister <font> Arnolde
<$$font> , that <font> John Fitzwilliams <$$font> was angrie with <font>
William Thomas <$$font> , and yet knowe no cause of the Anger ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.427

it might be vnderstande , to disagree oftentimes .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.428

Who doth confesse that I knowe any thing of <font> William Thomas
<$$font> Deuise touching the Quenes Death ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.429

I will aunswere , no Man : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.430

For Maister <font> Arnolde <$$font> doth mention no worde of that matter
, but of the Displeasures betwixte them ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.431

and to speake that , dothe neyther proove Treason , nor knowledge of
Treason . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.432

Is here all the Euidence againste me that you haue to bring mee within
the compasse of the Inditement ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.433

<font> Stanford . <$$font> Me@ @thinke the Matters confessed by others
against you , together with your owne Confession , will weye shrewdlye .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.434

But howe saye you to the Rising in <font> Kent <$$font> , and to <font>
Wiats <$$font> Attempte againste the Queenes Royal Person at hir Palace
? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.435

<font> Bromley . <$$font> Whye do you not reade <font> Wiat's <$$font>
Accusation to him , whiche dothe make him Partener to his Treasons ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.436

<font> Southwell . Wiat <$$font> hath grieuouslye accused you , and in
manye thinges that others haue confirmed .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.437

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Whatsoeuer <font> Wiat <$$font> hath
saide of me in hope of his Life , he vnsayde it at his Death .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.438

For since I came into this Hall , I hearde one saye <paren> but I knowe
him not <$$paren> that <font> Wiat <$$font> , upon the Scaffolde , didde
not onelye purge my Ladie <font> Elizabeth <$$font> hir Grace , and the
Earle of <font> Deuonshire <$$font> , but also al the Gentlemen in the
<font> Tower <$$font> , saying , they were all ignoraunt of the Sturre
and Commotion ; in whiche number I take my selfe .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.439

<font> Hare . <$$font> Notwithstanding he saide , all that he had
written and confessed to the Counsayle , was true .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.440

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Nay , Sir , by your patience , Maister
<font> Wiat <$$font> sayde not so , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.441

that was Maister Doctors Addicion . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.442

<font> Southwell . <$$font> It appeareth you haue hadde good
Intelligence . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.443

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Almightie God prouided that Reuelation
for mee this Daye since I came hither : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.444

for I haue bene in close Prison these lviii. Dayes , where I hearde
nothing but what the Birdes tolde mee , which did flie ouer my heade .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.445

And nowe to you of my Jurie I speake especiallye , whome I desire to
marke attentively , what shall be sayde : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.446

I haue been indited , as it appeareth , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C1.447

and now am arreigned of compassing the Queenes Majesties Death , of
levying Warre againste the Queene , of taking the Tower of <font> London
<$$font> , of deposing and depriuing the Queene of hir Royall Estate ,
and finally to destroy hir , and of adherence to the Queenes Enimies .
Of all whiche Treasons , to proue mee guiltie , the Queenes learned
Counsayle hath giuen in Euidence these Pointes materiall : that is to
saye , for the compassing or imagining the Queenes Death , and the
<P_I,71.C2> Destruction of hir Royal Person , Sir <font> Nicholas
Arnoldes <$$font> Depositions ; whiche is , that I shoulde saye to the
said Sir <font> Nicholas <$$font> in <font> Glocestershire <$$font> that
Maister <font> John Fitzwilliams <$$font> was angrie with <font> William
Thomas <$$font> . Whereunto I haue aunswered , as you haue hearde ,
bothe denying the matter ; and for the proofe on my side , doe take
Exceptions , bicause there is no Witnesse but one .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.448

And neuerthelesse , though it were graunted , the Depositions proue
nothing concerning the Queenes Death . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.449

For leuying of Warre againste the Queene , there is alledged my
Conference with Sir <font> Thomas Wiat <$$font> , Sir <font> James
Crofts <$$font> , Sir <font> Edwarde Rogers <$$font> , Sir <font>
Edwarde Warner <$$font> , againste the Marriage with <font> Spaine
<$$font> , and the comming of the <font> Spaniardes <$$font> hither ;
which talke I doe not denie in sorte as I spake it , and ment it ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.450

and notwithstanding the maliciovs gathering this Day of my Conference ,
proueth yet no levying of Warre . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.451

There is also alledged for proofe of the same Article , Sir <font> James
Croft's <$$font> Confession , which as you remember , implieth no such
thing , but generall talk againste the Mariage with <font> Spaine
<$$font> , and of my departing Westwarde with the Earl of <font> Devon
<$$font> , which the sayde <font> James <$$font> doth not auowe ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.452

and therefore I praye you consider it as not spoken .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.453

There is also for proofe of the sayde Article , the Duke of <font>
Suffolke@ @s <$$font> Confession , with whom I neuer had Conference ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.454

and therefore he advouched the tale of his Brother's Mouth , who hath
made my Purgation in those Matters , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.455

and yet if the matter were proued , they be not greatly materiall in
Lawe . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.456

There is also alledged for the further proofe of the same Article , and
for deposing and depriuing the Queene of hir Royall Estate , and for my
adhering to the Queenes Enimies , <font> Cuthert Vaughan's <$$font>
Confession , whose Testimonie I have sufficiently disproued by sundrie
Authorities and Circumstances , and principally by your owne Lawe ,
which dothe require two lawfull and sufficient Witnesses to be brouyght
face to face . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.457

Also for the taking of the Tower of <font> London <$$font> , there is
alledged <font> Winter's <$$font> Depositions , which vttereth my
misliking , when he vttered vnto mee Sir <font> Thomas Wiat's <$$font>
Resolution and Deuise for attempting of the sayde peece .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.458

And last of all , to enforce these matters , mine owne Confession is
engrieued greatly against me , wherein there doth appeare neyther
Treason , neyther concelement of Treason , neyther whispering of Treason
, nor procurement of Treason . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.459

And for_as_much as I am come hither to be tried by the Lawe , though my
Innocencie of all these Pointes materiall objected , be apparant to
acquite mee , whervnto I doe principallye cleaue ; yet I will for your
better Credit and Satisfactions shewe you euidentlye , that if you
woulde beleeue all the Depositions layde against me , which I trust you
will not doe , I ought not to be attainted of the Treason comprised
within my Inditement , considering the Statute of Repeale the last
Parliament , of all Treasons , other than suche as be declared in the
xxv. Yeare of King <font> Edwarde <$$font> the Third ; both which
Statutes I pray you my Lords may be redde here to the Enquest .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.460

<font> Bromley . <$$font> No , for there shall be no Bookes brought at
your desire ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.461

we know the Law sufficiently withoute Booke .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.462

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Do you bring me hither to trie mee by
the Lawe , and will not shewe me the Lawe ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.463

What is your Knowledge of the Lawe to these Mens Satisfactions , which
haue my Triall in hande ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,71.C2.464

I pray you , my Lordes , and my Lordes <P_I,72.C1> all , let the
Statutes bee redde , as well for the Queene , as for mee .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.465

<font> Stanford . <$$font> My Lord Chief Justice can shew the Lawe ,
and will , if the Jurie doe doubt of any Poynt .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.466

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> You knowe it were indifferent that I
should knowe and heare the Law whereby I am adjudged ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.467

and forasmuch as the Statute is in <font> Englishe <$$font> , Men of
meaner Learning than the Justices , can vnderstande it ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.468

or else how shoulde we know when we offend ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.469

<font> Hare . <$$font> You knowe not what belongeth to youre case ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.470

and therefore we must teach you : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.471

it appertaineth not to vs to prouide Bookes for you ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.472

neyther sit wee here to be taught of you ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.473

you should haue taken better hede to the Law before you had come hither
. THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.474

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Bicause I am ignoraunt , I woulde learne
, THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.475

and therefore I haue more neede to see the Law ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.476

and partlye as well for the Instructions of the Jurie , as for my owne
Satisfaction , which mee thinke , were for the Honor of this Presence .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.477

And now if it please you my Lorde Chiefe Justice , I do direct my Speach
specially to you . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.478

What time it pleased the Queenes Majestie , to call you to this
Honourable Office , I did learne of a great Personage of hir Highnesse
Priuie Counsayle , that amongst other good Instructions , hir Majestie
charged and enjoyned you to minister the Law and Justice indifferently
without respect of Persons . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.479

And notwithstanding the old Error amongst you , whiche did not admit any
Witnesse to speake , or any other matter to be hearde in the favor of
the Aduersarie , hir Majestie being partie , hir Highnes pleasure was ,
that whatsoeuer could be brought in the fauor of the Subject , shoulde
be admitted to be hearde . And moreouer , that you specially , and
likewise all other Justices , shoulde not persuade themselues to sit in
Judgment otherwise for hir Highnesse , than for hir Subject .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.480

Therefore this maner of indifferent proceeding being principally
enjoined by Gods Commandement , which I had thought partly to haue
remembred you and others here in Commission in the beginning , if I
might haue had leaue ; and the same also being commanded you by the
Queenes owne Mouth , me think you ought of right to suffer me to haue
the Statutes red openly , and also to reject nothing that coulde be
spoken in my Defence : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.481

and in thus doing you shal shew your selves worthy Ministers , and fit
for so worthie a Mistresse . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.482

<font> Bromley , <$$font> You mistake the matter ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.483

the Queene spake those Wordes to maister <font> Morgan <$$font> Chiefe
Justice of the Common Place ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.484

but you haue no cause to complaine , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.485

for you haue been suffered to talke at your pleasure .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.486

<font> Hare . <$$font> What woulde you doe with the Statute-Booke ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.487

the Jury doth not require it , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.488

they haue hearde the Euidence , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.489

and they must vppon their Conscience trie whether you bee guiltie or no
, so as the Booke needeth not : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.490

if they will not credite the Euidence so apparent , then they know what
they haue to doe . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.491

<font> Cholmley . <$$font> You ought not to haue any Bookes red here at
your Appointment , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.492

for where doth aryse any doubte in the Law , the Judges sitte here to
informe the Court ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.493

and now you doe but spende time . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.494

<font> Attourney . <$$font> I pray you my Lorde Chiefe Justice repeate
the Euidence for the Queene , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C1.495

and giue <P_I,72.C2> the Jurie their Charge ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.496

for the Prisoner will keepe you here all day .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.497

<font> Bromley . <$$font> How saye you , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.498

haue you any more to saye for your selfe ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.499

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> You seeme to giue and offer mee the Lawe
, THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.500

but in very dede I haue only the Forme and Image of the Lawe ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.501

neuerthelesse , since I can@ @not be suffred to haue the Statutes red
openly in the Booke , I will by your Pacience gesse at them , as I may ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.502

and I pray you to help me if I mistake , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.503

for it is long since I did see them . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.504

The Statute of Repeale made the last Parliament hath these Wordes , Be
it enacted by the Queene , that from henceforth none Acte , Deede , or
Offence , being by Acte of Parliament or Statute made Treason , Petit
Treason , or Misprision of Treason , by Words , Writing , Printing ,
Ciphering , Deedes , or otherwise whatsoeuer , shall be taken , had ,
deemed , or adjudged Treason , Petit Treason , but only such as be
declared , or expressed to be Treason , in or by an Acte of Parliament
made in the xxv. Yeare of <font> Edward <$$font> III. touching and
concerning Treasons , and the Declaration of Treasons , and none other .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.505

Here may you see this Statute doth referre all the Offences aforesayde ,
to the Statute of the xxv. of <font> Edward <$$font> III. which
Statute hath these Wordes touching and concerning the Treasons that I am
indited and arraigned of ; that is to saye , Whosoeuer doth compasse or
imagine the Death of the King , or leuie War against the King in his
Realm , or being adherent to the Kings Enimies within this Realme , or
elsewhere , or be thereof probably attained by open Deede by People of
their Condition , shall be adjudged a Traytor .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.506

Now I praye you of my Jurie which haue my Lyfe in Triall , note well
what things at this daye bee Treasons , and howe these Treasons must be
tried and decerned , that is to saye , by open Deede , which the Lawes
doth at some time terme <font> ouert acte <$$font> .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.507

And now I aske , notwithstanding my Inditement , which is but matter
alledged , where doth appeare the open Deede of any compassing or
imagining the Queenes Death ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.508

or where doth appeare any open Deede of being adherent to the Queenes
Enimies , giuing to them ayde and comfort ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.509

or where doth appeare any open Deede of taking the Tower of <font>
Loudon <$$font> ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.510

<font> Bromley . <$$font> Why doe not you of the Queenes learned
Counsell aunswere him ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.511

Me thinke , <font> Throckmorton <$$font> , you neede not to haue the
Statutes , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.512

for you haue them meetely perfectly . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.513

<font> Stanford . <$$font> You are deceyued , to conclude all Treasons
in the Statute of the xxv. Year of <font> Edwarde <$$font> the Thirde ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.514

for that Statute is but a Declaration of certaine Treasons , whiche were
Treasons before at the Common Lawe . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.515

Euen so there doth remayne diuers other Treasons at this day at the
Common Lawe , which be not expressed by that Statute , as the Judges can
declare . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.516

Neuerthelesse , there is matter sufficient alledged and proued against
you to bringe you within the compasse of the same Statute .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.517

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I praye you expresse those Matters that
bring me within the compasse of the Statute of <font> Edwarde <$$font>
the Third ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.518

for the Wordes be these , And be thereof attainted by open Deede by
People of like Condicion . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.519

<font> Bromley . Throckmorton <$$font> , you deceyue your selfe ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.520

and mistake these Wordes , by People of their Condicion ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,72.C2.521

for thereby the Lawe doth vnderstande <P_I,73.C1> the discouering of
your Treasons . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.522

As for example , <font> Wiat <$$font> and the other Rebelles , attainted
for their great Treasons , already declare you to be his and their
adherent , in_as_much as diuerse and sundrie times you had Conference
with him and them aboute the Treason ; so as <font> Wiat <$$font> is now
one of your Condicion , who as all the Worlde knoweth , hath committed
an open trayterous Fact . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.523

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> By your leaue , my Lorde , this is a
very straunge and singular Understanding .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.524

For I suppose the meaning of the Lawe-makers did vnderstande these
Wordes , By People of their Condicion , of the State and Condicion of
those Persons whiche shoulde bee on the Inquest to trie the Partie
arreygned , guiltie or not guiltie , and nothing to be bewraying of the
Offence by another Man's act , as you say :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.525

for what haue I to doe with <font> Wiat's <$$font> actes , that was not
nigh him by one_hundred Myles ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.526

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Will you take vppon you to skill better of
the Lawe than the Judges ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.527

I doubt not but you of the Jurie will credit as it becommeth you .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.528

<font> Cholmley . <$$font> Concerning the true vnderstanding of these
Words , By People of their Condicion , my Lord Chiefe Justice here hath
declared the Truth ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.529

for <font> Wiat <$$font> was one of your Condicion , that is to say , of
your Conspiracie . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.530

<font> Hare . <$$font> You doe not denie , <font> Throckmorton <$$font>
, but that there hath bene Conference , and sending betweene <font> Wiat
<$$font> and you , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.531

and he and <font> Winter <$$font> doth confesse the same , with others ;
so as it is playne , <font> Wiat <$$font> may well be called one of your
Condicion . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.532

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Well , seeing you my Judges rule the
vnderstanding of these Wordes in the Statute , By People of your
Condicion , thus straungelye against mee , I will not stande longer
vppon them . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.533

But where dothe appeare in mee an open Deede , wherevnto the Treason is
speciallye referred ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.534

<font> Bromley . <$$font> If thre or foure do talke , deuise , and
conspire togither of a trayterous Acte to be done , and afterwards one
of them doth commit Treason , as <font> Wiat <$$font> did ; then the
Lawe doth repute them , and euerye of them as their Actes ; so as <font>
Wiat's <$$font> Actes do implie and argue your open Deede ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.535

and so the Lawe doth terme it and take it .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.536

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> These be marueylous Expositions , and
wonderfull Implications , that another Man's acte , whereof I was not
privy , should be accounted myne ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.537

for <font> Wiat <$$font> did purge me that I knew nothing of his stirre
. THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.538

<font> Hare . <$$font> Yea , Sir , but you were a principal Procurer
and Contriuer of <font> Wiat's <$$font> Rebellion , though you were not
with him when he made the stirre . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.539

And as my Lord here hath sayd , the Law always doth adjudge him a
Traytor , who was priuie and doth procure Treason , or any other Man to
committe Treason , or a trayterous acte , as you did <font> Wiat
<$$font> , and others ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.540

for so the Ouert Acte of those whiche did it by your Procurement , shall
in this case be accounted your open Deede .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.541

We have a common case in the Lawe , if one by Procurement shoulde
disseyse you of your Lande , the Lawe holdeth vs both wrong doers ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.542

and giueth remedie as well against the one as the other .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.543

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> For God's sake applie not such
Constructions against me ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.544

and though my present Estate doth not moue you , yet it were well you
shoulde consider your Office , and think what measure you giue to others
, THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.545

you your selues I say shall assuredly receyue the same agayne .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C1.546

<P_I,73.C2>

The state of mortall Life is such , that Men know full little what
hangeth ouer them . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.548

I put on within this xii. Moneths such a Mind , that I moste wofull
Wight , was unlike to stande here , as some of you that sit there .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.549

As to your case last recited , whereby you woulde conclude , I haue
remembred and learned of you Master <font> Hare <$$font> , and you
Master <font> Stanforde <$$font> in the Parliament House , where you did
sit to make Lawes , to expounde and explaine the Ambiguities and Doubtes
of Lawe sincerely , and that without Affections :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.550

There , I say , I learned of you , and others my Maisters of the Lawe ,
this difference betwixt such Cases as you remembred one euen nowe , and
the Statute whereby I am to be tried . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.551

There is a Maxime or Principle in the Lawe , which ought not to be
violated , That no penal Statute may , ought , or shoulde be construed ,
expounded , extended , or wrested , otherwise than the simple Wordes and
nude Letter of the same Statute doth warrant and signifie .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.552

And amongst diuers good and notable Reasons by you there in the
Parliament House debated , Maister Sergeant <font> Stanforde <$$font> ,
I noted this one , why the said Maxime ought to be inuiolable :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.553

you said , considering the priuate Affections many tymes both of Princes
and Ministers within this Realme , for that they were Men , and woulde
and coulde erre , it shoulde be no Securitie , but very daungerous to
the Subject , to referre the Construction , and extending of Penall
Statutes to anye Judges Equitie , as you termed it , which might eyther
by feare of the higher Powers be seduced , or by Ignoraunce and Follye
abused . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.554

And that is an aunswere by procurement . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.555

<font> Bromley . <$$font> Notwithstanding the principle , as you
alledge it , and the precisenesse of your sticking to the bare wordes of
the Statute , it doth appeare and remaine of recorde in our Learning ,
that diuerse Cases haue bene adjudged Treason , without the express
wordes of the Statute , as the Quenes learned Counsell there can declare
. THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.556

<font> Attourney . <$$font> It doth appeare , the Prisoner did not only
intise or procure <font> Wiat , Caroe , Rogers <$$font> , and others ,
to commite their trayterous Actes , and there doth his open factes
appear , whiche <font> Vaughan's <$$font> Confession doth witnesse ; but
also he did mynde shortlye after to associate himselfe with those
Traytours ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.557

for hee minded to haue departed with the Earle of <font> Deuonshire
<$$font> Westwardes . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.558

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> My Innocencie concerning these matters ,
I trust , sufficiently appeareth by my former Aunswers , notwithstanding
the condempned Man's unjust Accusation . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.559

But because the true understanding of the Statute is in question ; I
saye , procurement , and specially by words onely , is without the
compasse of it : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.560

and that I doe learne and proue by the principle which I learned of
Maister <font> Stanforde <$$font> . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.561

<font> Stanforde . <$$font> Maister <font> Throckmorton <$$font> , you
and I maye not agree this Day in the understanding of the Lawe ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.562

for I am for the Queene , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.563

and you speake for your selfe : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.564

the Judges must determine the matter . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.565

<font> Bromley . <$$font> He that doth procure another Man to commit a
Felonie or a Murther , I am sure you know well ynough , the Law doth
adjudge the Procurer there , a Felon or a Murtherer ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.566

and in case of Treason , it hath bene alwayes so taken and reputed .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.567

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I doe and must cleaue to my Innocencie ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,73.C2.568

for I procured no Man to committe <P_I,74.C1> Treason ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.569

but yet for my Learning I desire to heare some case so ruled , when the
Lawe was as it is nowe . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.570

I do confesse it , that at suche time there were Statutes prouided for
the procurer , counsaylour , ayder , abetter , and suche like , as there
were in King <font> Henrie <$$font> the VIIIth@ @'s tyme , you might
lawfullye make this cruell Construction , and bring the procurer within
the compasse of the Lawe . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.571

But these Statutes being repealed , you ought not nowe so to doe ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.572

and as to the principal procurer in Fellonie and Murther , it is not
lyke as in Treason , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.573

for the Principal and Accessaries in Felonie and Murther be triable and
punishable by the common Law ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.574

and so in those cases the Judges may use their Equitie , extending the
determinacion of the fault as they thinke good :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.575

but in Treason it is otherwise , the same being limited by Statute Law ,
which I say and aduow is restreyned from any Judges Construction by the
Maxime that I recited . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.576

<font> Stanforde . <$$font> Your Lordships do know a case in R. 3.
time , where the Procurer to counterfeyt false Money , was judged a
Traytor , and the Law was as it is now . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.577

<font> Hare . <$$font> Maister Sergeaunt doth remember you <font>
Throckmorton <$$font> , of an Experience before our time , that the Lawe
hath bene so taken , and yet the procurer was not expressed in the
Statute , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.578

but the Lawe hath ben always so taken . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.579

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I neuer studied the Law , wherof I do
much repent mee ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.580

yet I remember , whylest Penall Statutes were talked of in the
Parliament-House , you the learned Men of the House remembred some Cases
contrarie to this last spoken of . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.581

And if I misreport them , I pray you helpe me .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.582

In the like case you speake of concerning the Procurer to counterfeyte
false Money ; at one time the Procurer was judged a Fellon , and at
another time neither Fellon nor Traytor ; so as some of your
Predecessours adjudged the Procurer no Traytour in the same case , but
leaned to their principle , though some other extende their
Constructions too large . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.583

And here is two cases with me , for one against me .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.584

<font> Bromley . <$$font> Bicause you replie so sore upon the principle
, I will remember , where one taking the Great Seale of <font> Englande
<$$font> from one Writing , and putting it to another , was adjudged a
Traytour in <font> Henry <$$font> the IVth@ @'s tyme , and yet his act
was not within the expresse words of the Statute of <font> Edwarde
<$$font> the Third . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.585

There be diuerse other such like cases that maye be alledged and need
were . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.586

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I pray you my Lord Chiefe Justice , call
to your good Remembraunce , that in the selfe_same case of the Seale ,
Justice <font> Spilman <$$font> , a graue and well learned Man , since
that time , woulde not condemn the Offender , but did reproue that
former Judgment by you last remembred , as erronious .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.587

<font> Stanforde . <$$font> If I had thought you had bene so well
furnished with Booke Cases , I woulde haue bene better prouided for you
. THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.588

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I haue nothing but I lerned of you
specially M. Sergeant , and of others my Masters of the Law in the
Parliament House ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.589

and therefore I may say with the Prophet , Salutem ex inimicis nostris .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.590

<font> Southwell . <$$font> You have a very good Memorie .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.591

<font> Attorney . <$$font> If the Prisoner may auoyde his Treasons
after this maner , the Queenes Suretie shall bee in great jeoperdy .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C1.592

For <font> Jack Cade <$$font> , the Blacksmith , and diuerse other
Traytors , sometime alledging the Law for them , sometime they ment no
harm <P_I,74.C2> to the King , but against his Counsell ; as <font> Wiat
<$$font> , the Duke of <font> Suffolke <$$font> , and these did against
the <font> Spanyardes <$$font> , when there was no <font> Spanyardes
<$$font> within the Realme . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.593

The Duke and his Brethren did mistake the Lawe , as you doe ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.594

yet at length did confesse their Ignorance ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.595

and submitted themselves . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.596

And so were you best to doe . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.597

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> As to <font> Cade <$$font> and the
Blacksmith , I am not so well acquainted with their Treasons as you bee
; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.598

but I haue red in the Chronicle , they were in the Fielde with a force
against the Prince , whereby a manifest acte did appeare .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.599

As to the Duke of <font> Suffolke@ @'s <$$font> doings , they appertaine
not to mee . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.600

And tho you woulde compare my speache and talke against the <font>
Spanyardes <$$font> , to the Duke's actes , who assembled a force in
Armes , it is euident they differ much : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.601

I am sorie to engreue any other Mans doings ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.602

but it serueth me for a piece of my Defence ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.603

and therefore I wish that no Man should gather euil of it ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.604

God forbid that words and acts be thus confounded .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.605

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Sir <font> William Stanley <$$font> used
this shifte that the Prisoner useth now , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.606

he sayde he did not leuie War against King <font> Henry <$$font> the
VII. THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.607

but sayde to the Duke of <font> Buckingham <$$font> , that in a good
Quarrell he wold aid him with 500 Men ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.608

and neverthelesse <font> Stanley <$$font> was for those Words attainted
, who , as all the Worlde knoweth , had before that time serued the King
very faithfully and truly . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.609

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> I pray you Maister Attorney do not
conclude me by blinde contraries . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.610

Whether you alledge <font> Stanleyes <$$font> case trulye or no , I
knowe not . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.611

But admitte it be as you saye , what dothe this proue against me ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.612

I promised no ayde to Maister <font> Wiat <$$font> , nor to anye other .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.613

The Duke of <font> Buckingham <$$font> leuied Warre against the King ,
with whom <font> Stanley <$$font> was confederate so to doe , as you
saye . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.614

<font> Attorney . <$$font> I pray you , my Lords , that be the Queenes
Commissioners , suffer not the Prisoner to vse the Queenes learned
Counsell thus ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.615

I was neuer interrupted thus in my Life , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.616

nor I neuer knewe any thus suffered to talke , as this Prisoner is
suffered : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.617

some of us will come no more at the Barre , and we be thus handled .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.618

<font> Bromley . Throckmorton <$$font> , you must suffer the Queenes
learned Counsell to speake , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.619

or else we must take order with you ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.620

you haue had leaue to talke at your pleasure .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.621

<font> Hare . <$$font> It is proued that you did talke with <font> Wiat
<$$font> against the comming of the <font> Spanyardes <$$font> , and
deuised to interrupt their arrivall , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.622

and you promised to doe what you coulde againste them ; wherevpon <font>
Wiat <$$font> being encouraged by you , did levie a force , and
attempted Warre against the Queenes Royal Person .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.623

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> It was no Treason , nor no procurement
of Treason , to talke agaynste the comming hither of the <font>
Spanyardes <$$font> , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.624

neyther it was Treason for me to saye , I woulde hynder their commyng
hither as muche as I coulde , vnderstanding me rightly as I meant it ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.625

yea though you would extend it to the worste , it was but Words ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.626

it was not Treason at this day as the Law standeth :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.627

and as for <font> Wiat's <$$font> doings , they touche me nothing ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.628

for at his Death , when it was no tyme to report untruly , he purged me
. THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,74.C2.629

<font> Bromley . <$$font> By sundry Cases remembred here by the Queenes
learned Counsell , as you have hearde , that procurement which did
appear no otherwyse but by Words , and those you would make nothing ,
hath bin of long tyme , and by sundry <P_I,75.C1> well learned Men in
the Lawes adjudged Treason . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.630

And therefore your procurement being so euident as it is , we may
lawfully say it was Treason , bycause <font> Wiat <$$font> perfourmed a
trayterous acte . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.631

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> As to the said alledged fore Precedents
against me , I haue recited as many for me ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.632

and I would you my Lord Chief Justice shuld incline your Judgements
rather after the example of your honourable Predecessors , Justice
<font> Markham <$$font> , and others , which did eschewe corrupte
Judgements , judging directly and sincerely after the Law , and the
Principles in the same , than after such Men , as swaruing from the
Truth , the Maxime , and the Law , did judge corruptely , maliciously ,
and affectionately . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.633

<font> Bromley . <$$font> Justice <font> Markham <$$font> had reason to
warrant his doings ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.634

for it did appeare , a Merchant of <font> London <$$font> was arraigned
and slanderously accused of Treason for compassing and imagining the
King's Death , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.635

he did say he would make his Sonne Heire of the Crown ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.636

and the Merchant meant it of a House in <font> Cheapside <$$font> at the
Signe of the <font> Crowne <$$font> ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.637

but your case is not so . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.638

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> My Case doth differ , I graunt , but
specially bicause I haue not suche a Judge :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.639

yet there is another cause to restraine these your strange and
extraordinarie Constructions ; that is to say , a Prouiso in the latter
ende of the Statute of <font> Edwarde <$$font> the Thirde , hauyng these
Wordes : Provided always , if any other Case of supposed Treason shall
chaunce hereafter to come in Question or Trial before any Justice ,
other than is in the said Statute expressed , that then the Justice
shall forbear to adjudge the sayd case , untill it be shewed to the
Parliament to trie , whether it should be Treason or Felonie .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.640

Here you are restrained by expresse Words to adjudge any case that is
not manifestly mentioned before , and untill it be shewed to the
Parliament . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.641

<font> Portman . <$$font> That Prouiso I understand of cases , that may
come in trial , which hath bin in vre , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.642

but the Law hath always taken the Procurer to be a principal Offender .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.643

<font> Sanders . <$$font> The Law alwayes in cases of Treason dothe
accompte all Principalles , and no Accessaries as in other Offences ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.644

and therefore a Man offending in Treason , either by couert acte or
procurement , whereupon an open Deede hath ensued , as in this case , is
adjudged by the Lawe a principal Traytoure .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.645

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> You adjudge <paren> mee thinke <$$paren>
Procurement very hardly , besydes the Principall , and besides the good
Example of your best and most godly learned Predecessors , the Judges of
the Realme , as I haue partly declared ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.646

and notwithstanding thys grieuous racking and extending of this worde
Procurement , I am not in the daunger of it ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.647

for it doth appear by no Deposition , that I procured neyther one or
other to attempt any acte . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.648

<font> Stanforde . <$$font> The Jurie haue to trye , whether it bee so
or no , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.649

let it weygh as it will . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.650

<font> Hare . <$$font> I knowe no Meane so apparent to try Procurement
as by Words , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.651

and that Meane is probable ynoughe agaynst you , as well by youre owne
Confession , as by other Mennes Depositions .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.652

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> To talke of the Queenes Maryage with the
Prince of <font> Spayne <$$font> , and also the commyng hyther of the
<font> Spanyardes <$$font> is not to procure Treason to be done ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.653

for then the whole Parliament-house , I meane the common House , didde
procure Treason : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C1.654

but since you wyll make no Difference <P_I,75.C2> betwixte Wordes and
Actes , I praye you remember an Estatute made in my late Soueraigne
Lorde and Maisters tyme , Kyng <font> Edward <$$font> the Sixth , whiche
apparently expresseth the Difference ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.655

these bee the woordes : Who so euer dothe compasse , or imagine to
depose the Kyng of his Royall Estate by open Preaching , expresse Wordes
or Sayings , shall for the fyrst Offence lose and forfayte to the King
all his and their Goodes and Cattailes , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.656

and also shal suffer Imprisonmente of their Bodyes at the King's Will
and Pleasure . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.657

Whosoeuer , &c. for the second Offence shall lose and forfayte to the
Kyng the whole Issues and Profytes of all his or their Landes ,
Tenementes , and other Hereditaments , Benefices , Prebendes , and other
spiritual Promotions . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.658

Whosoeuer , &c. for the thirde Offence , shall for Term of Lyfe or
Lyues of suche Offendour or Offendors , &c.
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.659

and shall also forfeite to the Kynges Majestie all his or their Goodes
and Cattailes , and suffer during his or their Liues perpetuall
Imprisonement of his or their Bodies . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.660

But whosoeuer , &c. by Writing , Ciphering , or Acte , shall for the
firste Offence be adjudged a Traitour , and suffer the Paines of Deathe
. THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.661

Here you may perceiue howe the whole Realme and all your Judgementes
hathe beefore this vnderstande Wordes and Actes , diuerslye and
apparantlye ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.662

and therefore the Judgementes of the Parliamente did assigne Diuersitie
of Punishmentes , because they woulde not confounde the true
Vnderstanding of Wordes and Deedes , appointing for compassing and
imagining by Worde , Imprisonment ; and for compassing and imagining by
open Deede , Paines of Death . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.663

<font> Bromley . <$$font> It is agreed by the whole Bench , that the
Procurer and the Adherent be deemed alwayes Traytors , when as a
trayterous Acte was committed by anye one of the same Conspiracie ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.664

and there is apparent Proofe of youre adhering to <font> Wiat <$$font> ,
both by your owne Confession and other wayes .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.665

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Adhering and procuring bee not all one ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.666

for the Statute of <font> Edwarde <$$font> the Thirde doth speake of
adhering , but not of procuring , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.667

and yet adhering ought not be further extended , than to the Quenes
Enimies within her Realme , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.668

for so the Statute doth limit the Vnderstanding .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.669

And <font> Wiat <$$font> was not the Queenes Enimie ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.670

for hee was not so reputed , when I talked with him last ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.671

and our Speach implyed no Enmitie , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.672

neyther tended to anye Treason , or procuring of Treason :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.673

and therefore I praye you of the Jurie note , thoughe I argue the Lawe ,
I alledge my Innocencie , as the best part of my Defence .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.674

<font> Hare . <$$font> Your adhering to the Queenes Enimies within the
Realme is euidently proued : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.675

for <font> Wiat <$$font> was the Queenes Enimie wythin the Realme , as
the whole Realme knoweth it , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.676

and he hath confessed it , both at his Arrainement and at his Death .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.677

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> By your leaue , neither <font> Wiat
<$$font> at {SIC:at_at} his Arreignment , nor at his Death , did
confesse , that he was the Queenes Enimie , when I talked last with him
, THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.678

neyther he was reputed nor taken in xiiij. dayes after , vntill he
assembled a Force in Armes , what time I was at your House , Master
<font> Inglefielde <$$font> , where I learned the first Intelligence of
<font> Wiats <$$font> Stirre . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.679

And I aske you , who doth depose that there passed anye maner of
Aduertisement betwixt <font> Wiat <$$font> and mee , after he had
discouered his Doings , and shewed himselfe an Enemie ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,75.C2.680

If <P_I,76.C1> I had bene so disposed , who did let mee , that I did not
repaire to <font> Wiat <$$font> , or to sende to him , or to the Duke of
<font> Suffolke <$$font> eyther , who was in myne owne Countrey ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.681

and thither I might haue gone and conueyed my selfe with him ,
vnsuspected for my departing homewards . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.682

<font> Inglefielde . <$$font> It is true that you were there at my
House , accompanied with others your Brethren , and , to my knowledg ,
ignorant of these Matters . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.683

<font> Bromley . Throckmorton <$$font> , you confessed you talked with
<font> Wiat <$$font> and others against the comming of the <font>
Spanyardes <$$font> , and of the taking of the <font> Tower <$$font> of
<font> London <$$font> ; wherevpon <font> Wiat <$$font> levied a Force
of Men against the <font> Spanyardes <$$font> he sayde ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.684

and so you saye all , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.685

but in Deede it was against the Queene , which he confessed at length :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.686

therefore <font> Wiats <$$font> Actes doe proue you Counsayler and
Procurer , howsoeuer you woulde auoyde the matter .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.687

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Me think you would conclude me with a
mishapen Argument in Logicke , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.688

and you will giue mee leaue , I will make another .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.689

<font> Stanforde . <$$font> The Judges sit not here to make
Disputations , but to declare the Law , which hath bene sufficiently
done , if you woulde consider it . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.690

<font> Hare . <$$font> You haue hearde Reason and the Lawe , if you
will conceyue it . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.691

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Oh mercifull God !
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.692

Oh eternall Father , which seest all things , what maner of Proceedings
are these ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.693

To what purpose serueth the Statute of Repeale the last Parliament ,
where I hearde some of you here present , and diuerse other of the
Queenes learned Counsayle , grieuouslye inuey against the cruell and
bloudie Lawes of King <font> Henrie <$$font> the Eyght , and against
some Lawes made in my late Sovereigne Lorde and Maisters time , King
<font> Edwarde <$$font> the sixth ? THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.694

some termed them <font> Draco's Lawes <$$font> , whiche were written in
Bloude : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.695

Some sayde they were more intolerable than any Lawes , that <font>
Dionysius <$$font> or any other Tyraunt made .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.696

In conclusion , as many Men , so manye bitter Termes and Names those
Lawes had . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.697

And moreouer , the Preface of the same Estatute doth recite , that for
Wordes onely , many great Personages , and others of good Behauiour ,
hath bene most cruelly cast awaye by these foremer sanguinolent thirstie
Lawes , with many other Suggestions for the Repeale of the same .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.698

And now let vs put on indifferent Eyes , and throughly consider with our
selues , as you the Judges handle the Constructions of the Statute of
<font> Edwarde <$$font> the Thirde , with your Equitie and Extensions ,
whether we be not in much wors Case now than we were when those cruel
Lawes yoked vs . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.699

These Lawes albeit they were grieuous and captious , yet they had the
verie Propertie of a Lawe after S. <font> Paules <$$font> Description :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.700

For those Lawes did admonish vs , and discover our Sinnes plainly vnto
vs ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.701

and when a Man is warned , hee is halfe armed .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.702

These Lawes , as they bee handled , be very Baytes to catche vs , and
onely prepared for the same , and no Lawes ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.703

for at the first sight they ascertaine vs we be deliuered from our olde
Bondage , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.704

and by the late Repeale the last Parliament we liue in more Securitie .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.705

But when it pleaseth the higher Powers to call any Mannes Lyfe and
Sayings in question , then there be Constructions , Interpretations ,
and Extensions reserued to the Justices and Judges Equitie , that the
Partie triable , as I am nowe , shall finde himselfe in much worse case
, than before when those cruell Lawes stoode in force .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C1.706

Thus our Amendement <P_I,76.C2> is from God's Blessing into the warme
Sunne ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.707

but I require you honest Men , whiche are to trie my Life , consider
these Opinions of my Life : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.708

Judges be rather agreeable to the Time , than to the Truth ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.709

for their Judgments be repugnant to their owne Principle , repugnant to
their godly and best learned Predecessors Opinions , repugnant , I say ,
to the Prouiso in the Statute of Repeale made in the last Parliament .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.710

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Maister <font> Throckmorton <$$font> , quiet
your selfe , and it shall be the better for you .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.711

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Maister <font> Attorney <$$font> , I am
not so vnquiet as you be , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.712

and yet our Cases are not alike ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.713

but bicause I am so tedious to you , and haue long troubled this
Presence , it may please my Lorde Chief Justice to repeate the Euidence
, wherewith I am charged , and my Aunswers to all the Objections , if
there be no other matter to laye against me .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.714

Then the Chief Justice <font> Bromley <$$font> remembred particularly
all the Depositions and Euidences giuen against the Prisoner ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.715

and eyther for wante of good Memorie , or good Will , the Prisoners
Aunsweres were in part not recited : wherevppon the Prisoner craued
Indifferencie , and did helpe the Judges olde Memorie with his owne
Recital . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.716

<font> Sendall . <$$font> My Maisters of the Jurie , you haue to
inquire , whether Sir <font> Nicholas Throckmorton <$$font> Knight ,
here Prisoner at the Barre be guiltie of these Treasons , or any of them
, whereof he hath bene indited and this daye arreigned , yea or no :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.717

And if you finde him guiltie , you shall enquire what Landes ,
Tenementes , Goodes , and Cattelles he had at the day of his Treasons
committed , or at anye time since ; and whether he fledde for the
Treasons or no , if you finde him not guiltie .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.718

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Haue you sayde what is to be sayd ?
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.719

<font> Sendall . <$$font> Yea , for this time .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.720

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> Then I pray you giue me leaue to speake
a fewe Words to the Jurie : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.721

The Weyght and Grauitie of my Cause hath greatly occasioned me to
trouble you here long , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.722

and therfore I minde not to intertain you here long with any prolixe
Oration : THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.723

You perceyue notwithstanding this daye great Contention betwixt the
Judges and the Queenes learned Counsayle on the one partie , and mee the
poore and wofull Prisoner on the other partie . The Triall of our whole
Controuersie , the Triall of my Innocencie , the Triall of my Lyfe ,
Landes , and Goodes , and the Destruction of my Posteritie for euer ,
doth rest in your good Judgements . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.724

And albeit many this daye haue greatly inveyghed against me , the finall
Determination thereof is transferred onely to you :
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.725

howe grieuous and horrible the shedding of Innocents Bloude is in the
sight of Almightie God , I trust you doe remember .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.726

Therefore take heede , I saye , for Christes sake ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.727

do not defile your Consciences with such heynous and notable Crimes ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.728

they bee grieuouslye and terriblye punished , as in this Worlde and Vale
of Miserie vpon the Childrens Children to the thirde and fourth
Generation , and in the worlde to come with euerlasting Fire and
Damnation . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.729

Lift up your Minds to God , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.730

and care not too muche for the Worlde ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.731

looke not backe to the Fleshpots of <font> Egypte <$$font> , whiche will
allure you from heauenly Respectes to worldlye Securitie , and can
thereof neyther make you anye Suretie . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.732

Beleeue , I pray you , the Queene and hir Magistrates be more delighted
with favourable Equitie , than with rashe Crueltie ;
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,76.C2.733

and in that you be al Citizens , <P_I,77.C1> I will take my leaue of you
with S. <font> Paules <$$font> farewell to the <font> Ephesians
<$$font> , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,77.C1.734

Citizens also you be , whome he tooke to recorde that he was pure from
shedding any Bloude ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,77.C1.735

a special Token , a Doctrine left for your Instruction , that euerye of
you may washe his Handes of Innocents Bloudeshedde , when you shall take
your leaue of this wretched Worlde ; THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,77.C1.736

the Holy Ghost be amongst you . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,77.C1.737

<font> Sendall . <$$font> Come hither , Sergeaunt ,
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,77.C1.738

take the Jurye with you , THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,77.C1.739

and suffer no Man to come at them , but to be order'd as the Lawe
appointeth , vntill they be agreed vpon their Verdit .
THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,77.C1.740

<font> Throckmorton . <$$font> It may please you my Lordes and Maisters
which be Commissioners , to give order , that no Person haue Access or
Conference with the Jurie , neither that any of the Queenes learned
Counsayle be suffered to repayre to them , or to talke with any of them
, vntil they present themselues here in open Court , to publish their
Verdit . THROCKM-1554-E1-H,I,77.C1.741
