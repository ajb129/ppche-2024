<$$heading>

<font> Jo. <$$font> Be not angry my dear , PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.8

if thou hast not a Smock to thy back I would have thee ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.9

but in knowing what each other hath , we shall know the better how to
improve it , PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.10

do thou the same by me . PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.11

<font> Ka. <$$font> Truly I have but ten pounds my father left me ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.12

and that is in my Uncle Hodge@ @'s hands . PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.13

<font> Jo. <$$font> T@ @is sure I hope . PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.14

and five pound I have gathered since I came to service ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.17

besides my Mistress owes me above half a years wages .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.18

<font> Jo. <$$font> O what a happy man shall I be ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.19

what a good housewife thou hast been , PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.20

<font> Jo. <$$font> Now Kate I will tell thee what I have ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.23

my father gave me ten pounds when I came from him ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.24

and told me as I did improve that , he would give me more ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.25

and with my Masters leave , I have imployed it in his Mault-house ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.26

and have encreased it ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.27

besides my master doth owe me my wages ever since I came to him ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.28

he would not let me have it for fear I should play the ill husband ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.29

and if I please him , I know he will give me something when I marry ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.30

and so will thy Mistriss , will she not ? PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.31

<font> Ka. <$$font> I hope so too . PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.32

<font> Jo. <$$font> Now for the best advantage , thy stock and mine
together , will amount to something ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.33

and when we have concluded our marriage day , i@ @le try if my Master
will let me have a little house and ground thou knowest hard by William
Jacksons , PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.34

that will make a great house for us , PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.35

<font> Ka. <$$font> And a great Rent too , PENNY-1686-E3-H,116.36

PENNY-1686-E3-H,117.42

and if thou wilt help me a little , it will be the better ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,117.43

for two heads are better than one , PENNY-1686-E3-H,117.44

we must not take care only for sleeping places , but a place to get mony
in . PENNY-1686-E3-H,117.45

leave , PENNY-1686-E3-H,117.53

and there is pasture enough to keep two beasts , and conveniences for
hogs and poultery , PENNY-1686-E3-H,117.54

like a Lady . PENNY-1686-E3-H,117.55

<font> Ka. <$$font> This will be brave indeed John ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,117.56

nay , the Light within does say unto me , That Mary is a Sister , and
that Gods Lambs may play , so that they can but keep it secret from the
Wicked ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,147.164

therefore Satan , though I defie thee and all thy Works , yet will I go
in unto Mary as I have said : PENNY-1686-E3-H,147.165

Mary , why Mary , I say unto thee Mary . PENNY-1686-E3-H,147.166

<font> Ma. <$$font> Yea , verily ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,147.175

going to instruct our Friends . PENNY-1686-E3-H,147.177

thou art a Sanctified Sister , and one of the Infallible Congregation ;
PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.191

and as for thy Dame , I say she is departed ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.192

therefore Mary , again I say unto thee , that the Spirit within does

Hast not thee declared among the Brethren , that it shall not be lawful
for a Sister to defile her self ? PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.201

<font> Qua. <$$font> Yea , with the prophaned I hold it is not Lawful ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.202

but dost thou conceive that Saints can play with each other ?
PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.203

nay , for I say unto thee , if thou dost not thou art not a Sanctified
Sister : PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.204

PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.215

<font> Quak. <$$font> Thou canst not Err , PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.216

therefore prepare thy Vessel to receive the motions that approach unto
thy Tabernacle . PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.217

<font> Ma. <$$font> Yea , now thy Wickedness is entred
PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.218

and has put out all the Light within , PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.219

nay , now I am left in darkness , PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.220

and thou mayest proceed , PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.221

now I swim in delight , PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.222

O the happiness of us Saints above the rest of the Wicked .

<font> Q. <$$font> Yea , Mary , thou hast even said ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,148.224

can be wrought upon to act Carnally like the Wicked .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,149.232

O the War that it raises between the Flesh and the Spirit !
PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.267

Light within prevailed against him , by yea and by nay , thou wouldst
have thought me all in a Feavor , PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.268

O how strong he prevails ! PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.272

exhort them , nay , all our friends , to pray for a falling Brother ,
that Satan may not buffet him . PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.293

<font> M. <$$font> Yea , yea , I shall administer according as thou

<font> Qua. <$$font> O good Wife make haste , PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.295

the Flesh grows stronger , PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.296

I say unto thee again , make haste , PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.297

<paren> She goes out . <$$paren> PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.301

<font> Qua. <$$font> Now Mary I plainly say , thy Dame is again

<font> M. <$$font> Yes , verily , thy Hand-maid doth see ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.303

and how easily good Woman , she is deceiv'd by the working of the Inward
man ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.304

nay , Master , Master , 't@ @is enough , PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.305

I dare not wrong my Dame too much , PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.306

reserve some refreshment for our Sister Sarah . PENNY-1686-E3-H,150.307

<P_151>

<font> Qua. <$$font> By yea and nay , I say unto thee Mary , by reason
she hath kept all her Light within , and held none forth till now of
late , it has dryed her up , nay , burnt her to a Charcole ;
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.309

and again I say unto thee , she is stricken in years ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.310

and regardeth not the Flesh , PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.311

therefore Mary , I say I must , PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.312

nay , I will , PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.313

and if thou deniest the refreshing of a Brother , thou are not worthy to
be called a Sister . PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.314

<font> M. <$$font> Nay , I even see thou are resolved
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.315

and I shall not at this time resist thy good motion ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.316

nay , thou mayest do if it shall so please thee .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.317

<font> Qua. <$$font> Yea , I shall . PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.318

<font> Ma. <$$font> But by yea and nay , if thine Hand-maid prove with
Child , what must be done with the sanctified Babe ?
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.319

<font> Qua. <$$font> I answer thee , I shall send it to some of our
Friends at Clapham , there to be instructed by a Holy Sister , so that
the prophaned shall not be able to reproach our Congregation with the
same . PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.320

<font> Ma. <$$font> Then I plainly answer thee again ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.321

and say , that thine Hand-maid shall as often as the Spirit moves , so
that Sarah nor none of the Wicked observe , prepare her Vessel to
receive thy refreshments : PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.322

but now Sarah is returned from the Brethren , PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.323

I hear her voice PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.324

and must be gone , PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.325

or she will observe my rumpled Handkerchief . PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.326

<font> Qua. <$$font> Yea , thou sayest well , PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.327

but lay it by PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.328

and here is another , PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.329

depart not , PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.330

I say depart not . PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.331

<font> Dame . <$$font> O Husband , Husband , pray how is it ;
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.332

is the Outward man yet quiet ? PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.333

O had you heard the Brethren groan , and Holy Sisters weep , when I
speak , and said that you were fallen from the Light .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.334

<font> Qua. <$$font> Yea , verily they have prevailed ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.335

Satan is departed for this time , PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.336

and thou mayest thank thy Hand-maid too , PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.337

for she , like a pious Sister , has been very diligent since thy
departure . PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.338

<font> Dame . <$$font> Yea , I say unto thee , I shall thank her ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.339

O Mary , I shall ever commend thee for a sanctified Sister among our
friends , PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.340

and now let all our mourning be turned into joy ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.341

yea , we will sing a Hymn for joy the inward Man has wrastled and
prevailed . PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.342

<font> Qua. <$$font> Yea , yea , Sarah ; if thou wilt begin , I and thy
Maid will bear our parts , in spight of all the Wicked ...
PENNY-1686-E3-H,151.343

<P_152>

<font> Dame . <$$font> Now let us part , and rejoyce with our Friends
for the Mastery , that the inward Light has obtained over the Carnal ,
and that thou art not fallen like one of the Wicked .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,152.345

<font> Qua. <$$font> Yea verily , as thou hast said , so it shall even
come to pass ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,152.346

Come Mary , we will depart unto the Congregation of those Saints that be
of our Notions . PENNY-1686-E3-H,152.347

A Young Man and Maid living in Kent , being in Love together , but
Marriage deferr'd by their Friends , by reason of the inequality in the
Maidens Portion : they resolved to steal some private embraces ,
contrary to their Parents knowledge . PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.374

And it fell out , they met together at Canterbury , that being a place
pretty far from home , and not much acquainted .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.375

There they took Lodgings at a certain Inn : PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.376

but the Man having some small business in the City , fell into Company ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.377

and night approaching , the young Maid waiting with patience ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.378

and no Lover came , PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.379

ten a clock strikes , PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.380

up stairs she goes , admiring to the House , that her pretended Husband
did not come ; desiring to have a little Sack Posset , thinking he might
eat some after his Journey . PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.381

That was made , brought up , and set on the Cupboards head with a Candle
lighted , PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.382

she being tyred , goes to Bed PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.383

and there waits the happy hour , of her Lovers coming :
PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.384

Now you must understand , there comes a Bearheard , that had been newly
landed in the Downs , with three lusty Bears ; which being late was
plac'd in a Stable-Room , just under the floor where the Lovers was to
enjoy themselves : PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.385

but one of the Bears winding the Sack Posset ; begins to roar ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.386

when scratching the wall and finding it yield , made a large hole just
in the stair-case , PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.387

gets through PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.388

and up stairs he comes into the Chamber , where the Maid was then fallen
asleep ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,157.389

the Bear mounting his two fore-feet on the Cubbord , to get to the
Sack-Posset his claws hung so in the Cubbord-cloath that he pulls down
the Sack Posset , Candle and all , upon him <P_158> which noise awakened
the young Maid , who thinking her Lover was come , started up on a
sudden , PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.390

but seeing a hairy thing all on fire as the Bear was , by the Candles
falling upon him : she hid her self under the Bed-cloaths ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.391

the Bear by rouling about , at length put out the fire on his back ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.392

and falls to licking up the Posset ; which at length , so intoxicated
his Brain , that being disposed to sleep , he leaps on the bed ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.393

and their lyes ; the fright whereof , caused our young VVoman to let fly
behind . PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.394

In the interim comes in her Lover , who ascending the stairs , half
fluster'd , falls on the Bed , hugging the Bear instead of his
sweetheart ; and begging her Pardon for his long stay :
PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.395

but he scented such a smell of bak'd , boyl'd , stew'd and Roasted ,
that he knew not what to think of it ; calling out , my Dear , my Dear ,
why doest not speak ? when in the midst of all this Freak , the
Bearheard miss'd his Bear , and looking for him , found the hole , where
he had made his escape ; comes up stairs with a lighted Torch , and
three or four belonging to the Inn , discovered the whole intrigue , to
the no small shame of the two Amoretta's . PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.396

At a Coffee-house in Canterbury , several Gentlemen were together ;
PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.398

one was asking what news they heard from London ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.399

why reply'd , another ; there was forty_thousand Men rose yesterday
morning , which made them all to wonder , and ask if he knew for what ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.400

yes sayd he , only to goe to Bed when night came : which occasion'd a
great laughter . PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.401

<heading:edcomment:6>

In Canterbury , there was a Carpenter that had married a handsome young
wife ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.403

and he had a Gentleman that had boarded with him , that pretended to
study Astrology ; but no otherwise than to gull the Husband and lye with
his VVife , who had promised him that favour , if he could beguile the
Carpenter . PENNY-1686-E3-H,158.404

Now this Gentleman had a Rival , that had a months mind to have a lick
at her <P_159> Honey-pot , PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.405

but she hated him PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.406

and loved her Boarder . PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.407

It happened that the Carpenter miss'd his Boarder upon a time ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.408

and searching about , found him in a Cock-loft , looking up toward the
Skie : PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.409

what@ @'s the matter , quoth he ? PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.410

Oh says the Gentleman , I find by Astrology that on Monday next at
quarter-night , there will fall such a Prodigious Rain that Noah's Flood
was not half so great ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.411

therefore get quickly three Bucking-Tubs that we may get into them ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.412

and tye them to the top of the Garret , that we may save our Lives :
PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.413

the Carpenter quak'd for fear , PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.414

got three Tubs , PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.415

and at night , he and his wife and the boarder , climb a Ladder
PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.416

and severally get in . PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.417

After much sighing , the Carpenter falls asleep ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.418

and the Gentleman and the Landlady , merrily marches to their intended
business : PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.419

but while they were at it , the Rival knocks at the door
PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.420

and entreats her to grant him a Kiss ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.421

now , said she to the Boarder , you shall laugh your fill :
PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.422

my Dearest quoth she , come close to the window , and I will be with you
immediately : PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.423

the Rival wipes his mouth to receive the kiss . PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.424

At length , she opens the VVindow , PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.425

and desires what he does to do quickly : PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.426

now the night was very dark , PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.427

and she felt about till she found him , PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.428

and to tell the Tale neither better nor worse ; he very savourly kiss'd
her bare Arse . PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.429

The Rival cruelly vext ; got a red_hot iron , PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.430

and comes again , tell her he had brought her a Ring , provided she
would give him another kiss ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.431

and the Boarder thinking to encrease the sport , places his Arse out at
the same window ; which his Rival did singe and burn , that he cried out

Noah's Flood was come , starts on a sudden , out of the Bucking-Tub ,

A VVoman sitting with Fish in Canterbury Market , would always have a
saying to Men when they came to buy any thing : PENNY-1686-E3-H,159.434

As a <P_160> Man was cheapning her Fish , says she to him , as you
intend to have some of my Fish in your Belly , so I would fain have some
of your Flesh in my Belly ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.435

no says he , I ca@ @n't spare my Flesh to such an ugly Puss as you :
PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.436

No , No , reply'd she , I did not mean as you mean ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.437

I mean your nose in my Arse . PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.438

A beautiful young Gentlewoman of Canterbury , being wedded to an old Man
in respect of his Riches , he being as full of Ice , as she of Fire ,
had a mind to try the difference between young and old Flesh ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.440

shewed some Kindness more than ordinary to her Serving-man ; which he
perceiving , lays hold of all Opportunities to address himself to her by
way of Love ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.441

but she would not yield to his Desire , unless he would contrive some
way to cornute her Husband in his presence and he not to believe it ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.442

this caused the Serving-man to stretch his Invention upon the Rack , who
at last acquainted his Mistress that he had found an Experiment to do it
, provided she would when her Husband and she was a walking in the
Garden , pretend to Long for some Fruit on some of the highest Trees ,
and to leave to him the management of the rest , which accordingly she
did : PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.443

The old Man calling his Man to ascend the Tree to gather the Fruit ;
which , as soon as he had got up , cryed out with a loud Voice , Master
, Master , leave off for shame , PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.444

I never in all my life see so unseemly an Action ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.445

for shame disengage your self from my Mistress , or else some of the
Neighbours will see you : PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.446

the old Man amazed at this Language , asked if the Fellow was mad , and
what he meant ? PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.447

O Sir , said the Man , the Tree is either bewitched ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.448

or else I can@ @not believe mine own Eyes ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.449

for I fancy I see you upon my Mistress . PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.450

Come down , PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.451

come down , PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.452

and let me get up the Tree to know if , it seems so to me ;
PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.453

the Fellow comes down PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.454

and the old Man gets up : PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.455

in the Interim , the young Fellow fell to work with his Mistress ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.456

the old Man looks down PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.457

and sees it , PENNY-1686-E3-H,160.458

<P_161>

cries out , PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.460

in good Faith says he , it seems to me just as it did to you ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.461

for me@ @thinks I see you upon your Mistress as perfectly as if it was
really so : PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.462

the old Man gets down PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.463

and thinks the Tree bewitched ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.464

orders presently to be cut down , for fear it should infect the rest .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.465

Thus was the old Man made a Cuckold to his own Face
PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.466

and would not believe it . PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.467

A married Gentleman coming through Canterbury , his Horse threw him ,
which a young Gentlewoman seeing , fell a laughing ;
PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.469

the Man being terribly vext that she should laugh at his fall , angerly
said , Madam , pray admire not at this , PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.470

for my Horse always stumbles when he meets a Whore ;
PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.471

she sharply reply'd , have a care then Sir , you do not meet your Wife ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.472

for then you will certainly break your neck . PENNY-1686-E3-H,161.473

TOM THE TAYLOR . PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.476

1684 . PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.477

A MERRY DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM THE TAYLOR , AND HIS MAID JOAN .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.478

<$$heading>

<font> Tom . <$$font> Hark ye Joan , what a Clock is it ?
PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.480

be you hungry already ? PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.484

it is not yet eleven a Clock , PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.485

and instead of one half-penny Loaf , you have eaten two ;
PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.486

and instead of one pint of Ale , you have had a quart ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.487

and all this you have had to_day already , PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.488

I think the Devil is in your Guts , PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.489

that I do . PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.490

<font> Tom . <$$font> Why how now Huswife , do you snap at me ?
PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.491

do you grudge me my Victuals ? PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.492

Pray Madam Joan , what is it to you how much I eat and drink ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.493

do I not provide it ? PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.494

be it known to you Joan , that your Mistris when she was living , would
not have said so much to me poor Soul . PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.495

<font> Joan . <$$font> No truly Master , no more would not I if I was
your Wife , PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.496

but as I am your Maid , I am not bound to you , PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.497

and therefore I take the greater priviledge , PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.498

but if you@ @'d Marry me , I know what I know . PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.499

<font> Tom . <$$font> Why , what do you know Joan ?
PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.500

PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.502

<font> Tom . <$$font> How kind wouldst thou be ?
PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.503

<font> Ione . <$$font> Ah master , so kind as my mistris us'd to be to

you may remember Sir that in her days I us'e to lye in the Truckle bed ;
PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.505

O then master . PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.506

<font> Tom . <$$font> Why what then Jone . PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.507

<font> Ione . <$$font> Oh dear master , ask me no more questions ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.508

I dare talk no more of those things , PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.509

me@ @thinks I find strange alterations in me already , strange motions ,
strange qualms , PENNY-1686-E3-H,267.510

O how could I <P_268> stretch my self , PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.511

but <paren> alas <$$paren> to what purpose poor Maid that I am ?
PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.512

<font> Tom . <$$font> Well Jone , upon good terms , and upon good
considerations , and upon divers causes moving me thereunto , I say Jone
I could find in my heart to make thee Mistriss of my household , and
Lady of my family , all which you know Ione is honour in abundance ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.513

but first I say you must subscribe and consent to my divers causes and
considerations . PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.514

<font> Ione . <$$font> Pray master , what be those causes &
considerations , PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.515

i@ @'le do any thing rather then lose my longing .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.516

<font> Tom . <$$font> Why then in brief these they are .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.517

First , you shall kiss my hand and swear that you will acknowledge me to
be your Lord and Master . PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.518

<font> Ione . <$$font> I will Sir . PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.519

<font> Tom . <$$font> Secondly , when I come home drunk a nights , you
shall be diligent to make me unready and get me to bed ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.520

and if I chance to befoul my self , you are to make me clean without
chiding me . PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.521

<font> Ione . <$$font> Why must I not keep a maid to do these things
for me ? PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.522

<font> Tom . <$$font> Yes , you must keep a Maid ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.523

but it is not fit she should know of her Masters privicies .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.524

I say you must do these things your self . PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.525

<font> Ione . <$$font> Well if it must be so , it must .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.526

<font> Tom . <$$font> Thirdly , if any Gentle Woman comes to have me
take measure of her , you must forthwith go out of the Room , and leave
us together and not be jealous . PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.527

<font> Ione . <$$font> All this I will observe .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.528

<font> Tom . <$$font> Fourthly you must not let any man kiss you but
your Husband , PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.529

but if any should offer any such thing to you , you must be sure to let
me know what they say or do to you . PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.530

<font> Ione . <$$font> You shall be sure to know all Sir .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.531

<font> Tom . <$$font> Fiftly and lastly , you must Promise not to spend
nor waste your husbands Money nor Goods , and observe alwaies in
Cow-cumber-time , to put less meat in the Pot than at other times ,
because you know that then we have always a Bad Trade :
PENNY-1686-E3-H,268.532

And one thing I had almost forgot , which is , that you shall be sure
<P_269> every day once or twice in the day to muster the Flees and the
Lice that have taken possession in our Bedding and wearing Apparel :
PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.533

I say once again <paren> and be sure you remember this last Article of
our agreement <$$paren> you must destroy , kill , and slay them all , if
possible . PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.534

<font> Ioan . <$$font> If possible <paren> as you say Master <$$paren>
I will , PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.535

but i fear they have inhabited and dwelt with you so long , that now
they will be sturdy and begin to plead custome , PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.536

but however {TEXT:hoever} I@ @'le do my honest endeavour .
PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.537

<font> Tom . <$$font> Well , do you consent to all these things ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.538

and will you be sure hereafter to observe and keep them all ?
PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.539

<font> Ioan . <$$font> I will Sir upon this condition , that you will
grant me two things that I shall ask you . PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.540

<font> Tom . <$$font> Ay , ay , Joan , any thing I say , any thing ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.541

pri@ @thee speak quickly , PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.542

for I begin to be in haste now . PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.543

<font> Ioan . <$$font> Thus it is then , PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.544

First you shall give me leave to chuse what Maid-servant I please ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.545

and secondly , because you shall not be jealous after marriage , I must
let you know that I have a young man that is kin to me ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.546

he is my Cozen ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.547

this young man I say , will often come to see me ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.548

you shall not be jealous of him will ye ? PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.549

<font> Tom . <$$font> No , no , Wench , God forbid that I should be
against thy Relations comming to see thee . PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.550

No , no , I say , he shall be welcome ; PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.551

is this all you have to say Girl , PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.552

pri@ @thee let@ @'s make an end of this Discourse ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.553

for I begin to be a little in haste . PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.554

<font> Ioan . <$$font> And so me@ @thinks am I ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.555

for I care not how soon I am married , and afterward how soon I go to
bed , nor afterward how soon you . PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.556

<font> Tom . <$$font> Well , well honest Jone , I know thy meaning ,

come give me thy hand , PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.558

but now I think on@ @'t , what Church shall we go to Ione ?
PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.560

<font> Jone . <$$font> Why I think that Mr. Cornue had best to marry
us , PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.561

for I am well acquainted with him . PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.562

<font> Tom . <$$font> With all my heart , PENNY-1686-E3-H,269.563

PENNY-1686-E3-H,270.568

well I must make her amends to_night for this great fault ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,270.569

in the mean time i@ @'le go and kiss her a little ,
PENNY-1686-E3-H,270.570

PENNY-1686-E3-H,270.571
