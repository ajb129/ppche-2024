<P_140>

when some wold willingly have goen to Plymmowth , some , as namely M.
Whood , desyred that at least the Frances myght turne in thither and fet
M. Hawkins , MADOX-1582-E2-H,140.389

the generawl wold not in any case suffer yt , which made men thynk that
he wold more gladly have goen withowt hym than to have had his cumpany
that M. Parker myght have been leiftenent . Wherupon great stomack was
taken as the effect did declare , MADOX-1582-E2-H,140.390

but the wynd fawlyng to the west sowthwest cawsed us in despyte to go to
Plymmowth , wher we anchored in the sownd which is a very fayr place .
MADOX-1582-E2-H,140.391

Plymowth stands in the breech of 2 fayr ryvers , MADOX-1582-E2-H,140.392

for yt hath Cat Water on the east syde , and Saltash Water on the west ,
MADOX-1582-E2-H,140.393

and ech of them yeld harboroe for 200 great ships to come furth of the
harboro comodiowsly with any wynd . MADOX-1582-E2-H,140.394

M. Walker and I went thither purposing to have walked only ,
MADOX-1582-E2-H,140.395

but M. leiftenent which was now come from Sir Fraunces Drake at Bucland
had us to M. Whoodes howse wher we supt with M. Whyticars that hath
maried M. Hawkins syster , MADOX-1582-E2-H,140.396

and after we returned to the Edward wher we discoursed with the
viceadmirall of many mens maners and many matters , advising how love
myght best be maynteyned and good order kept , MADOX-1582-E2-H,140.397

but wher overweening pevishnes is once planted , and myxed with a kynd
of creeping dissimulation , yt is hard ther to setle the seeds of any
good advice , MADOX-1582-E2-H,140.398

for now beginneth the hydden poyson to breth owt .
MADOX-1582-E2-H,140.399

Whil M. Hawkins supposed that consydering Sir Frances Drakes bownty to
the whole cumpany and his <P_141> endevowr in this viage , yt had been a
poynt of curtesy to have doen Sir Francis that honowr as to have come to
Plymmowth . M. Fenton on the other syde fownd smal musique on this
string , because he supposed that what water cam to M. Hawkins myl was
lost from his owne , MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.400

and besydes also , I knoe not how , he had as leif go by sir Frances
howse thirsty as cawl and drink . MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.401

Whether he lacked money or noe I can not tel , MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.402

and yet Luk Ward told me he boroed 20@ @=li= of Sir Edward Horsey at the
Cows , and 10@ @=li= of Sir Frances hear , and had withowt any advice of
one or other sent a bil of a_C@ @=li= to London , which I ymagin wil be

for alderman Barnes befor hand did beseech hym to tak head therof . |

2 {COM:Sat.} . MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.405

In the morning the wynd at northwest , the generall wold needs begon ,
althoe Sir Frances send us word that this morning he wold se us .
MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.406

The master desyred that he myght send the pynnyse ashore for the
leiftenent and the pilat and others MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.407

but the general wold not agree , MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.408

yet did the master send yt . MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.409

Yn mean season the generaul comanding to wey anchors , the mariners
utterly refused , saying that they ventured for the thirds and wold not
therfore go withowt the pilats . MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.410

The general hearat storming , the master bad them way
MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.411

and after he wold ply for ther comyng , MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.412

so did they . MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.413

This whyl I was in the Edward . MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.414

Wel away went the gallion and the Edward after MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.415

and the Frances was under sayl , MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.416

but abowt noone Capten Ward and I went to the gallion wher we fownd them
in a great murmuring for that some thowght the Frances upon this
discurtesy wold stay behynd . MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.417

Then dyd we enter in to a close consultation <paren> for every impudent
boy leaned over our sholders <$$paren> whether yt wer better hold on our
cowrse or turn yn agayn . MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.418

When the master had desyred to go back , the generaul blamed hym for
sending back the boat MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.419

and sayd that what if you lead me back againe to reise a mutinie ageinst
mee . MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.420

Thes words the master took yl MADOX-1582-E2-H,141.421

and sayd , yf yt be com to this for my good wil , wold I wer a <P_142>
shore agayn . MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.422

Some aledged the want of a gret meyny of men , MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.423

but the general sayd he wold to Famowth and take us as many as were left
. MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.424

Now al the quarel hearhence did spring that M. Whood and Blaccollar ,
the 2 pilats , sayd they wold not return til they knew how they shold be
used . MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.425

When every man pel_mel had {SIC:and} spent his mowth with as smal
discretion for hym self as attendance for the hearer , Capten Ward at
last sayd that althoe our lat speed hytherto and the fayr wynd presently
dyd wysh hast and althoe yt had been reason thes men shold have attended
us and not wee them , for on thes 2 poynts the general stood , yet
becawse they wer al comended by the cowncel , and because we myght have
more wynd but now cold have noe more men , he wyshed us to stand back ,
MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.426

so did we , MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.427

and when we had stood to the eastward 2 howrs , the Frances was come |
MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.428

but thorow a quarel risen at Plymowth Henry Kyrkman was left behinde
MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.429

for the leftenent had receved abuses by hym . MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.430

The general took yt il and espetially M. Parker MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.431

but some thowght us wel quyt of a pykthank {GLOSS:talebearer} .
MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.432

To cowncel agayn wher we cauld MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.433

and now was every man affrayd of other MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.434

and those that wold have eaten the backsyde of mowntayns wold not now
byte the fore_part of a molehil . MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.435

After muche adoe we were al frends and so knyt up .
MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.436

In this discowrs I noted the generaul colorik and bas , joined with some
craft , M. Haukins open and glorios but very childish , M. Parker fine
and folish and lordly conseeted , Capten Ward a good rownd wis felo , M.
Whood hob_glorios . MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.437

We had a fayr wynd MADOX-1582-E2-H,142.438

Dyvers of our men wer syck MADOX-1582-E2-H,143.445

cumforts and ordynary salves and let them ly in the hands of some honest
merchant and let the surgion be prepared to use the salve when need is
