<P_I,207.C2>

Now I come to your Charge , you of the Jury :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.3

The Greatness of Treason is to be considered in these two things ,
Determinatione finis , and Electione mediorum .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.4

This Treason excelleth in both , for that it was to destroy the King and
his Progeny . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.5

These Treasons are said to be Crimen laesae Majestatis ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.6

this goeth further , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.7

and may be term'd , Crimen extirpandae Regiae Majestatis , & totius
Progeniei suae . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.8

I shall not need , my Lords , to speak any thing concerning the King ,
nor of the Bounty and Sweetness of his Nature , whose Thoughts are
innocent , whose Words are full of Wisdom and Learning , and whose Works
are full of Honour ; although it be a true Saying , Nunquam nimis quod
nunquam satis . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.9

But to whom do you bear Malice ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.10

to the Children ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.11

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> To whom speak you this ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.12

You tell me News I never heard of . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.13

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Oh Sir , do I ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.14

I will prove you the notoriousest Traitor that ever came to the Bar .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.15

After you have taken away the King , you would alter Religion : as you ,
Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> , have followed them of the Bye in
Imitation ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.16

for I will charge you with the Words . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.17

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Your Words can@ @not condemn me ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.18

my Innocency is my Defence . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.19

Prove one of these things wherewith you have charg'd me , and I will
confess the whole Indictment , and that I am the horriblest Traitor that
ever lived , and worthy to be crucified with a_thousand_thousand
Torments . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,207.C2.20

<P_I,208.C1>

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Nay , I will prove all :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.22

Thou art a Monster ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.23

thou hast an <font> English <$$font> Face , but a <font> Spanish
<$$font> Heart . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.24

Now you must have Money : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.25

<font> Aremberg <$$font> was no sooner in <font> England <$$font>
<paren> I charge thee <font> Raleigh <$$font> <$$paren> but thou
incitedst <font> Cobham <$$font> to go unto him , and to deal with him
for Money , to bestow on discontented Persons , to raise Rebellion on
the Kingdom . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.26

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Let me answer for my self .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.27

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Thou shalt not .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.28

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> It concerneth my Life .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.29

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> ,
Mr. Attorney is but yet in the General ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.30

but when the King's Counsel have given the Evidence wholly , you shall
answer every Particular . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.31

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Oh ! do I touch you ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.32

<font> Lord Cecil . <$$font> Mr. Attorney , when you have done with
this General Charge , do you not mean to let him answer every Particular
? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.33

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Yes , when we deliver the Proofs to be read
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.34

<font> Raleigh <$$font> procured <font> Cobham <$$font> to go to <font>
Aremberg <$$font> ; which he did by his Instigation :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.35

<font> Raleigh <$$font> supped with <font> Cobham <$$font> before he
went to <font> Aremberg <$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.36

after Supper , <font> Raleigh <$$font> conducted him to <font>
Durham-House <$$font> ; from whence <font> Cobham <$$font> went with
<font> Lawrency <$$font> , a Servant of <font> Aremberg's <$$font> ,
unto him , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.37

and went in by a Back-way . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.38

<font> Cobham <$$font> could never be quiet until he had entertained
this Motion , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.39

for he had four Letters from <font> Raleigh <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.40

<font> Aremberg <$$font> answer'd , The Money should be performed ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.41

but knew not to whom it should be distributed .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.42

Then <font> Cobham <$$font> and <font> Lawrency <$$font> came back to
<font> Durham-House <$$font> , where they found <font> Raleigh <$$font>
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.43

<font> Cobham <$$font> and <font> Raleigh <$$font> went up ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.44

and left <font> Lawrency <$$font> below , where they had secret
Conference in a Gallery ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.45

and after , <font> Cobham <$$font> and <font> Lawrency <$$font> departed
from <font> Raleigh <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.46

Your Jargon was Peace : What is that ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.47

<font> Spanish <$$font> Invasion , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.48

<font> Scotish <$$font> Subversion . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.49

And again , you are not a fit Man to take so much Money for procuring of
a lawful Peace , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.50

for Peace procured by Money is dishonourable .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.51

Then <font> Cobham <$$font> must go to <font> Spain <$$font> , and
return by <font> Jersey <$$font> , where you were Captain :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.52

And then , because <font> Cobham <$$font> had not so much Policy , or at
least Wickedness , as you , he must have your Advice for the
distribution of the Money . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.53

Would you have deposed so good a King , lineally descended of <font>
Elizabeth <$$font> , eldest Daughter of <font> Edward <$$font> IV ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.54

Why then must you set up another ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.55

I think you meant to make <font> Arabella <$$font> a Titular Queen , of
whose Title I will speak nothing ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.56

but sure you meant to make her a Stale . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.57

Ah ! good Lady , you could mean her no Good .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.58

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> You tell me News , Mr. <font> Attorney
<$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.59

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Oh Sir ! I am the more large , because I
know with whom I deal : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.60

For we have to deal to-day with a Man of Wit .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.61

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Did I ever speak with this Lady ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.62

<font> Attorney . <$$font> I will track you out before I have done .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.63

<font> Englishmen <$$font> will not be led by persuasion of Words ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.64

but they must have Books to persuade . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.65

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> The Book was written by a Man of your
Profession , Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.66

<font> Attorney . <$$font> I would not have you impatient .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.67

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Me@ @thinks you fall out with your self ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.68

I say nothing . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.69

<font> Attorney . <$$font> By this Book you would persuade Men , that
he is not the lawful King . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.70

Now let us consider some Circumstances : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.71

My Lords , you know my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> <paren> for whom we
all lament and rejoice ; lament in that his House , which hath stood so
long unspotted , is now ruinated ; rejoice , in that his Treasons are
reveal'd : <$$paren> RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C1.72

he is neither <P_I,208.C2> Politician nor Sword-man ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.73

<font> Raleigh <$$font> was both , united in the Cause with him , and
therefore Cause of his Destruction . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.74

Another Circumstance is , the secret Contriving of it .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.75

<font> Humphry Stafford <$$font> claimed Sanctuary for Treason .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.76

<font> Raleigh <$$font> , in his <font> Macchivelian <$$font> Policy ,
hath made a Sanctuary for Treason . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.77

He must talk with none but <font> Cobham <$$font> ; because , saith he ,
one Witness can never condemn me . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.78

For <font> Brook <$$font> said unto Sir <font> Griffith Markham , Take
heed how you do make my Lord <$$font> Cobham <font> acquainted <$$font>
; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.79

<font> for whatsoever he knoweth <$$font> , Raleigh <font> the Witch
will get it out of him <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.80

As soon as <font> Raleigh <$$font> was examined on one point of Treason
concerning my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> , he wrote to him thus ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.81

<font> I have been examined of you , and confessed nothing <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.82

Further , you sent to him by your trusty <font> Francis Kemish <$$font>
, that one Witness could not condemn ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.83

and therefore bade his Lordship be of good Courage .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.84

Came this out of <font> Cobham's <$$font> Quiver ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.85

No : but out of <font> Raleigh's Macchivelian <$$font> and devilish
Policy . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.86

Yea , but <font> Cobham <$$font> did retract it ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.87

why then did ye urge it ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.88

Now then see the most horrible Practices that ever came out of the
bottomless Pit of the lowest Hell . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.89

After that <font> Raleigh <$$font> had Intelligence that <font> Cobham
<$$font> had accused him , he endeavour'd to have Intelligence from
<font> Cobham <$$font> , which he had gotten by young Sir <font> John
Payton <$$font> : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.90

But I think it was the Error of his Youth .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.91

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> The Lords told it me ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.92

or else I had not been sent to the <font> Tower <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.93

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Thus <font> Cobham <$$font> , by the
Instigation of <font> Raleigh <$$font> , enter'd into these Actions : So
that the question will be , Whether you are not the principal Traitor ,
and he would nevertheless have enter'd into it ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.94

Why did <font> Cobham <$$font> retract all that same ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.95

First , Because <font> Raleigh <$$font> was so odious , he thought he
should fare the worse for his sake . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.96

Secondly , He thought thus with himself , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.97

If he be free , I shall clear my self the better .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.98

After this , <font> Cobham <$$font> asked for a Preacher to confer with
, pretending to have Dr. <font> Andrews <$$font> ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.99

but indeed he meant not to have him , but Mr. <font> Galloway <$$font>
; a worthy and reverend Preacher , who can do more with the King <paren>
as he said <$$paren> than any other ; that he , seeing his constant
Denial , might inform the King thereof . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.100

Here he plays with the Preacher . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.101

If <font> Raleigh <$$font> could persuade the Lords , that <font> Cobham
<$$font> had no intent to travel , then he thought all should be well .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.102

Here is Forgery ! RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.103

In the <font> Tower <$$font> <font> Cobham <$$font> must write to Sir
<font> Thomas Vane <$$font> , a worthy Man , that he meant not to go
into <font> Spain : <$$font> which Letter <font> Raleigh <$$font>
devised in <font> Cobham's <$$font> Name .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.104

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I will wash my hands of the Indictment , and
die a true Man to the King . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.105

<font> Attorney . <$$font> You are the absolutest Traitor that ever was
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.106

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Your Phrases will not prove it , Mr. <font>
Attorney <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.107

<font> Attorney . <$$font> <font> Cobham <$$font> writeth a Letter to
my Lord <font> Cecil <$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.108

and doth will <font> Mellis's <$$font> Man to lay it in a <font> Spanish
<$$font> Bible , and to make as tho he found it by chance .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.109

This was after he had Intelligence with this Viper , that he was false .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.110

<font> Lord Cecil . <$$font> You mean a Letter intended to me ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.111

I never had it . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.112

<font> Attorney . <$$font> No , my Lord , you had it not .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.113

You , my Masters of the Jury , respect not the Wickedness and Hatred of
the Man , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.114

respect his Cause : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.115

if he be guilty , I know you will have care of it , for the Preservation
of the King , the Continuance of the Gospel authorized , and the Good of
us all . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,208.C2.116

<P_I,209.C1>

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I do not hear yet , that you have spoken one
word against me ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.118

here is no Treason of mine done : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.119

If my Lord <font> Cabham <$$font> be a Traitor , what is that to me ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.120

<font> Attorney . <$$font> All that he did was by thy Instigation ,
thou Viper ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.121

for I <font> thou <$$font> thee , thou Traitor .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.122

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> It becometh not a Man of Quality and Virtue ,
to call me so : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.123

But I take comfort in it , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.124

it is all you can do . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.125

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Have I anger'd you ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.126

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I am in no case to be angry .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.127

<font> C. J. Popham . <$$font> Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> ,
Mr. Attorney speaketh out of the Zeal of his Duty , for the Service of
the King , and you for your Life ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.128

be valiant on both sides . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.129

Now they proceed to the Reading the Proofs .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.130

<heading>

THE LORD COBHAM@ @'S EXAMINATION READ . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.132

<$$heading>

He confesseth , he had a Pass-port to go into <font> Spain <$$font> ,
intending to go to the Archduke , to confer with him about these
Practices ; and because he knew the Archduke had not Money to pay his
own Army , from thence he meant to go to <font> Spain <$$font> , to deal
with the King for the 600000 Crowns , and to return by <font> Jersey
<$$font> ; and that nothing should be done , until he had spoken with
Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> for distribution of the Money to them
which were discontented in <font> England <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.134

At the first beginning , he breathed out Oaths and Exclamations against
<font> Raleigh <$$font> , calling him Villain and Traitor ; saying , he
had never entred into these Courses , but by his Instigation , and that
he would never let him alone . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.135

Here Mr. Attorney willed the Clerk of the Crown-Office to read over
these last Words again <paren> <font> He would never let him alone .
<$$font> <$$paren> RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.136

<heading>

THE LORD COBHAM@ @'S EXAMINATION . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.138

<$$heading>

Besides he spake of Plots and Invasions ; of the Particulars whereof he
could give no Account , tho <font> Raleigh <$$font> and he had conferred
of them . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.140

Further he said , He was afraid of <font> Raleigh <$$font> , that when
he should return by <font> Jersey <$$font> , that he would have
deliver'd him and the Money to the King .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.141

Being examined of Sir <font> Arthur Gorge <$$font> , he freed him ,
saying , They never durst trust him ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.142

but Sir <font> Arthur Savage <$$font> they intended to use , because
they thought him a fit Man . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.143

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Let me see the Accusation :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.144

This is absolutely all the Evidence can be brought against me ; poor
Shifts ! RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.145

You Gentlemen of the Jury , I pray you understand this .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.146

This is that which must either condemn , or give me Life ; which must
free me , or send my Wife and Children to beg their Bread about the
Streets : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.147

This is that must prove me a notorious Traitor , or a true Subject to
the King . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.148

Let me see my Accusation , that I may make my Answer .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.149

<font> Clerk of the Council . <$$font> I did read it , and shew you all
the Examinations . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.150

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> At my first Examination at <font> Windsor
<$$font> , my Lords asked me , what I knew of <font> Cobham's <$$font>
Practice with <font> Aremberg <$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.151

I answer'd negatively : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.152

And as concerning <font> Arabella <$$font> , I protest before God , I
never heard one word of it . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.153

If that be proved , let me be quilty of ten_thousand Treasons .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.154

It is a strange thing you will impute that to me , when I never heard so
much as the Name of <font> Arabella Stuart <$$font> , but only the Name
of <font> Arabella <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C1.155

<P_I,209.C2>

After being examin'd , I told my Lords , that I thought my Lord <font>
Cobham <$$font> had Conference with <font> Aremberg <$$font> ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.157

I suspected his visiting of him : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.158

for after he departed from me at <font> Durham-House <$$font> , I saw
him pass by his own Stairs , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.159

and passed over to <font> St. Mary Saviours <$$font> , where I knew
<font> Lawrency <$$font> , a Merchant , and a Follower of <font>
Aremberg <$$font> , lay , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.160

and therefore likely to go unto him . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.161

My Lord <font> Cecil <$$font> asked my Opinion concerning <font>
Lawrency <$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.162

I said , that if you do not apprehend <font> Lawrency <$$font> , it is
dangerous , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.163

he will fly : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.164

if you do apprehend him , you shall give my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font>
notice thereof . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.165

I was asked who was the greatest Man with my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font>
; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.166

I answer'd , I knew no Man so great with him , as young <font> Wyat
<$$font> of <font> Kent <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.167

As soon as <font> Cobham <$$font> saw my Letter to have discover'd his
Dealing with <font> Aremberg <$$font> , in his Fury he accus'd me ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.168

but before he came to the Stair-foot he repented ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.169

and said he had done me wrong . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.170

When he came to the end of his Accusation , he added , that if he had
brought this Money to <font> Jersey <$$font> , he fear'd that I would
have deliver'd him and the Money to the King .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.171

Mr. Attorney , you said this never came out of <font> Cobham's <$$font>
Quiver ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.172

he is a simple Man . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.173

Is he so simple ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.174

no ; he hath a Disposition of his own , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.175

he will not easily be guided by others ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.176

but when he has once taken head in a Matter , he is not easily drawn
from it : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.177

he is no Babe . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.178

But it is strange for me to devise with <font> Cobham <$$font> , that he
should go to <font> Spain <$$font> , to persuade the King to disburse so
much Money , he being a Man of no Love in <font> England <$$font> , and
I having resigned my room of chiefest Command , the Wardenship of the
<font> Stannaries <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.179

Is it not strange for me to make my self <font> Robin Hood <$$font> , or
a <font> Kett <$$font> , or a <font> Cade ? <$$font>
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.180

I knowing <font> England <$$font> to be in better Estate to defend it
self than ever it was . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.181

I knew <font> Scotland <$$font> united ; <font> Ireland <$$font> quieted
, wherein of late our Forces were dispersed ; <font> Denmark <$$font>
assured , which before was suspected . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.182

I knew , that having lost a Lady whom Time had surpriz'd , we had now an
active King , a lawful Successor , who would himself be present in all
his Affairs . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.183

The State of <font> Spain <$$font> was not unknown to me :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.184

I had written a Discourse , which I had intended to present unto the
King , against Peace with <font> Spain <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.185

I knew the <font> Spaniards <$$font> had six Repulses ; three in <font>
Ireland <$$font> , and three at Sea , and once in 1588 , at <font> Cales
<$$font> , by my Lord Admiral . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.186

I knew he was discourag'd and dishonour'd .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.187

I knew the King of <font> Spain <$$font> to be the proudest Prince in
Christendom ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.188

but now he cometh creeping to the King my Master for Peace .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.189

I knew , whereas before he had in his Port six or seven_score Sail of
Ships , he hath now but six or seven . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.190

I knew of twenty_five Millions he had from his <font> Indies <$$font> ,
he hath scarce one left . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.191

I knew him to be so poor , that the Jesuits in <font> Spain <$$font> ,
who were wont to have such large Allowance , were fain to beg at the
Church-Door . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.192

Was it ever read or heard , that any Prince should disburse so much
Money without a sufficient Pawn ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.193

I knew her own Subjects , the Citizens of <font> London <$$font> , would
not lend her Majesty Money , without Lands in Mortgage .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.194

I knew the Queen did not lend the States Money , without <font> Flushing
<$$font> , <font> Brill <$$font> , and other Towns for a Pawn .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.195

And can it be thought , that he would let <font> Cobham <$$font> have so
great a Sum ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.196

I never came to the Lord <font> Cobham@ @'s <$$font> , but about Matters
of his Profit ; as , the ordering of his House , paying of his Servants
Board-Wages , <font> &c. <$$font> RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,209.C2.197

I had of his , when I was examin'd , four_thousand Pounds worth of
Jewels for a Purchase ; a Pearl of <P_I,210.C1> three_thousand Pound ;
and a Ring worth five_hundred Pound . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.198

If he had had a fancy to run away , he would not have left so much to
have purchas'd a Lease in Fee-Farm . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.199

I saw him buy three_hundred Pounds worth of Books to send to his Library
at <font> Canterbury <$$font> , and a Cabinet of thirty Pound , to give
to Mr. Attorney , for drawing the Conveyances :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.200

and God in Heaven knoweth , not I , whether he intended to travel or no
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.201

But for that Practice with <font> Arabella <$$font> , or Letters to
<font> Aremberg <$$font> framed , or any Discourse with him , or in what
Language he spake unto him ; if I knew any of these things , I would
absolutely confess the Indictment , and acknowledge my self worthy
ten_thousand Deaths . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.202

COBHAM'S SECOND EXAMINATION READ . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.204

<$$heading>

The Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> being requir'd to subscribe to an
Examination , there was shewed a Note under Sir <font> Walter Raleigh's
<$$font> hand ; the which when he had perus'd , he paus'd , and after
brake forth into these Speeches : Oh Villain ! Oh Traitor !
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.206

I will now tell you all the Truth ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.207

and then said , His Purpose was to go into <font> Flanders <$$font> ,
and into <font> Spain <$$font> , for the obtaining the aforesaid Money ;
and that <font> Raleigh <$$font> had appointed to meet him in <font>
Jersey <$$font> as he return'd home , to be advised of him about the
Distribution of the Money . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.208

<font> L. C. J. Popham . <$$font> When <font> Cobham <$$font>
answer'd to the Interrogatories , he made scruple to subscribe ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.209

and being urg'd to it , he said , if he might hear me affirm , that a
Person of his Degree ought to set his hand , he would :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.210

I lying then at <font> Richmond <$$font> for fear of the Plague , was
sent for , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.211

and I told he ought to subscribe ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.212

otherwise it were a Contempt of a high nature :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.213

then he subscribed . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.214

The Lords question'd with him further , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.215

and he shew'd them a Letter , as I thought written to me ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.216

but it was indeed written to my Lord <font> Cecil : <$$font>
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.217

he desired to see the Letter again , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.218

and then said , Oh Wretch ! Oh Traitor ! whereby I perceiv'd you had
not perform'd that Trust he had reposed in you .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.219

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> He is as passionate a Man as lives ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.220

for he hath not spared the best Friends he hath in <font> England
<$$font> in his Passion . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.221

My Lords , I take it , he that has been examined , has ever been asked
at the time of his Examination , if it be according to his meaning , and
then to subscribe . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.222

Me@ @thinks , my Lords , when he accuses a Man , he should give some
Account and Reason of it : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.223

It is not sufficient to say , we talked of it .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.224

If I had been the Plotter , would not I have given <font> Cobham
<$$font> some Arguments , whereby to persuade the King of <font> Spain
<$$font> , and answer his Objections ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.225

I knew <font> Westmoreland <$$font> and <font> Bothwell <$$font> , Men
of other Understandings than <font> Cobham <$$font> , were ready to beg
their Bread . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.226

<font> Sir <$$font> Tho. Fowler , <font> one of the Jury . <$$font>
Did Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> write a Letter to my Lord before
he was examined concerning him , or not ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.227

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Yes . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.228

<font> Lord Cecil . <$$font> I am in great dispute with my self to
speak in the Case of this Gentleman : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.229

A former Dearness between me and him , ty'd so firm a Knot of my Conceit
of his Virtues , now broken by a Discovery of his Imperfections .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.230

I protest , did I serve a King that I knew would be displeased with me
for speaking , in this Case I would speak , whatever came of it ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.231

but seeing he is compacted of Piety and Justice , and one that will not
mislike of any Man for speaking a Truth , I will answer your Question .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C1.232

Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> was staid by me at <font> Windsor
<$$font> , upon the first News of <font> Copley <$$font> , that the
King's Person <P_I,210.C2> should be surprized by my Lord <font> Grey
<$$font> , and Mr. <font> George Brook <$$font> ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.233

when I found <font> Brook <$$font> was in , I suspected <font> Cobham
<$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.234

then I doubted <font> Raleigh <$$font> to be a Partaker .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.235

I speak not this , that it should be thought I had greater Judgment than
the rest of my Lords , in making this haste to have them examined .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.236

<font> Raleigh <$$font> following to <font> Windsor <$$font> , I met
with him upon the Terras , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.237

and willed him , as from the King , to stay ; saying , the Lords had
something to say to him : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.238

then he was examined , but not concerning my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font>
, but of the surprizing Treason . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.239

My Lord <font> Grey <$$font> was apprehended , and likewise <font> Brook
<$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.240

by <font> Brook <$$font> we found , that he had given notice to <font>
Cobham <$$font> of the surprizing Treason , as he deliver'd it to us ;
but with as much sparingness of a Brother , as he might .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.241

We sent for my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> to <font> Richmond <$$font> ,
where he stood upon his Justification , and his Quality ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.242

sometimes being froward , he said he was not bound to subscribe ,
wherewith we made the King acquainted . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.243

<font> Cobham <$$font> said , if my Lord Chief Justice would say it were
a Contempt , he would subscribe ; whereof being resolv'd , he subscrib'd
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.244

There was a Light given to <font> Aremberg <$$font> , that <font>
Lawrency <$$font> was examined ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.245

but that <font> Raleigh <$$font> knew that <font> Cobham <$$font> was
examined , is more than I know . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.246

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> If my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> had trusted
me in the Main , was not I as fit a Man to be trusted in the Bye ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.247

<font> Lord Cecil . <$$font> <font> Raleigh <$$font> did by his Letters
acquaint us , that my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> had sent <font>
Lawrency <$$font> to <font> Aremberg <$$font> , when he knew not he had
any Dealings with him . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.248

<font> Lord Hen. Howard . <$$font> It made for you , if <font>
Lawrency <$$font> had been only acquainted with <font> Cobham <$$font> ,
and not with you . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.249

But you knew his whole Estate , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.250

and were acquainted with <font> Cobham's <$$font> Practice with <font>
Lawrency <$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.251

and it was known to you before , that <font> Lawrency <$$font> depended
on <font> Aremberg <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.252

<font> Attorney . <$$font> 1 . <font> Raleigh <$$font> protested
against the surprizing Treason . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.253

2 . That he knew not of the Matter touching <font> Arabella <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.254

I would not charge you , Sir <font> Walter <$$font> , with a Matter of
Falshood : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.255

You say you suspected the Intelligence that <font> Cobham <$$font> had
with <font> Aremberg <$$font> by <font> Lawrency <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.256

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I thought it had been no other Intelligence ,
but such as might be warranted . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.257

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Then it was but lawful Suspicion .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.258

But to that whereas you said , that <font> Cobham <$$font> had accused
you in Passion , I answer three ways : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.259

1 . I observed when <font> Cobham <$$font> said , Let me see the Letter
again , he paus'd ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.260

and when he did see that Count <font> Aremberg <$$font> was touch'd , he
cry'd out , Oh Traitor ! Oh Villain ! now will I confess the whole
Truth . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.261

2 . The Accusation of a Man on hearsay , is nothing :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.262

Would he accuse himself on Passion , and ruinate his Cause and Posterity
, out of malice to accuse you ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.263

3 . Could this be out of Passion ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.264

Mark the Manner of it ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.265

<font> Cobham <$$font> had told this at least two Months before to his
Brother <font> Brook , You are Fools , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.266

you are on the Bye <$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.267

Raleigh <font> and I are on the Main ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.268

we mean to take away the King and his Cubs : <$$font>
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.269

this he deliver'd two Months before . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.270

So mark the Manner and the Matter ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.271

he would not turn the Weapon against his own Bosom , and accuse himself
to accuse you . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.272

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Hath <font> Cobham <$$font> confessed that ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.273

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> This is spoken by Mr. Attorney , to
prove that <font> Cobham's <$$font> Speech came not out of Passion .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.274

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Let it be proved that <font> Cobham <$$font>
said so . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,210.C2.275

<P_I,212.C2>

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> The Attorney hath made a long Narration of
<font> Copley <$$font> , and the Priests , which concerns me nothing ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.277

neither know I how <font> Cobham <$$font> was alter'd .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.278

For he told me , if I would agree to further the Peace , he would get me
8000 Crowns . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.279

I asked him , Who shall have the rest of the Money ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.280

He said , I will offer such a Nobleman who was not named some of the
Money . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.281

I said , he will not be persuaded by you ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.282

and he will extremely hate you for such a Motion .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.283

Let me be pinched to death with hot Irons , if ever I knew there was any
Intention to bestow the Money on discontented Persons .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.284

I had made a Discourse against the Peace ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.285

and would have printed it : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.286

If <font> Cobham <$$font> changed his mind , if the Priests , if <font>
Brook <$$font> had any such Intent , what is that to me ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.287

They must answer for it . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.288

He offered me the Mony before <font> Aremberg <$$font> came ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.289

that is difference of time . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.290

<font> Serj. Philips . <$$font> <font> Raleigh <$$font> confesseth the
matter , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.291

but avoideth it by distinguishing of Times .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.292

You said it was offer'd you before the coming of <font> Aremberg
<$$font> , which is false . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.293

For you being examined whether you should have such Money of <font>
Cobham <$$font> , or not ; you said , yea , and that you should have it
within two or three days . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.294

Nemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.295

<font> Ld. Henry Howard . <$$font> Alledge me any Ground or Cause ,
wherefore you gave ear to my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> for receiving
Pensions , in Matters you had not to deal with .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.296

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Could I stop my Lord <font> Cobham@ @'s
<$$font> Mouth ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.297

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>
presseth , that my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> should be brought Face to
Face . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.298

If he ask things of Favour and Grace , they must come only from him that
can give them . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.299

If we sit here as Commissioners , how shall we be satisfied whether he
ought to be brought , unless we hear the Judges speak ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.300

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> This thing can@ @not be granted ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.301

for then a number of Treasons should flourish :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.302

The Accuser may be drawn by Practice , whilst he is in Person .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.303

<font> Judge Gawdy . <$$font> The Statute you speak of , concerning two
Witnesses in Case of Treason , is found to be inconvenient ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.304

therefore by another Law it was taken away .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.305

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> The common Trial of <font> England <$$font>
is by Jury and Witnesses . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.306

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> No , by Examination :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.307

If three conspire a Treason , and they all confess it ; here is never a
Witness , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.308

yet they are condemned . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.309

<font> Judge Warburton . <$$font> I marvel , Sir <font> Walter <$$font>
, that you being of such Experience and Wit , should stand on this Point
; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.310

for so many Horse-stealers may escape , if they may not be condemned
without Witnesses . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.311

If one should rush into the King's Privy-Chamber , whilst he is alone ,
and kill the King <paren> which God forbid <$$paren> and this Man be met
coming with his Sword drawn all bloody ; shall not he be condemned to
death ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.312

My Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> hath , perhaps , been laboured withal ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.313

and to save you , his old Friend , it may be that he will deny all that
which he hath said . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.314

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I know not how you conceive the Law .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.315

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> Nay , we do not conceive the Law ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.316

but we know the Law . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.317

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> The Wisdom of the Law of God is absolute and
perfect , Haec fac , & vives , &c. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.318

But now by the Wisdom of the State , the Wisdom of the Law is uncertain
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.319

Indeed where the Accuser is not to be had conveniently , I agree with
you ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,212.C2.320

<P_I,213.C1>

but here my Accuser may , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.322

he is alive , and in the House . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.323

<font> Susanna <$$font> had been condemned , if <font> Daniel <$$font>
had not cried out , <font> Will you condemn an innocent <$$font>
Israelite , <font> without Examination or Knowledge of the Truth ?
<$$font> RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.324

Remember , it is absolutely the Commandment of God :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.325

If a false Witness rise up , you shall cause him to be brought before
the Judges ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.326

if he be found false , he shall have the Punishment which the Accused
should have had . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.327

It is very sure for my Lord to accuse me is my certain Danger ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.328

and it may be a means to excuse himself .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.329

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> There must not such a Gap be opened for
the Destruction of the King , as would be if we should grant this .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.330

You plead hard for your self , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.331

but the Laws plead as hard for the King .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.332

I did never hear that Course to be taken in a Case of Treason , as to
write one to another , or speak one to another during the time of their
Imprisonment . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.333

There hath been Intelligence between you :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.334

and what underhand Practices there may be , I know not .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.335

If the Circumstances agree not with the Evidence , we will not condemn
you . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.336

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> The King desires nothing but the knowledge of
the Truth , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.337

and would have no advantage taken by Severity of the Law .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.338

If ever we had a gracious King , now we have ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.339

I hope , as he is , such are his Ministers .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.340

If there be but a Trial of five Marks at common Law , a Witness must be
deposed . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.341

Good my Lords , let my Accuser come Face to Face , and be deposed .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.342

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> You have no Law for it :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.343

God forbid any Man should accuse himself upon his Oath .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.344

<font> Attorn. <$$font> The Law presumes , a Man will not accuse
himself to accuse another . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.345

You are an odious Man : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.346

For <font> Cobham <$$font> thinks his Cause the worse that you are in it
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.347

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I protest before God , I meant it not by any
Privy-Counsellor ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.356

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I think so still :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.362

I have spoken it to divers of the Lords of the Council , by way of

if they , like unnatural Villains , should use those words , shall I be
charged with them ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.366

I will not hear it , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.367

I was never any Plotter with them against my Country ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.368

I was never false to the Crown of <font> England <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C1.369

RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.391

There is a Law of two sorts of Accusers , one of his own Knowledge ,
another by Hear-say . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.392

Would he tell his Brother any thing of Malice against <font> Raleigh

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> <font> Brook <$$font> never loved me ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.398

until his Brother had accused me , he said nothing .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.399

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> We have heard nothing that might lead us
to think that <font> Brook <$$font> accused you ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.400

he was only in the surprizing Treason ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.401

for by accusing you he should accuse his Brother .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.402

<font> Brook : <$$font> RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.410

and <font> Raleigh <$$font> said it was foolishly written . '
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.411

<font> Attorn. <$$font> After the King came within twelve Miles of
<font> London <$$font> , <font> Cobham <$$font> never came to see him ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.412

and intended to travel without seeing the Queen and the Prince .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.413

Now in this Discontentment you gave him the Book ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.414

and he gave it his Brother . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.415

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I never gave it him ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.416

he took it off my Table . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.417

For I well remember a little before that time I received a Challenge
from Sir <font> Amias Preston <$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.418

and for that I did intend to answer it , I resolved to leave my Estate
settled , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.419

therefore laid out all my loose Papers , amongst which was this Book .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.420

<font> Ld. Howard . <$$font> Where had you this Book ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.421

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> In the old Lord Treasurer's Study , after his
Death . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,213.C2.422

<P_I,214.C1>

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> Did you ever shew or make known the Book
to me ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.424

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> No , my Lord .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.425

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> Was it one of the Books which was left to
me or my Brother ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.426

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I took it out of the Study in my Lord
Treasurer's House in the <font> Strand <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.427

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> After my Father's decease , Sir <font>
Walter Raleigh <$$font> desired to search for some Cosmographical
Descriptions of the <font> Indies <$$font> , which he thought were in
his Study , and were not to be had in Print ; which I granted ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.428

and would have trusted Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> as soon as any
Man : tho since for some Infirmities , the Bands of my Affection to him
have been broken ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.429

and yet reserving my Duty to the King my Master , which I can by no
means dispense with , by God I love him , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.430

and have a great Conflict within my self :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.431

But I must needs say , Sir <font> Walter <$$font> used me a little
unkindly , to take the Book away without my Knowledge ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.432

nevertheless , I need make no Apology in behalf of my Father ,
considering how useful and necessary it is for Privy Counsellors , and
those in his Place , to intercept and keep such kind of Writings ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.433

for whosoever should then search his Study , may in all likelihood find
all the notorious Libels that were writ against the late Queen ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.434

and whosoever should rumage my Study , at least my Cabinet , may find
several against the King , our Sovereign Lord , since his Accession to
the Throne . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.435

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> The Book was in Manuscript ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.436

and the late Lord Treasurer had wrote in the beginning of it with his
own Hand , these Words , <font> This is the Book of <$$font> Robert
Snagg . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.437

And I do own , as my Lord <font> Cecil <$$font> has said , that I
believe they may also find in my House , almost all the Libels that have
been writ against the late Queen . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.438

<font> Attorn. <$$font> You were no Privy-Councellor ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.439

and I hope never shall be . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.440

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> He was not a sworn Counsellor of State ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.441

but he has been called to Consultations .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.442

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I think it a very severe Interpretation of
the Law , to bring me within Compass of Treason for this Book , writ so
long ago , of which no body had read any more than the Heads of the
Chapters , and which was burnt by <font> G. Brook <$$font> without my
Privity ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.443

admitting I had delivered the same to the Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> ,
without allowing or approving , but discommending it , according to
<font> Cobham's <$$font> first Accusation : and put the Case , I should
come to my Lord <font> Cecil <$$font> , as I have often done , and find
a Stranger with him , with a Packet of Libels , and my Lord should let
me have one or two of them to peruse : This I hope is no Treason .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.444

<font> Attorn. <$$font> I observe there was Intelligence between you
and <font> Cobham <$$font> in the <font> Tower <$$font> ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.445

for after he said , it was against the King's Title , he denied it again
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.446

<font> Sir Will. Wade . <$$font> First my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font>
confesseth it , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.447

and after he had subscribed it , he revoked it again :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.448

To me he always said , that the Drift of it was against the King's Title
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.449

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I protest before God , and all his Works , I
gave him not the Book . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.450

<font> Note <$$font> , Sir <font> Robert Wroth <$$font> speaketh , or
whispereth something secretly . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.451

<font> Attorn. <$$font> My Lords , I must complain of Sir <font> Robert
Wroth <$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.452

he says this Evidence is not material . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.453

<font> Sir Rob. Wroth . <$$font> I never spake the words .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C1.454

<font> Sir Rob. Wroth . <$$font> I will speak as truly as you , Mr.

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I burned it not .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.461

<font> Serj. Philips . <$$font> You presented your Friend with it ,

If it had been before the Queen's Death , it had been a less matter ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.463

but you gave it him presently when he came from the King , which was the
time of this Discontentment . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.464

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Here is a Book supposed to be treasonable ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.465

I never read it , commended it , or deliver'd it , nor urged it .

<font> Attorn. <$$font> Why this is cunning .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.467

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Every thing that doth make for me is cunning
, RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.468

and every thing that maketh against me is probable .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.469

<font> Attorn. <$$font> Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> saith , that <font>
Kemish <$$font> came to him with a Letter torn , and did wish him not to
be dismay'd , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.470

for one Witness could not hurt him . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.471

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> This poor Man hath been close Prisoner these
eighteen Weeks ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.472

he was offered the Rack to make him confess .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.473

I never sent any such Message by him , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.474

I only writ to him , to tell him what I had done with Mr. Attorney ;
having of his at that time a great Pearl and a Diamond .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.475

<font> Ld. H. Howard . <$$font> No Circumstance moveth me more than
this . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.476

<font> Kemish <$$font> was never on the Rack ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.477

the King gave charge that no Rigour should be used .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.478

<font> Commissioners . <$$font> We protest before God , there was no
such matter intended to our Knowledges . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.479

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Was not the Keeper of the Rack sent for , and
he threatned with it ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.480

<font> Sir W. Wade . <$$font> When Mr. Sollicitor and my self
examined <font> Kemish <$$font> , we told him he deserved the Rack ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.481

but did not threaten him with it . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.482

<font> Commissioners . <$$font> It was more than we knew .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.483

<heading>

COBHAM'S EXAMINATION READ . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.485

<$$heading>

He saith , <font> Kemish <$$font> brought him a Letter from <font>
Raleigh <$$font> , and that part which was concerning the Lords of the
Council was rent out ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.487

the Letter contained that he was examined , and cleared himself of all ;
and that the Lord <font> H. Howard <$$font> said , because he was
discontent , he was fit to be in the Action . And further , that <font>
Kemish <$$font> said to him from <font> Raleigh <$$font> , that he
should be of good Comfort , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.488

for one Witness could not condemn a Man for Treason .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.489

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> <font> Cobham <$$font> was ask'd , whether
, and when he heard from you ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.490

he said ; every day . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.491

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> <font> Kemish <$$font> added more ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.492

I never bade him speak those Words . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.493

<font> Note <$$font> , Mr. Attorney here offered to interrupt him .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.494

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> It is his last Discourse ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.495

give him leave , Mr. Attorney . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.496

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I am accused concerning <font> Arabella
<$$font> , concerning Money out of <font> Spain <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.497

My Lord Chief Justice saith , a Man may be condemned with one Witness ,
yea , without any Witness . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.498

<font> Cobham <$$font> is guilty of many things ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.499

Conscientia mille Testes ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.500

he hath accused himself , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.501

what can he hope for but Mercy ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.502

My Lords , vouchsafe me this Grace : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.503

Let him be brought , being alive , and in the House ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.504

let him avouch any of these things , I will confess the whole Indictment
, and renounce the King's Mercy . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.505

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> Here hath been a touch of the Lady <font>
Arabella Stuart <$$font> , a near Kinswoman of the King's .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,214.C2.506

<P_I,215.C1>

Let us not scandal the innocent by Confusion of Speech :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.508

She is as innocent of all these things as I , or any Man here ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.509

only she received a Letter from my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> , to
prepare her ; which she laugh'd at , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.510

and immediately sent it to the King . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.511

So far was she from Discontentment , that she laugh'd him to scorn .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.512

But you see how far the Count of <font> Aremberg <$$font> did consent .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.513

The Lord Admiral <paren> <font> Nottingham <$$font> <$$paren> being by
in a Standing , with the Lady <font> Arabella <$$font> , spake to the
Court . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.514

The Lady doth here protest upon her Salvation , that she never dealt in
any of these things ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.515

and so she willed me to tell the Court . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.516

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> The Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> wrote to
my Lady <font> Arabella <$$font> , to know if he might come to speak
with her , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.517

and gave her to understand , that there were some about the King that
laboured to disgrace her ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.518

she doubted it was but a Trick . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.519

But <font> Brook <$$font> saith , his Brother moved him to procure
<font> Arabella <$$font> to write Letters to the King of <font> Spain
<$$font> ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.520

but he saith , he never did it . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.521

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> The Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> hath accused
me , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.522

you see in what manner he hath forsworn it .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.523

Were it not for his Accusation , all this were nothing .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.524

Let him be asked , if I knew of the Letter which <font> Lawrency
<$$font> brought to him from <font> Aremberg <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.525

Let me speak for my Life , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.526

it can be no hurt for him to be brought ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.527

he dares not accuse me . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.528

If you grant me not this Favour , I am strangely used .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.529

<font> Campian <$$font> was not denied to have his Accusers face to face
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.530

<font> Ld. Ch. Just. <$$font> Since he must needs have Justice , the
acquitting of his old Friend may move him to speak otherwise than the
Truth . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.531

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> If I had been the Infuser of all these
Treasons into him ; you Gentlemen of the Jury , mark this ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.532

he said I have been the Cause of all his Miseries , and the Destruction
of his House , and that all Evil hath happened unto him by my wicked
Counsel : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.533

If this be true , whom hath he cause to accuse , and to be revenged on ,
but on me ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.534

And I know him to be as revengeful as any Man on Earth .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.535

<font> Attorn. <$$font> He is a Party , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.536

and may not come ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.537

the Law is against it . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.538

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> It is a Toy to tell me of Law ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.539

I defy such Law , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.540

I stand on the Fact . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.541

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> I am afraid my often speaking <paren> who
am inferiour to my Lords here present <$$paren> will make the World
think I delight to hear my self talk . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.542

My Affection to you , Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> , was not
extinguished , but slaked , in regard of your Deserts .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.543

You know the Law of the Realm <paren> to which your Mind doth not
contest <$$paren> that my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> can@ @not be
brought . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.544

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> He may be , my Lord .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.545

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> But dare you challenge it ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.546

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> No . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.547

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> You say that my Lord <font> Cobham
<$$font> , your main Accuser , must come to accuse you .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.548

You say , he hath retracted : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.549

I say , many Particulars are not retracted .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.550

What the Validity of all this is , is merely left to the Jury .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.551

Let me ask you this , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.552

If my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> will say you were the only Instigator
of him to proceed in the Treasons , dare you put your self on this ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C1.553

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> If he will speak it before God and the King ,
that ever I knew of <font> Arabella's <$$font> Matter , or the Money out
of <font> Spain <$$font> , or the surprising Treason ; <P_I,215.C2> I
put my self on it , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.554

God's Will and the King's be done with me .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.555

<font> Ld. H. Howard . <$$font> How ! if he speak things equivalent
to that you have said ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.556

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Yes , in a main Point .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.557

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> If he say , you have been the Instigator
of him to deal with the <font> Spanish <$$font> King , had not the
Council cause to draw you hither ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.558

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I put my self on it .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.559

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> Then Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> ,
call upon God , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.560

and prepare your self ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.561

for I do verily believe my Lords will prove this .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.562

Excepting your faults <paren> I call them no worse <$$paren> by God I am
your Friend . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.563

The Heat and Passion in you , and the Attorney's Zeal in the King's
Service , makes me speak this . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.564

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Whosoever is the Workman , it is reason he
should give an account of his Work to the Workmaster .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.565

But let it be proved that he acquainted me with any of his Conferences
with <font> Aremberg : <$$font> RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.566

he would surely have given me some account .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.567

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> That follows not :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.568

If I set you on work , and you give me no account , am I therefore
innocent ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.569

<font> Attorn. <$$font> For the Lady <font> Arabella <$$font> , I said
she was never acquainted with the matter .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.570

Now that <font> Raleigh <$$font> had Conference in all these Treasons ,
it is manifest : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.571

The Jury hath heard the matter . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.572

There is one <font> Dyer <$$font> , a Pilot , that being in <font>
Lisbon <$$font> , met with a <font> Portugal <$$font> Gentleman , who
ask'd him if the King of <font> England <$$font> was crown'd yet ? To
whom he answered , <font> I think not yet ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.573

but he shall be shortly <$$font> . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.574

Nay , saith the <font> Portugal <$$font> ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.575

that shall never be , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.576

for his Throat will be cut by <font> Don Raleigh <$$font> and <font> Don
Cobham <$$font> before he be crowned . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.577

Dyer <font> was called and sworn , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.578

and deliver'd this Evidence . <$$font> RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.579

<font> Dyer . <$$font> I came to a Merchant's House in <font> Lisbon
<$$font> , to see a Boy that I had there ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.580

there came a Gentleman into the House , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.581

and enquiring what Countryman I was , I said , an <font> Englishman
<$$font> . Whereupon he asked me , if the King was crowned ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.582

And I answered , No , but that I hoped he should be so shortly .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.583

Nay , saith he , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.584

he shall never be crowned ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.585

for <font> Don Raleigh <$$font> and <font> Don Cobham <$$font> will cut
his Throat ere that Day come . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.586

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> What infer you upon this ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.587

<font> Attorn. <$$font> That your Treason hath Wings .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.588

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> If <font> Cobham <$$font> did practise with
<font> Aremberg <$$font> , how could it not but be known in <font> Spain
? <$$font> RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.589

Why did they name the Duke of <font> Buckingham <$$font> with <font>
Jack Straw's <$$font> Treason , and the Duke of <font> York <$$font>
with <font> Jack Cade <$$font> , but that it was to countenance his
Treason ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.590

Consider you Gentlemen of the Jury , there is no Cause so doubtful which
the King's Counsel can@ @not make good against the Law .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.591

Consider my Disability , and their Ability :
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.592

They prove nothing against me , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.593

only they bring the Accusation of my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> , which
he hath lamented and repented as heartily , as if it had been for an
horrible Murder : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.594

for he knew that all this Sorrow which should come to me , is by his
means . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.595

Presumptions must proceed from precedent or subsequent Facts .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.596

I have spent 40000 Crowns against the <font> Spaniard <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.597

I had not purchased 40 Pound a Year . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.598

If I had died in <font> Guiana <$$font> , I had not left 300 Marks a
Year to my Wife and Son . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.599

I that have always condemned the <font> Spanish <$$font> Faction , me@
@thinks it is a strange thing that now I should affect it !
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,215.C2.600

<P_I,216.C1>

Remember what St. <font> Austin <$$font> says ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.602

Sic judicate tanquam ab alio mox judicandi ; unus judex , unum Tribunal
. RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.603

If you would be contented on Presumptions to be delivered up to be
slaughtered , to have your Wives and Children turned into the Streets to
beg their Bread ; if you would be contented to be so judged , judge so
of me . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.604

<font> Serj. Philips . <$$font> I hope to make this so clear , as that
the Wit of Man shall have no Colour to answer it .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.605

The Matter is Treason in the highest Degree , the End to deprive the
King of his Crown . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.606

The particular Treasons are these : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.607

First , to raise up Rebellion , and to effect that , to procure Money ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.608

to raise up Tumults in <font> Scotland <$$font> , by divulging a
treasonable Book against the King's Right to the Crown ;
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.609

the purpose , to take away the Life of his Majesty and his Issue .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.610

My Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> confesseth Sir <font> Walter Raleigh
<$$font> to be quilty of all these Treasons .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.611

The Question is , whether he be guilty as joining with him , or
instigating of him ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.612

The Course to prove this , was by my Lord <font> Cobham@ @'s <$$font>
Accusation . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.613

If that be true , he is guilty ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.614

if not , he is clear . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.615

So whether <font> Cobham <$$font> say true , or <font> Raleigh <$$font>
, that is the Question . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.616

<font> Raleigh <$$font> hath no Answer , but the Shadow of as much Wit ,
as the Wit of Man can devise . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.617

He useth his bare Denial ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.618

the Denial of a Defendant must not move the Jury .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.619

In the Star-Chamber , or in the Chancery , for matter of Title , if the
Defendant be called in question , his Denial on his Oath is no Evidence
to the Court to clear him , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.620

he doth it in propria causa ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.621

therefore much less in Matters of Treason .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.622

<font> Cobham's <$$font> Testification against him before then , and
since , hath been largely discoursed . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.623

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> If Truth be constant , and Constancy be in
Truth , why hath he forsworn that that he hath said ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.624

You have not proved any one thing against me by direct Proofs , but all
by Circumstances . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.625

<font> Attorn. <$$font> Have you done ? RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.626

The King must have the last . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.627

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> Nay , Mr. Attorney , he which speaketh for
his Life , must speak last . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.628

False Repetitions and Mistakings must not mar my Cause .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.629

You should speak secundum allegata & probata .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.630

I appeal to God and the King in this Point , whether <font> Cobham's
<$$font> Accusation be sufficient to condemn me ?
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.631

agree . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.632

I protest before God , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.633

I never knew a clearer Treason . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.634

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I never had Intelligence with <font> Cobham
<$$font> since I came to the <font> Tower <$$font> .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.635

<font> Attorn. <$$font> Go to , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.636

I will lay thee upon thy Back , for the confidentest Traitor that ever
came at a Bar . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.637

Why should you take 8000 Crowns for a Peace ?

<font> Ld. Cecil . <$$font> Be not so impatient , good Mr. <font>
Attorney <$$font> , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.639

give him leave to speak . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.640

<font> Attorney . <$$font> If I may not be patiently heard , you will
encourage Traitors , and discourage us . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.641

I am the King's sworn Servant , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.642

and must speak : RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.643

<font> Note <$$font> , Here Mr. Attorney sat down in a Chase ,

and would speak no more , until the Commissioners urged and intreated
him . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.647

After much ado , he went on , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.648

and made a long Repetition of all the Evidence , for the Direction of
the Jury ; RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.649

and at the repeating of some things , Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>
interrupted him , RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.650

and said , he did him wrong . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C1.651

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Thou art the most vile and execrable Traitor
that ever lived . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C2.653

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> You speak indiscreetly , barbarously and
uncivilly . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C2.654

<font> Attorney . <$$font> I want Words sufficient to express thy
viperous Treasons . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C2.655

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> I think you want Words indeed ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C2.656

for you have spoken one thing half_a_dozen times .
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C2.657

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Thou art an odious Fellow ,
RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C2.658

thy Name is hateful to all the Realm of <font> England <$$font> for thy
Pride . RALEIGH-1600-E2-H,I,216.C2.659

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> It will go near to prove a measuring Cast
between you and me , Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> .
