<P_2>

<font> Aim. <$$font> You@ @'re my Landlord , I suppose ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.36

<font> Bon. <$$font> Yes , Sir , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.37

I@ @'m old <font> Will. Bonniface <$$font> , pretty well known upon
this Road , as the saying is . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.38

<font> Aim. <$$font> O Mr. <font> Bonniface <$$font> , your Servant .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.39

<font> Bon. <$$font> O Sir - What will your Honour please to drink , as
the saying is ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.40

<font> Aim. <$$font> I have heard your Town of <font> Litchfield
<$$font> much fam'd for Ale , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.41

I think I@ @'ll taste that . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.42

<font> Bon. <$$font> Sir , I have now in my Cellar Ten Tun of the best
Ale in <font> Staffordshire <$$font> ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.43

't@ @is smooth as Oil , sweet as Milk , clear as Amber , and strong as
Brandy ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.44

and will be just Fourteen Year old the Fifth Day of next <font> March
<$$font> old Stile . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.45

<font> Aim. <$$font> You@ @'re very exact , I find , in the Age of your
Ale . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.46

<font> Bon. <$$font> As punctual , Sir , as I am in the Age of my
Children : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.47

I@ @'ll shew you such Ale - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.48

Here , Tapster , broach Number 1706 . as the saying is ; -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.49

Sir , you shall taste my Anno Domini ; - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.50

I have liv'd in <font> Litchfield <$$font> Man and Boy above
Eight_and_fifty Years , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.51

and I believe have not consum'd Eight_and_fifty Ounces of Meat .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.52

<font> Aim. <$$font> At a Meal , you mean , if one may guess your Sense
by your Bulk . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.53

<font> Bon. <$$font> Not in my Life , Sir , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.54

I have fed purely upon Ale ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.55

I have eat my Ale , drank my Ale , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.56

and I always sleep upon Ale . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.57

<font> Enter Tapster with a Bottle and Glass . <$$font>
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.58

Now , Sir , you shall see FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.59

<paren> <font> filling it out <$$font> <$$paren> your Worship's Health ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.60

ha ! delicious , delicious , - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.61

fancy it <font> Burgundy <$$font> , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.62

only fancy it , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.63

and 't@ @is worth Ten Shillings a Quart . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.64

<font> Aim. <$$font> <paren> <font> Drinks . <$$font> <$$paren>
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.65

'T@ @is confounded strong . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.66

<font> Bon. <$$font> Strong ! FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.67

It must be so , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.68

or how should we be strong that drink it ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.69

<font> Aim. <$$font> And have you liv'd so long upon this Ale ,
Landlord ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.70

<font> Bon. <$$font> Eight_and_fifty Years , upon my Credit , Sir ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.71

but it kill'd my Wife , poor Woman , as the saying is .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.72

<font> Aim. <$$font> How came that to pass ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.73

<font> Bon. <$$font> I do@ @n't know how , Sir ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.74

she would not let the Ale take its natural Course , Sir ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.75

she was for qualifying it every now and then with a Dram , as the saying
is ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.76

and an honest Gentleman that came this way from <font> Ireland <$$font>
, made her a Present of a_dozen Bottles of Usquebaugh -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.77

But the poor Woman was never well after : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.78

But howe're , I was obliged to the Gentleman , you know .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.79

<font> Aim. <$$font> Why , was it the Usquebaugh that kill'd her ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,2.80

<P_3>

<font> Bon. <$$font> My Lady <font> Bountyful <$$font> said so , -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.82

She , good Lady , did what could be done , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.83

she cured her of Three Tympanies , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.84

but the Fourth carry'd her off ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.85

but she@ @'s happy , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.86

and I@ @'m contented , as the saying is . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.87

<font> Aim. <$$font> Who@ @'s that Lady <font> Bountyful <$$font> , you
mention'd ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.88

<font> Bon. <$$font> Ods my life , Sir , we@ @'ll drink her Health .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.89

<paren> <font> Drinks <$$font> <$$paren> FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.90

My Lady <font> Bountyful <$$font> is one of the best of Women :
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.91

Her last Husband Sir <font> Charles Bountyful <$$font> left her worth
a_Thousand Pound a Year ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.92

and I believe she lays out one half on@ @'t in charitable Uses for the
Good of her Neighbours ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.93

she cures Rheumatisms , Ruptures , and broken Shins in Men , Green
Sickness , Obstructions , and Fits of the Mother in Women ; - The
Kings-Evil , Chin-Cough , and Chilblains in Children ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.94

in short , she has cured more People in and about <font> Litchfield
<$$font> within Ten Years than the Doctors have kill'd in Twenty ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.95

and that@ @'s a bold Word . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.96

<font> Aim. <$$font> Has the Lady been any other way useful in her
Generation ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.97

<font> Bon. <$$font> Yes , Sir , She has a Daughter by Sir <font>
Charles <$$font> , the finest Woman in all our Country , and the
greatest Fortune . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.98

She has a Son too by her first Husband Squire <font> Sullen <$$font> ,
who marry'd a fine Lady from <font> London <$$font> t'@ @other day ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.99

if you please , Sir , we@ @'ll drink his Health ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.100

<font> Aim. <$$font> What sort of a Man is he ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.101

<font> Bon. <$$font> Why , Sir , the Man@ @'s well enough ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.102

says little , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.103

thinks less , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.104

and does - nothing at all , Faith : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.105

But he@ @'s a Man of great Estate , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.106

and values no Body . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.107

<font> Aim. <$$font> A Sportsman , I suppose .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.108

<font> Bon. <$$font> Yes , Sir , he@ @'s a Man of Pleasure ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.109

he plays at Whisk , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.110

and smoaks his Pipe Eight_and_forty Hours together sometimes .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.111

<font> Aim. <$$font> And marry'd , you say ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.112

<font> Bon. <$$font> Ay , and to a curious Woman , Sir , -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.113

But he@ @'s a - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.114

He wants it , here , Sir . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.115

<font> Pointing to his Forehead . <$$font> FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.116

<font> Aim. <$$font> He has it there , you mean .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.117

<font> Bon. <$$font> That@ @'s none of my Business ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.118

he@ @'s my Landlord , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.119

and so a Man you know , wou'd not , - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.120

But - I_cod , he@ @'s no better than - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.121

Sir , my humble Service to you . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.122

<paren> <font> Drinks . <$$font> <$$paren> FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.123

Tho' I value not a Farthing what he can do to me ; I pay him his Rent at
Quarter day , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.124

I have a good running Trade , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.125

I have but one Daughter , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.126

and I can give her - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.127

But no matter for that . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.128

<font> Aim. <$$font> You@ @'re very happy , Mr. <font> Bonniface
<$$font> , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.129

pray what other Company have you in Town ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,3.130

<P_4>

<font> Bon. <$$font> A power of fine Ladies , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.132

and then we have the <font> French <$$font> Officers .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.133

<font> Aim. <$$font> O that@ @'s right , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.134

you have a good many of those Gentlemen : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.135

Pray how do you like their Company ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.136

<font> Bon. <$$font> So well , as the saying is , that I cou'd wish we
had as many more of 'em , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.137

they@ @'re full of Money , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.138

and pay double for every thing they have ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.139

they know , Sir , that we pay'd good round Taxes for the taking of 'em ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.140

and so they are willing to reimburse us a little ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.141

one of 'em lodges in my House . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.142

<font> Enter <$$font> Archer . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.143

<font> Arch. <$$font> Landlord , there are some <font> French <$$font>
Gentlemen below that ask for you . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.144

<font> Bon. <$$font> I@ @'ll wait on 'em ; - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.145

Does your Master stay long in Town , as the saying is ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.146

<font> To <$$font> Archer . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.147

<font> Arch. <$$font> I ca@ @n't tell , as the saying is .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.148

<font> Bon. <$$font> Come from <font> London <$$font> ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.149

<font> Arch. <$$font> No . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.150

<font> Bon. <$$font> Going to <font> London <$$font> , may_hap ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.151

<font> Arch. <$$font> No . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.152

<font> Bon. <$$font> An odd Fellow this . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.153

I beg your Worship's Pardon , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.154

I@ @'ll wait on you in half a Minute . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.155

<font> Exit . <$$font> FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.156

<font> Aim. <$$font> The Coast@ @'s clear , I see , -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.157

Now my dear <font> Archer <$$font> , welcome to <font> Litchfield
<$$font> . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.158

<font> Arch. <$$font> I thank thee , my dear Brother in Iniquity .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.159

<font> Aim. <$$font> Iniquity ! FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.160

pri@ @thee leave Canting , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.161

you need not change your Stile with your Dress .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.162

<font> Arch. <$$font> Do@ @n't mistake me , <font> Aimwell <$$font> ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.163

for 't@ @is still my Maxim , that there is no Scandal like Rags , nor
any Crime so shameful as Poverty . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.164

<font> Aim. <$$font> The World confesses it every Day in its Practice ,
tho' Men wo@ @n't own it for their Opinion : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.165

Who did that worthy Lord , my Brother , single out of the Side-box to
sup with him t'@ @other Night ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.166

<font> Arch. <$$font> <font> Jack Handycraft <$$font> , a handsom ,
well dress'd , mannerly , sharping Rogue , who keeps the best Company in
Town . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.167

<font> Aim. <$$font> Right , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.168

and pray who marry'd my Lady <font> Manslaughter <$$font> t'@ @other Day
, the great Fortune ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.169

<font> Arch. <$$font> Why , <font> Nick Marrabone <$$font> , a
profess'd Pick-pocket , and a good Bowler ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.170

but he makes a handsom Figure , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.171

and rides in his Coach , that he formerly used to ride behind .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,4.172

<P_5>

<font> Aim. <$$font> But did you observe poor <font> Jack Generous
<$$font> in the Park last Week ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.174

<font> Arch. <$$font> Yes , with his Autumnal Perriwig , shading his
melancholly Face , his Coat older than any thing but its Fashion , with
one Hand idle in his Pocket , and with the other picking his useless
Teeth ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.175

and tho' the Mall was crowded with Company , yet was poor <font> Jack
<$$font> as single and solitary as a Lyon in a Desart .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.176

<font> Aim. <$$font> And as much avoided , for no Crime upon Earth but
the want of Money . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.177

<font> Arch. <$$font> And that@ @'s enough ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.178

Men must not be poor , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.179

Idleness is the Root of all Evil ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.180

the World@ @'s wide enough , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.181

let 'em bustle ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.182

Fortune has taken the weak under her Protection ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.183

but Men of Sense are left to their Industry . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.184

<font> Aim. <$$font> Upon which Topick we proceed ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.185

and I think luckily hitherto : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.186

Wou'd not any Man swear now that I am a Man of Quality , and you my
Servant , when if our intrinsick Value were known -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.187

<font> Arch. <$$font> Come , come , we are the Men of intrinsick Value
, who can strike our Fortunes out of our selves , whose worth is
independent of Accidents in Life , or Revolutions in Government ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.188

we have Heads to get Money , and Hearts to spend it .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.189

<font> Aim. <$$font> As to our Hearts , I grant ye {SIC:grant'ye} ,
they are as willing Tits as any within Twenty Degrees ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.190

but I can have no great opinion of our Heads from the Service they have
done us hitherto , unless it be that they have brought us from <font>
London <$$font> hither to <font> Litchfield <$$font> , made me a Lord ,
and you my Servant . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.191

<font> Arch. <$$font> That@ @'s more than you cou'd expect already .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.192

But what Money have we left ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.193

<font> Aim. <$$font> But Two_hundred Pound . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.194

<font> Arch. <$$font> And our Horses , Cloaths , Rings , &c.
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.195

why we have very good Fortunes now for moderate People ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.196

and let me tell you , besides Thousand , that this Two_hundred Pound ,
with the experience that we are now Masters of , is a better Estate than
the Ten we have spent . - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.197

Our Friends indeed began to suspect that our Pockets were low ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.198

but we came off with flying Colours , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.199

shew'd no signs of want either in Word or Deed .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.200

<font> Aim. <$$font> Ay , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.201

and our going to <font> Brussels <$$font> was a good Pretence enough for
our sudden disappearing ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.202

and I warrant you , our Friends imagine that we are gone a volunteering
. FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,5.203

<font> Arch. <$$font> Why Faith , if this Prospect fails , it must e'en
come to <P_6> that , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.204

I am for venturing one of the Hundreds if you will upon this
Knight-Errantry ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.205

but in case it should fail , we@ @'ll reserve the t'@ @other to carry us
to some Counterscarp , where we may die as we liv'd in a Blaze .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.206

<font> Aim. <$$font> With all my Heart ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.207

and we have liv'd justly , <font> Archer <$$font> ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.208

we ca@ @n't say that we have spent our Fortunes , but that we have
enjoy'd 'em . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.209

<font> Arch. <$$font> Right , so much Pleasure for so much Money ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.210

we have had our Penyworths , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.211

and had I Millions , I wou'd go to the same Market again .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.212

O <font> London , London ! <$$font> FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.213

well , we have had our share , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.214

and let us be thankful ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.215

Past Pleasures , for ought I know are best , such as we are sure of ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.216

those to come may disappoint us . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.217

<font> Aim. <$$font> It has often griev'd the Heart of me , to see how
some inhumane Wretches murther their kind Fortunes ; those that by
sacrificing all to one Appetite , shall starve all the rest . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.218

You shall have some that live only in their Palates , and in their sense
of tasting shall drown the other Four : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.219

Others are only Epicures in Appearances , such who shall starve their
Nights to make a Figure a Days , and famish their own to feed the Eyes
of others : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.220

A contrary Sort confine their Pleasure to the dark ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.221

and contract their spacious Acres to the Circuit of a Muff-string .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.222

<font> Arch. <$$font> Right ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.223

but they find the <font> Indies <$$font> in that Spot where they consume
'em , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.224

and I think your kind Keepers have much the best on@ @'t ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.225

for they indulge the most Senses by one Expence ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.226

there@ @'s the Seeing , Hearing , and Feeling amply gratify'd ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.227

and some Philosophers will tell you , that from such a Commerce there
arises a sixth Sense that gives infinitely more Pleasure than the other
five put together . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.228

<font> Aim. <$$font> And to pass to the other Extremity , of all
Keepers , I think those the worst that keep their Money .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.229

<font> Arch. <$$font> Those are the most miserable Wights in being ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.230

they destroy the Rights of Nature , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.231

and disappoint the Blessings of Providence : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.232

Give me a Man that keeps his Five Senses keen and bright as his Sword ,
that has 'em always drawn out in their just order and strength , with
his Reason as Commander at the Head of 'em , that detaches 'em by turns
upon whatever Party of Pleasure agreeably offers , and commands 'em to
retreat upon the least Appearance of Disadvantage or Danger : -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,6.233

For my part I can stick to my Bottle , while my Wine , my Company , and
my <P_7> Reason holds good ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,7.234

I can be charm'd with <font> Sappho's <$$font> singing without falling
in Love with her Face ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,7.235

I love Hunting , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,7.236

but wou'd not , like <font> Acteon <$$font> , be eaten up by my own Dogs
; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,7.237

I love a fine House , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,7.238

but let another keep it ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,7.239

and just so I love a fine Woman . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-H,7.240

<font> Aim. <$$font> In that last particular you have the better of me
