I warrant he hath a_thousand of these Letters , writ with blancke-space
for different names <paren> sure more <$$paren> :
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,44.C1.74

and these are of the second edition : SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,44.C1.75

for he cares not what hee puts into the presse , when he would put vs

I had rather be a Giantesse , and lye vnder Mount <font> Pelion <$$font>

Well ; I will find you twentie lasciuious Turtles ere one chaste man .

SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,44.C1.82

<font> Mi. Ford . <$$font> Nay , I wil consent to act any villany

SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,44.C1.92

oh that my husband saw this Letter : SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,44.C1.93

hee@ @'s as farre from iealousie , as I am from giuing him cause ,
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,44.C1.96

and that <paren> I hope <$$paren> is an vnmeasurable distance .
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,44.C1.97

<font> Mis. Ford . <$$font> You are the happier woman .
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,44.C1.98

I doe not thinke the Knight would offer it : SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,44.C2.175

But these that accuse him in his intent towards our wiues , are a yoake
of his discarded men : very rogues , SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,44.C2.176

<font> Fal. <$$font> Well Sir . SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.408

<font> Ford . <$$font> I haue long lou'd her , and I protest to you ,
bestowed much on her : followed her with a doating obseruance :
Ingross'd opportunities to meete her : fee'd euery slight occasion that
could but nigardly giue mee sight of her : not only bought many presents
to giue her , SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.409

but haue giuen largely to many , to know what shee would haue giuen :
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.410

briefly , I haue pursu'd her , as Loue hath pursued mee , which hath
beene on the wing of all occasions : SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.411

but whatsoeuer I haue merited , either in my minde , or in my meanes ,
meede I am sure I haue receiued none , vnlesse Experience be a Iewell ,
that I haue purchased at an infinite rate , and that hath taught mee to
say this , SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.412

<font> Loue like a shadow flies , when substance Loue pursues , Pursuing
that that flies , and flying what pursues . <$$font>
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.413

<font> Fal. <$$font> Haue you receiu'd no promise of satisfaction at

<font> Fal. <$$font> Of what qualitie was your loue then ?
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.418

<font> Ford . <$$font> Like a fair house , built on another mans ground
, so that I haue lost my edifice , by mistaking the place , where I
erected it . SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.419

<font> Fal. <$$font> To what purpose haue you vnfolded this to me ?
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.420

<font> For. <$$font> When I haue told you that , I haue told you all :
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.421

Some say , that though she appeare honest to mee , yet in other places
shee enlargeth her mirth so farre , that there is shrewd construction
made of her . SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.422

Now <paren> Sir <font> Iohn <$$font> <$$paren> here is the heart of my
purpose : SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.423

you are a gentleman of excellent breeding , admirable discourse , of
great admittance , authenticke in your place and person , generally
allow'd for your many war-like , court-like , and learned preparations .
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.424

<font> Fal. <$$font> O Sir . SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.425

<font> Ford . <$$font> Beleeue it , SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,46.C2.426

lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this <font> Fords <$$font> wife :
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,47.C1.432

SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,47.C1.436

Me@ @thinkes you prescribe to your selfe very preposterously .
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,47.C1.437

<font> Ford . <$$font> O , vnderstand my drift :
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,47.C1.438

she dwells so securely on the excellency of her honor , that the folly
of my soule dares not present it selfe : SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,47.C1.439

shee is too bright to be look'd against . SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,47.C1.440

Now , could I come to her with any detection in my hand ; my desires had
instance and argument to commend themselues ,
SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,47.C1.441

I could driue her then from the ward of her purity , her reputation ,
her marriage-vow , and a_thousand other her defences , which now are too
- too strongly embattaild against me : SHAKESP-1599-E2-H,47.C1.442

They say the iealous wittolly-knaue hath masses of money , for the which
