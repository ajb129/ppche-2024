In the beginning was the Word , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.7

& the Word was with God , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.8

and the Word was God . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.9

2 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.10

The same was in the beginning with God . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.11

3 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.12

All things were made by him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.13

and without him was not any thing made that was made .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.14

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.15

In him was life , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.16

and the life was the light of men . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.17

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.18

And the light shineth in darknesse , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.19

and the darknesse comprehended it not . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.20

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.21

There was a man sent from God , whose name was Iohn .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.22

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.23

The same came for a witnesse , to beare witnesse of the light , that all
men through him might beleeue . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.24

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.25

Hee was not that light , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.26

but <font> was sent <$$font> to beare witnesse of that light .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.27

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.28

That was the true light , which lighteth euery man that commeth into the
world . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.29

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.30

Hee was in the world , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.31

and the world was made by him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.32

and the world knew him not . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.33

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.34

Hee came vnto his owne , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.35

and his owne receiued him not . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.36

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.37

But as many as receiued him , to them gaue hee power to become the
sonnes of God , <font> euen <$$font> to them that beleeue on his Name :
13 Which were borne , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor
of the will of man , but of God . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.38

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.39

And the Word was made flesh , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.40

and dwelt among vs <paren> & we beheld his glory , the glory as of the
onely begotten of the Father <$$paren> full of grace and trueth .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.41

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.42

Iohn bare witnesse of him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.43

and cried , saying , This was he of whom I spake ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.44

He that commeth after me , is preferred before me ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.45

for he was before me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.46

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.47

And of his fulnesse haue all wee receiued , and grace for grace .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.48

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.49

For the Law was giuen by Moses , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.50

but grace and trueth came by Iesus Christ . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.51

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.52

No man hath seene God at any time : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.53

the onely begotten Sonne , which is in the bosome of the Father , he
hath declared him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.54

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.55

And this is the record of Iohn , when the Iewes sent Priests and Leuites
from Hierusalem , to aske him , Who art thou ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,1J.56

<P_1,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.58

And he confessed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.59

and denied not : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.60

but confessed , I am not the Christ . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.61

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.62

And they asked him , What then ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.63

Art thou Elias ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.64

And he saith , I am not . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.65

Art thou that Prophet ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.66

And hee answered , No . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.67

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.68

Then said they vnto him , Who art thou , that we may giue an answere to
them that sent vs ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.69

What sayest thou of thy selfe ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.70

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.71

He said , I <font> am <$$font> the voice of one crying in the
wildernesse : Make straight the way of the Lord , as said the Prophet
Esaias . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.72

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.73

And they which were sent , were of the Pharises .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.74

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.75

And they asked him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.76

and said vnto him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ
, nor Elias , neither that Prophet ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.77

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.78

Iohn answered them , saying , I baptize with water ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.79

but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.80

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.81

He it is , who comming after me , is preferred before me , whose shoes
latchet I am not worthy to vnloose . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.82

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.83

These things were done in Bethabara beyond Iordane , where Iohn was
baptizing . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.84

29 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.85

The next day , Iohn seeth Iesus comming vnto him ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.86

and saith , Behold the Lambe of God , which taketh away the sinne of the
world . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.87

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.88

This is he of whom I said , After me commeth a man , which is preferred
before me : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.89

for he was before me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.90

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.91

And I knew him not : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.92

but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therfore am I come
baptizing with water . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.93

32 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.94

And Iohn bare record saying , I saw the Spirit descending from heauen ,
like a Doue , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.95

and it abode vpon him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.96

33 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.97

And I knew him not : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.98

but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said vnto me , Vpon
whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending , & remaining on him , the
same is he which baptizeth with the holy Ghost .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.99

34 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.100

And I saw , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.101

. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.106

37 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.107

And the two disciples heard him speake , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.108

and they followed Iesus . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.109

38 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.110

and saw them following , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.112

and saith vnto them , What seeke ye ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.113

They said vnto him , Rabbi , <paren> which is to say being interpreted ,
Master <$$paren> where dwellest thou ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,20J.114

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,40J.128

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,1,40J.129

make not my fathers house an house of merchandize .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,2,1J.207

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,2,1J.208

And his disciples remembred that it was written , The zeale of thine
house hath eaten me vp . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,2,1J.209

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,2,1J.210

and said vnto him , What signe shewest thou vnto vs , seeing that thou
doest these things ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,2,1J.212

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,2,1J.213

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,2,20J.228

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,2,20J.229

And needed not that any should testifie of man :

He that beleeueth on him , is not condemned : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,3,1J.281

When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Iesus made
and baptized moe disciples then Iohn {made_and_baptized} , 2 <paren>
Though Iesus himselfe baptized not , but his disciples : <$$paren> 3 He
left Iudea , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.344

and departed againe into Galile . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.345

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.346

And hee must needs goe thorow Samaria . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.347

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.348

Then commeth he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , neere to
the parcell of ground that Iacob gaue to his sonne Ioseph .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.349

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.350

Now Iacobs Well was there . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.351

Iesus therefore being wearied with his iourney , sate thus on the Well :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.352

and it was about the sixth houre . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.353

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.354

There commeth a woman of Samaria to draw water :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.355

Iesus sayth vnto her , Giue me to drinke . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.356

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.357

For his disciples were gone away vnto the city to buy meate .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.358

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.359

Then saith the woman of Samaria vnto him , How is it that thou , being a
Iewe , askest drinke of me , which am a woman of Samaria ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.360

For the Iewes haue no dealings with the Samaritanes .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.361

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.362

Iesus answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.363

and said vnto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that
sayth to thee , Giue me to drinke ; thou wouldest haue asked of him ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.364

and hee would haue giuen thee liuing water . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.365

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.366

The woman saith vnto him , Sir , thou hast nothing to drawe with ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.367

and the Well is deepe : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.368

from whence then hast thou that liuing water ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.369

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.370

Art thou greater then our father Iacob , which gaue vs the Well , and
dranke thereof himselfe , and his children , and his cattell ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.371

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.372

Iesus answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.373

and said vnto her , Whosoeuer drinketh of this water , shall thirst
againe : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.374

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.375

But whosoeuer drinketh of the water that I shal giue him , shall neuer
thirst : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.376

but the water that I shall giue him , shal@ @be in him a well of water
springing vp into euerlasting life . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.377

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.378

The woman saith vnto him , Sir , giue me this water , that I thirst not
, neither come hither to draw . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.379

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.380

Iesus saith vnto her , Goe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.381

call thy husband , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.382

and come hither . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.383

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.384

The woman answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.385

and said , I haue no husband . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.386

Iesus said vnto her , Thou hast well said , I haue no husband :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.387

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.388

For thou hast had fiue husbands , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.389

and he whom thou now hast , is not thy husband :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.390

In that saidest thou truely . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.391

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.392

The woman saith vnto him , Sir , I perceiue that thou art a Prophet .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,1J.393

<P_4,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.395

Our fathers worshipped in this mountaine , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.396

and ye say , that in Hierusalem is the place where men ought to worship
. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.397

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.398

Iesus saith vnto her , Woman , beleeue me , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.399

the houre commeth when ye shall neither in this mountaine , nor yet at
Hierusalem , worship the Father . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.400

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.401

Ye worship ye know not what : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.402

we know what we worship : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.403

for saluation is of the Iewes . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.404

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.405

But the houre commeth , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.406

and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in
spirit , and in trueth : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.407

for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.408

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.409

God is a Spirit , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.410

and they that worship him , must worship him in spirit , and in trueth .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.411

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.412

The woman saith vnto him , I know that Messias commeth , which is called
Christ : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.413

when he is come , hee will tell vs all things .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.414

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.415

Iesus sayth vnto her , I that speake vnto thee , am hee .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.416

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.417

And vpon this came his disciples , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.418

and marueiled that he talked with the woman :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.419

yet no man said , What seekest thou , or , Why talkest thou with her ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.420

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.421

The woman then left her waterpot , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.422

and went her way into the city , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.423

and sayth to the men , 29 Come , see a man , which tolde me all things
that euer I did : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.424

Is not this the Christ ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.425

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.426

Then they went out of the citie , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.427

and came vnto him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.428

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.429

In the meane while his disciples prayed him , saying , Master , eate .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.430

32 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.431

But hee said vnto them , I haue meate to eate that ye know not of .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.432

33 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.433

Therefore said the disciples one to another , Hath any man brought him
ought to eate ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.434

34 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.435

Iesus saith vnto them , My meat is , to doe the will of him that sent
mee , and to finish his worke . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.436

35 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.437

Say not ye , There are yet foure moneths , and then commeth haruest ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.438

Behold , I say vnto you , Lift vp your eyes ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.439

and looke on the fields : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.440

for they are white already to haruest . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.441

36 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.442

And hee that reapeth receiueth wages , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.443

and gathereth fruite vnto life eternall : that both he that soweth , and
he that reapeth , may reioyce together . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.444

37 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.445

And herein is that saying true : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.446

One soweth , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.447

and another reapeth . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.448

38 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.449

I sent you to reape that , whereon ye bestowed no labour :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.450

other men laboured , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.451

and yee are entred into their labours . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.452

39 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.453

And many of the Samaritanes of that citie beleeued on him , for the
saying of the woman , which testified , Hee told me all that euer I did
. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,20J.454

<P_4,40J>

40 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.456

So when the Samaritanes were come vnto him , they besought him that he
would tarie with them , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.457

and he abode there two dayes . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.458

41 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.459

And many moe beleeued , because of his owne word :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.460

42 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.461

And said vnto the woman , Now we beleeue , not because of thy saying ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.462

for we haue heard him our selues , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.463

and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Sauiour of the world .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.464

43 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.465

Now after two dayes he departed thence , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.466

and went into Galilee : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.467

44 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.468

For Iesus himselfe testified , that a Prophet hath no honour in his owne
countrey . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.469

45 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.470

Then when hee was come into Galilee , the Galileans receiued him ,
hauing seene all the things that hee did at Hierusalem at the Feast :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.471

for they also went vnto the Feast . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.472

46 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.473

So Iesus came againe into Cana of Galilee , where hee made the water
wine . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.474

And there was a certaine noble man , whose sonne was sicke at Capernaum
. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.475

47 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.476

When he heard that Iesus was come out of Iudea into Galilee , hee went
vnto him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.477

and besought him that he would come downe , and heale his sonne :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.478

for he was at the point of death . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.479

48 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.480

Then said Iesus vnto him , Except ye see signes and wonders , yee will
not beleeue . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.481

49 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.482

The noble man saith vnto him , Syr , come downe ere my child die .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.483

50 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.484

Iesus saith vnto him , Go thy way , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.485

thy sonne liueth . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.486

And the man beleeued the word that Iesus had spoken vnto him ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.487

and he went his way . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.488

51 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.489

And as he was now going down , his seruants met him ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.490

and told him , saying , Thy sonne liueth . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.491

52 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.492

Then inquired hee of them the houre when he began to amend :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.493

and they said vnto him , Yesterday at the seuenth houre the feuer left
him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.494

53 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.495

So the father knewe that it was at the same houre , in the which Iesus
said vnto him , Thy sonne liueth , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.496

and himselfe beleeued , and his whole house .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,4,40J.497

This is againe the second miracle that Iesus did , when hee was come out

After this there was a feast of the Iewes , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.505

and Iesus went vp to Hierusalem . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.506

2 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.507

Now there is at Hierusalem by the sheepe <font> market <$$font> , a
poole , which is called in the Hebrew tongue <font> Bethesda <$$font> ,
hauing fiue porches . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.508

3 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.509

In these lay a great multitude of impotent folke , of blind , halt ,
withered , waiting for the mouing of the water .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.510

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.511

For an Angel went downe at a certaine season into the poole ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.512

and troubled the water : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.513

whosoeuer then first after the troubling of the water stepped in , was
made whole of whatsoeuer disease he had . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.514

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.515

And a certaine man was there , which had an infirmitie thirtie_and_eight
yeeres . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.516

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.517

When Iesus saw him lie , & knew that hee had beene now a long time in
that case , he sayth vnto him , Wilt thou be made whole ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.518

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.519

The impotent man answered him , Sir , I haue no man when the water is
troubled , to put mee into the poole : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.520

but while I am comming , another steppeth downe before me .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.521

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.522

Iesus sayth vnto him , Rise , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.523

take vp thy bed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.524

and walke . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.525

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.526

And immediatly the man was made whole , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.527

and tooke vp his bed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.528

and walked : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.529

And on the same day was the Sabbath . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.530

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.531

The Iewes therefore said vnto him that was cured , It is the Sabbath day
, AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.532

it is not lawfull for thee to cary thy bed . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.533

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.534

He answered them , He that made me whole , the same said vnto me , Take
vp thy bed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.535

and walke ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.536

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.537

Then asked they him , What man is that which said vnto thee , Take vp
thy bed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.538

and walke ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.539

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.540

And he that was healed , wist not who it was :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.541

for Iesus had conueyed himselfe away , a multitude being in that place .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.542

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.543

Afterward Iesus findeth him in the Temple , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.544

& said vnto him , Behold , thou art made whole :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.545

sinne no more , lest a worse thing come vnto thee .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.546

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.547

The man departed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.548

and tolde the Iewes that it was Iesus which had made him whole .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.549

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.550

And therefore did the Iewes persecute Iesus , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.551

and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the Sabbath
day . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.552

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.553

But Iesus answered them , My Father worketh hitherto ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.554

& I worke . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.555

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.556

Therefore the Iewes sought the more to kill him , not onely because hee
had broken the Sabbath , but said also , that God was his father ,
making himselfe equall with God . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.557

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.558

Then answered Iesus , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.559

and saide vnto them , Verily , verily I say vnto you , The sonne can doe
nothing of himselfe , but what he seeth the Father doe :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.560

for what things soeuer he doeth , these also doth the sonne likewise .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,1J.561

<P_5,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.563

For the father loueth the sonne , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.564

and sheweth him all things that himselfe doth :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.565

& he will shew him greater works then these , that ye may marueile .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.566

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.567

For as the Father raiseth vp the dead , and quickeneth them : euen so
the Sonne quickeneth whom he will . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.568

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.569

For the Father iudgeth no man : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.570

but hath committed all iudgement vnto the Sonne : 23 That all men should
honour the Son , euen as they honour the Father .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.571

He that honoureth not y=e= Sonne , honoreth not y=e= Father which hath
sent him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.572

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.573

Verily , verily I say vnto you , Hee that heareth my word , & beleeueth
on him that sent mee , hath euerlasting life ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.574

and shall not come into condemnation : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.575

but is passed from death vnto life . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.576

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.577

Verily , verily I say vnto you , The houre is comming ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.578

& now is , when the dead shall heare the voice of the Sonne of God :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.579

and they that heare , shall liue . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.580

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.581

For as the Father hath life in himselfe : so hath he giuen to the Sonne
to haue life in himselfe : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.582

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.583

And hath giuen authority to execute iudgement also , because he is the
Sonne of man . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.584

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.585

Marueile not at this : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.586

for the houre is comming , in the which all that are in the graues shall
heare his voice , 29 And shall come foorth , they that haue done good ,
vnto the resurrection of life , and they that haue done euill , vnto the
resurrection of damnation . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.587

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.588

I can of mine owne selfe doe nothing : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.589

as I heare , I iudge : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.590

and my iudgement is iust , because I seeke not mine owne will , but the
will of the Father , which hath sent me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.591

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.592

If I beare witnesse of my selfe , my witnesse is not true .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.593

32 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.594

There is another that beareth witnesse of me ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.595

& I know that the witnesse which he witnesseth of me , is true .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.596

33 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.597

Ye sent vnto Iohn , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.598

and he bare witnesse vnto the trueth . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.599

34 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.600

But I receiue not testimonie from man : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.601

but these things I say , that ye might be saued .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.602

35 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.603

He was a burning and a shining light : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.604

and ye were willing for a season to reioyce in his light .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.605

36 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.606

But I haue greater witnesse then that of Iohn :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.607

for the workes which the Father hath giuen me to finish , the same
workes that I doe , beare witnesse of mee , that the Father hath sent me
. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.608

37 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.609

And the Father himselfe which hath sent me , hath borne witnesse of me .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.610

Ye haue neither heard his voyce at any time , nor seene his shape .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.611

38 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.612

And ye haue not his word abiding in you : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.613

for whom he hath sent , him ye beleeue not .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.614

39 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.615

Search the Scriptures , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,20J.616

for in them ye thinke ye haue eternall life ,

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,40J.621

I receiue not honour from men . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,40J.623

42 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,40J.624

But I know you , that ye haue not the loue of God in you .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,40J.625

43 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,40J.626

I am come in my Fathers name , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,40J.627

and ye receiue me not : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,40J.628

if another shall come in his owne Name , him ye will receiue .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,40J.629

How can ye beleeue , which receiue honour one of another , & seeke not

45 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,40J.632

Doe not thinke that I will accuse you to the Father :

there is one that accuseth you , euen Moses , in whom ye trust ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,40J.634

For had ye beleeued Moses , ye would haue beleeued me :

for he wrote of me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,5,40J.637

After these things Iesus went ouer the sea of Galilee , which is the sea
of Tiberias : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.645

2 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.646

And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which
hee did on them that were diseased . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.647

3 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.648

And Iesus went vp into a mountaine , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.649

and there hee sate with his disciples . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.650

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.651

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.652

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.653

When Iesus then lift vp his eyes , and saw a great company come vnto him
, he saith vnto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eate
? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.654

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.655

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.657

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.658

Philip answered him , Two_hundred peny-worth of bread is not sufficient
for them , that euery one of them may take a litle .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.659

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.660

One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peters brother , saith vnto him ,
9 There is a lad here , which hath fiue barley loaues , and two small
fishes : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.661

but what are they among so many ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.662

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.663

And Iesus said , Make the men sit downe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.664

Now there was much grasse in the place . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.665

So the men sate downe , in number about fiue_thousand .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.666

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.667

And Iesus tooke the loaues , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.668

and when he had giuen thankes , hee distributed to the disciples , and
the disciples to them that were set downe , and likewise of the fishes ,
as much as they would . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.669

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.670

When they were filled , he said vnto his disciples , Gather vp the
fragments that remaine , that nothing be lost .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.671

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.672

Therefore they gathered them together , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.673

and filled twelue baskets with the fragments of the fiue barley loaues ,
which remained ouer and aboue , vnto them that had eaten .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.674

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.675

Then those men , when they had seene the miracle that Iesus did , said ,
This is of a trueth that Prophet that should come into the world .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.676

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.677

When Iesus therefore perceiued that they would come and take him by
force , to make him a King , hee departed againe into a mountaine ,
himselfe alone . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.678

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.679

And when euen was now come , his disciples went downe vnto the sea ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.680

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.681

And entred into a ship , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.682

and went ouer the sea towards Capernaum : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.683

and it was now darke , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.684

and Iesus was not come to them . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.685

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.686

And the sea arose , by reason of a great winde that blew .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.687

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.688

So when they had rowed about fiue_and_twentie , or thirtie furlongs ,
they see Iesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh vnto the ship :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.689

and they were afraid . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,1J.690

<P_6,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.692

But he saith vnto them , It is I , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.693

be not afraid . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.694

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.695

Then they willingly receiued him into the ship ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.696

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.697

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.698

The day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the
sea , saw that there was none other boat there , saue that one whereinto
his disciples were entred , and that Iesus went not with his disciples
into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone : 23 Howbeit
there came other boats from Tiberias , nigh vnto the place where they
did eate bread , after that the Lord had giuen thankes : 24 When the
people therefore saw that Iesus was not there , neither his disciples ,
they also tooke shipping , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.699

and came to Capernaum , seeking for Iesus . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.700

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.701

And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they saide
vnto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.702

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.703

Iesus answered them , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.704

and said , Verely , verely I say vnto you , Ye seeke me , not because ye
saw the miracles , but because yee did eate of the loaues , and were
filled . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.705

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.706

Labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which
endureth vnto euerlasting life , which the Sonne of man shall giue vnto

for him hath God the Father sealed . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.708

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.709

Then said they vnto him , What shall we doe , that we might worke the
workes of God ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.710

29 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.711

Iesus answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.712

and said vnto them , This is the worke of God , that ye beleeue on him
whom he hath sent . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.713

They said therefore vnto him , What signe shewest thou then , that we
may see , and beleeue thee ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.715

What doest thou worke ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.716

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.717

Our fathers did eate Manna in the desert , as it is written ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.718

He gaue them bread from heauen to eate . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.719

32 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.720

Then Iesus said vnto them , Verely , verely I say vnto you , Moses gaue
you not that bread from heauen , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.721

but my Father giueth you the true bread from heauen .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.722

33 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.723

For the bread of God is hee which commeth downe from heauen , and giueth
life vnto the world . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.724

34 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.725

Then said they vnto him , Lord , euermore giue vs this bread .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.726

35 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.727

And Iesus said vnto them , I am the bread of life :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.728

hee that commeth to me , shall neuer hunger :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.729

and he that beleeueth on me , shall neuer thirst .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.730

36 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.731

But I said vnto you , that ye also haue seene me , and beleeue not .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.732

37 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.733

All that the Father giueth mee , shall come to mee ;
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.734

and him that commeth to me , I will in no wise cast out .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.735

38 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.736

For I came downe from heauen , not to doe mine owne will , but the will
of him that sent me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.737

39 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,20J.738

And this is the Fathers wil which hath sent me , that of all which he

and I will raise him vp at the last day . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.743

41 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.744

The Iewes then murmured at him , because hee said , I am the bread which
came downe from heauen . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.745

42 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.746

And they said , Is not this Iesus the sonne of Ioseph , whose father and

How is it then that hee sayth , I came downe from heauen ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.748

43 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.749

Iesus therefore answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.750

and said vnto them , Murmure not among your selues .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.751

It is written in the Prophets , And they shall be all taught of God .

Euery man therefore {HELSINKI:therefoe} that hath heard , and hath

Not that any man hath seene the Father ; AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.759

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.760

I am that bread of life . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.764

49 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.765

Your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernesse ,

and are dead . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.767

50 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.768

This is the bread which commeth downe from heauen , that a man may eate
thereof , and not die . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.769

51 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.770

I am the liuing bread , which came downe from heauen .

If any man eate of this bread , he shall liue for euer :

52 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.774

The Iewes therefore stroue amongst themselues , saying , How can this
man giue vs his flesh to eate ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.775

53 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.776

Then Iesus sayd vnto them , Verely , verely I say vnto you , Except yee

life in you . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.777

57 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.786

As the liuing Father hath sent me , and I liue by the Father : so , he

58 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.788

These things said hee in the Synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,40J.792

<P_6,60J>

60 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.794

Many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard <font> this
<$$font> , said , This is an hard saying , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.795

who can heare it ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.796

61 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.797

When Iesus knew in himselfe , that his disciples murmured at it , hee
said vnto them , Doeth this offend you ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.798

62 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.799

<font> What <$$font> and if yee shall see the sonne of man ascend vp
where hee was before ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.800

63 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.801

It is the Spirit that quickeneth , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.802

the flesh profiteth nothing : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.803

the wordes that I speake vnto you , they are Spirit ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.804

and they are life . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.805

64 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.806

But there are some of you that beleeue not .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.807

For Iesus knew from the beginning , who they were that beleeued not ,
and who should betray him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.808

65 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.809

And he said , Therefore said I vnto you , that no man can come vnto me ,
except it were giuen vnto him of my Father .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.810

66 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.811

From that time many of his disciples went backe ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.812

and walked no more with him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.813

67 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.814

Then said Iesus vnto the twelue , Will ye also goe away ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.815

68 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.816

Then Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we goe ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.817

Thou hast the words of eternall life . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.818

69 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.819

And we beleeue AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.820

and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Sonne of the liuing God .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.821

70 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.822

Iesus answered them , Haue not I chosen you twelue , and one of you is a
deuill ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.823

71 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.824

He spake of Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,6,60J.825

for hee it was that should betray him , being one of the twelue .

<$$heading>

{COM:introduction_omitted}

After these things , Iesus walked in Galilee :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.832

for hee would not walk in Iurie , because the Iewes sought to kill him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.833

2 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.834

Now the Iewes feast of Tabernacles was at hand .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.835

3 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.836

His brethren therefore saide vnto him , Depart hence ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.837

and go into Iudea , that thy Disciples also may see the works that thou
doest . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.838

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.839

For there is no man that doth any thing in secret , and hee himselfe
seeketh to be knowen openly : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.840

If thou doe these things , shew thy selfe to y=e= world .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.841

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.842

For neither did his brethren beleeue in him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.843

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.844

Then Iesus said vnto them , My time is not yet come :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.845

but your time is alway ready . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.846

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.847

The world can@ @not hate you , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.848

but me it hateth , because I testifie of it , that the workes therof are
euill . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.849

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.850

Goe ye vp vnto this feast : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.851

I goe not vp yet vnto this feast , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.852

for my time is not yet full come . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.853

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.854

When he had said these words vnto them , he abode still in Galilee .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.855

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.856

But when his brethren were gone vp , then went he also vp vnto the feast
, not openly , but as it were in secret . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.857

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.858

Then the Iewes sought him at the feast , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.859

and said , Where is he ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.860

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.861

And there was much murmuring among the people , concerning him :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.862

For some said , Hee is a good man : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.863

Others said , Nay , but he deceiueth the people .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.864

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.865

Howbeit , no man spake openly of him , for feare of the Iewes .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.866

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.867

Now about the middest of the feast , Iesus went vp into the Temple ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.868

and taught . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.869

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.870

And the Iewes marueiled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , hauing
neuer learned ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.871

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.872

Iesus answered them , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.873

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.874

If any man will doe his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether
it be of God , or whether I speake of my selfe .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.875

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.876

He that speaketh of himselfe , seeketh his owne glory :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.877

but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.878

and no vnrighteousnesse is in him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.879

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.880

Did not Moses giue you the Law , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.881

and <font> yet <$$font> none of you keepeth the Law ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.882

Why goe ye about to kill me ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,1J.883

<P_7,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.885

The people answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.886

and sayd , Thou hast a deuill : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.887

Who goeth about to kill thee ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.888

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.889

Iesus answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.890

and saide vnto them , I haue done one worke ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.891

and yee all marueile . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.892

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.893

Moses therefore gaue vnto you Circumcision <paren> not because it is of
Moses , but {because_it_is} of the fathers <$$paren>
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.894

and yee on the Sabbath day circumcise a man .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.895

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.896

If a man on the Sabbath day receiue circumcision , that the Lawe of
Moses should not be broken ; Are ye angry at me , because I haue made a
man euery whit whole on the Sabbath day ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.897

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.898

Iudge not according to the appearance , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.899

but iudge righteous iudgement . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.900

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.901

Then said some of them of Hierusalem , Is not this hee , whome they
seeke to kill ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.902

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.903

But loe , he speaketh boldly , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.904

and they say nothing vnto him : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.905

Doe the rulers know indeede that this is the very Christ ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.906

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.907

Howbeit wee know this man whence he is : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.908

but when Christ commeth , no man knoweth whence he is .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.909

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.910

Then cried Iesus in the Temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.911

and ye know , whence I am , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.912

and I am not come of my selfe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.913

but he that sent me , is true , whom ye know not .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.914

29 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.915

But I know him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.916

for I am from him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.917

and he hath sent me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.918

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.919

Then they sought to take him : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.920

but no man laid hands on him , because his houre was not yet come .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.921

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.922

And many of the people beleeued on him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.923

& said , When Christ commeth , will hee doe moe miracles then these
which this man hath done ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.924

32 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.925

The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him
: AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.926

And the Pharisees and the chiefe Priests sent officers to take him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.927

33 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.928

Then said Iesus vnto them , Yet a litle while am I with you ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.929

and then I goe vnto him that sent me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.930

34 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.931

Ye shall seeke me , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.932

and shall not find me : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.933

and where I am , thither yee can@ @not come .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.934

35 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.935

Then saide the Iewes among themselues , Whither will hee goe , that we
shall not find him ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.936

Will he goe vnto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the
Gentiles ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.937

36 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.938

What maner of saying is this that he said , Ye shall seeke me , and
shall not find me ? and where I am , thither ye can@ @not come ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.939

37 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.940

In the last day , that great day of the feast , Iesus stood ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.941

and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come vnto me , and
drinke . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.942

38 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.943

He that beleeueth on me , as the Scripture hath saide , out of his belly
shall flow riuers of liuing water . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.944

39 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,20J.945

<paren> But this spake he of the Spirit which they that beleeue on him ,

Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , saide , Of
a trueth this is the Prophet . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.950

41 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.951

Others said , This is the Christ . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.952

But some said , Shall Christ come out of Galilee ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.953

42 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.954

Hath not the Scripture saide , that Christ commeth of the seede of Dauid

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.955

43 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.956

So there was a diuision among the people because of him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.957

44 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.958

And some of them would haue taken him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.959

but no man layed hands on him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.960

45 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.961

Then came the officers to the chiefe Priests and Pharises ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.962

and they said vnto them , Why haue ye not brought him ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.963

The officers answered , Neuer man spake like this man .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.965

47 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,7,40J.966

Iesus went vnto y=e= Mount of Oliues : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.986

2 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.987

And earely in the morning hee came againe into the Temple ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.988

and all the people came vnto him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.989

and he sate downe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.990

and taught them . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.991

3 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.992

And the Scribes and Pharisees brought vnto him a woman taken in adultery
, AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.993

and when they had set her in the mids , 4 They say vnto him , Master ,
this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.994

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.995

Now Moses in the Law commanded vs , that such should be stoned :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.996

but what sayest thou ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.997

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.998

This they said , tempting him , that they might haue to accuse him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.999

But Iesus stouped downe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1000

and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1001

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1002

So when they continued asking him , hee lift vp himselfe ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1003

and saide vnto them , Hee that is without sinne among you , let him
first cast a stone at her . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1004

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1005

And againe , hee stouped downe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1006

and wrote on the ground . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1007

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1008

And they which heard it , being conuicted by their owne conscience ,
went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , euen vnto the last :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1009

and Iesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1010

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1011

When Iesus had lift vp himselfe , and saw none but the woman , hee said
vnto her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1012

Hath no man condemned thee ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1013

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1014

She saide , No man , Lord . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1015

And Iesus saide vnto her , Neither doe I condemne thee :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1016

Goe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1017

and sinne no more . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1018

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1019

Then spake Iesus againe vnto them , saying , I am the light of the world
: AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1020

he that followeth mee , shall not walke in the darkenesse ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1021

but shall haue the light of life . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1022

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1023

The Pharisees therefore said vnto him , Thou bearest record of thy selfe
, AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1024

thy record is not true . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1025

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1026

Iesus answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1027

and said vnto them , Though I beare record of my selfe , yet my record
is true : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1028

for I know whence I came , and whither I goe :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1029

but ye can@ @not tell whence I come , and whither I goe .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1030

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1031

Yee iudge after the flesh , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1032

I iudge no man . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1033

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1034

And yet if I iudge , my iudgement is true : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1035

for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1036

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1037

It is also written in your Law , that the testimonie of two men is true
. AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1038

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1039

I am one that beare witnesse of my selfe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1040

and the Father that sent mee , beareth witnesse of me .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1041

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1042

Then said they vnto him , Where is thy Father ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1043

Iesus answered , Ye neither know me , nor my Father :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1044

if ye had knowen mee , yee should haue knowen my Father also .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,1J.1045

<P_8,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1047

These words spake Iesus in the treasury , as hee taught in the Temple :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1048

and no man layd hands on him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1049

for his houre was not yet come . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1050

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1051

Then saide Iesus againe vnto them , I goe my way ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1052

and ye shall seeke me , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1053

& shall die in your sinnes : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1054

Whither I goe , ye can@ @not come . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1055

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1056

Then said the Iewes , Will hee kill himselfe ? because he saith ,
Whither I goe , ye can@ @not come . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1057

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1058

And hee said vnto them , Yee are from beneath ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1059

I am from aboue : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1060

Yee are of this world , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1061

I am not of this world . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1062

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1063

I said therefore vnto you , that ye shall die in your sinnes .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1064

For if yee beleeue not that I am hee , yee shall die in your sinnes .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1065

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1066

Then said they vnto him , Who art thou ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1067

And Iesus saith vnto them , Euen the same that I saide vnto you from the
beginning . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1068

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1069

I haue many things to say , and to iudge of you :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1070

But hee that sent mee is true , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1071

and I speake to the world , those things which I haue heard of him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1072

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1073

They vnderstood not that hee spake to them of the Father .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1074

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1075

Then saide Iesus vnto them , When yee haue lift vp the Sonne of man ,
then shall ye know that I am he , and that I doe nothing of my selfe :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1076

but as my Father hath taught mee , I speake these things .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1077

29 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1078

And he that sent me , is with me : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1079

the Father hath not left mee alone : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1080

for I doe alwayes those things that please him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1081

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1082

As hee spake those words , many beleeued on him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1083

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1084

Then said Iesus to those Iewes which beleeued on him , If ye continue in
my word , then are yee my disciples indeed .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1085

32 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1086

And ye shall know the Trueth , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1087

and the Trueth shall make you free . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1088

33 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1089

They answered him , We be Abraham seed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1090

and were neuer in bondage to any man : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1091

how sayest thou , Yee shall be made free ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1092

34 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1093

Iesus answered them , Verily , verily I say vnto you , Whosoeuer
committeth sinne , is the seruant of sinne .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1094

35 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1095

And the seruant abideth not in the house for euer :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1096

but the Sonne abideth euer . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1097

36 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1098

If the Sonne therfore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1099

37 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1100

I know that yee are Abrahams seed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1101

but ye seeke to kill mee , because my word hath no place in you .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1102

38 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1103

I speake that which I haue seene with my Father :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1104

and ye do that which ye haue seene with your father .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1105

39 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1106

They answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1107

and said vnto him , Abraham is our father .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1108

Iesus sayth vnto them , If yee were Abrahams children , ye would doe the
works of Abraham . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,20J.1109

<P_8,40J>

40 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1111

But now yee seeke to kill me , a man that hath tolde you the trueth ,
which I haue heard of God : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1112

this did not Abraham . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1113

41 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1114

Ye doe the deeds of your father . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1115

Then said they to him , We be not borne of fornication ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1116

wee haue one Father , euen God . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1117

42 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1118

Iesus said vnto them , If God were your Father , yee would loue me ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1119

for I proceeded foorth , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1120

and came from God : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1121

neither came I of my selfe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1122

but he sent me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1123

43 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1124

Why doe yee not vnderstand my speech ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1125

euen because yee can@ @not heare my word . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1126

44 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1127

Ye are of your father the deuill , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1128

and the lusts of your father ye will doe : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1129

he was a murtherer from the beginning , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1130

and abode not in the trueth , because there is no truth in him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1131

When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his owne :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1132

for he is a liar , and the father of it . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1133

45 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1134

And because I tell you the truth , ye beleeue me not .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1135

46 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1136

Which of you conuinceth mee of sinne ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1137

And if I say the trueth , why doe ye not beleeue me ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1138

47 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1139

He that is of God , heareth Gods words : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1140

ye therefore heare them not , because ye are not of God .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1141

48 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1142

Then answered the Iewes , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1143

and said vnto him , Say wee not well that thou art a Samaritane , & hast
a deuill ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1144

49 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1145

Iesus answered , I haue not a deuill : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1146

but I honour my Father , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1147

and ye doe dishonour me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1148

50 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1149

And I seeke not mine owne glory , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1150

there is one that seeketh & iudgeth . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1151

51 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1152

Verely , verely I say vnto you , If a man keepe my saying , hee shall
neuer see death . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1153

52 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1154

Then said the Iewes vnto him , Now we know that thou hast a deuill .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1155

Abraham is dead , and the Prophets : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1156

and thou sayest , If a man keepe my saying , he shall neuer taste of
death . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1157

53 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1158

Art thou greater then our father Abraham , which is dead ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1159

and the Prophets are dead : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1160

whom makest thou thy selfe ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1161

54 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1162

Iesus answered , If I honour my selfe , my honour is nothing :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1163

it is my Father that honoureth me , of whom ye say , that he is your God
: AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1164

55 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1165

Yet ye haue not knowen him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1166

but I know him : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1167

and if I should say , I know him not , I shal@ @be a lyar like vnto you
: AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1168

but I know him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1169

and keepe his saying . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1170

56 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1171

Your father Abraham reioyced to see my day :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1172

and he saw it , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1173

& was glad . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1174

57 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1175

Then said the Iewes vnto him , Thou art not yet fiftie yeeres olde ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1176

and hast thou seene Abraham ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1177

58 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1178

Iesus said vnto them , Verely , verely I say vnto you , Before Abraham
was , I am . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1179

59 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1180

Then tooke they vp stones to cast at him : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,8,40J.1181

And as Iesus passed by , he saw a man which was blinde from his birth .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1190

2 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1191

And his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sinne , this man
, or his parents , that he was borne blinde ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1192

3 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1193

Iesus answered , Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents , but
that the workes of God should be made manifest in him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1194

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1195

I must worke the workes of him that sent me , while it is day :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1196

the night commeth when no man can worke . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1197

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1198

As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1199

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1200

When he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1201

and made clay of the spettle , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1202

and he anointed the eyes of the blinde man with the clay .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1203

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1204

And said vnto him , Goe , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1205

wash in the poole of Siloam <paren> which is by interpretation , Sent .
<$$paren> AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1206

He went his way therfore , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1207

and washed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1208

and came seeing . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1209

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1210

The neighbours therefore , and they which before had seene him , that he
was blinde , said , Is not this he that sate and begged ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1211

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1212

Some said , This is hee : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1213

others said , Hee is like him : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1214

but hee sayd , I am hee . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1215

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1216

Therefore said they vnto him , How were thine eyes opened ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1217

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1218

He answered AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1219

and said , A man that is called Iesus , made clay ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1220

and anointed mine eyes , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1221

and said vnto me , Goe to the poole of Siloam ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1222

and wash : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1223

and I went AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1224

and washed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1225

and I receiued sight . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1226

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1227

Then said they vnto him , Where is he ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1228

He said , I know not . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1229

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1230

They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1231

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1232

And it was the Sabbath day when Iesus made the clay , and opened his
eyes . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1233

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1234

Then againe the Pharisees also asked him how he had receiued his sight .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1235

He said vnto them , Hee put clay vpon mine eyes ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1236

and I washed , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1237

and doe see . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1238

16 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1239

Therefore said some of the Pharisees , This man is not of God , because
hee keepeth not the Sabbath day . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1240

Others said , How can a man that is a sinner , doe such miracles ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1241

and there was a diuision among them . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1242

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1243

They say vnto the blind man againe , What sayest thou of him , that he
hath opened thine eyes ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1244

He said , Hee is a Prophet . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1245

18 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1246

But the Iewes did not beleeue concerning him , that hee had bin blind ,
and receiued his sight , vntill they called the parents of him that had
receiued his sight . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1247

19 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1248

And they asked them , saying , Is this your sonne , who ye say was borne
blind ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1249

how then doth he now see ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,1J.1250

<P_9,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1252

His parents answered them , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1253

and said , We know that this is our sonne , and that he was borne blind
: AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1254

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1255

But by what meanes he now seeth , we know not ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1256

or who hath opened his eyes we know not : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1257

hee is of age , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1258

aske him , he shall speake for himselfe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1259

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1260

These words spake his parents , because they feared the Iewes :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1261

for the Iewes had agreed already , that if any man did confesse that he
was Christ , he should be put out of the Synagogue .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1262

23 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1263

Therefore said his parents , He is of age , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1264

aske him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1265

24 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1266

Then againe called they the man that was blind ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1267

and said vnto him , Giue God the praise , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1268

we know that this man is a sinner . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1269

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1270

He answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1271

and said , Whether he be a sinner or no , I know not :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1272

One thing I know , that whereas I was blind , now I see .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1273

26 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1274

Then saide they to him againe , What did he to thee ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1275

How opened hee thine eyes ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1276

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1277

He answered them , I haue told you already ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1278

and ye did not heare : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1279

wherfore would you heare it againe ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1280

Will ye also be his disciples ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1281

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1282

Then they reuiled him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1283

and said , Thou art his disciple , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1284

but we are Moses disciples . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1285

29 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1286

Wee know that God spake vnto Moses : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1287

as for this fellow , we knowe not from whence he is .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1288

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1289

The man answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1290

and said vnto them , Why herein is a marueilous thing , that ye know not
from whence he is , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1291

and yet he hath opened mine eyes . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1292

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1293

Now we know that God heareth not sinners : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1294

but if any man bee a worshipper of God , and doth his will , him he
heareth . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1295

32 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1296

Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of
one that was borne blinde : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1297

33 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1298

If this man were not of God , he could doe nothing .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1299

34 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1300

They answered , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1301

and saide vnto him , Thou wast altogether borne in sinnes ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1302

and doest thou teach vs ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1303

And they cast him out . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1304

35 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1305

Iesus heard that they had cast him out ; AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1306

and when hee had found him , he said vnto him , Doest thou beleeue on
the Sonne of God ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1307

36 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1308

He answered AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1309

and said , Who is he , Lord , that I might beleeue on him ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1310

37 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1311

And Iesus said vnto him , Thou hast both seene him ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1312

and it is he that talketh with thee . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1313

38 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1314

And he said , Lord , I beleeue : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1315

and he worshipped him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1316

39 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1317

And Iesus said , For iudgement I am come into this world , that they
which see not , might see , and that they which see , might be made
blind . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,20J.1318

<P_9,40J>

40 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,40J.1320

And some of the Pharisees which were with him , heard these words ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,40J.1321

and saide vnto him , Are wee blinde also ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,40J.1322

41 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,40J.1323

Iesus saide vnto them , If yee were blind , ye should haue no sinne :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,40J.1324

but now ye say , We see , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,9,40J.1325

This parable spake Iesus vnto them : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,1J.1349

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,1J.1350

Then the Iewes tooke vp stones againe to stone him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,20J.1433

32 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,20J.1434

Iesus answered them , Many good workes haue I shewed you from my Father
: AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,20J.1435

for which of those workes doe ye stone me ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,20J.1436

33 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,20J.1437

The Iewes answered him , saying , For a good worke wee stone thee not ,
but for blasphemy , and because that thou , being a man , makest thy
selfe God . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,20J.1438

34 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,20J.1439

Iesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , I said , ye are
gods ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,20J.1440

35 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,20J.1441

If hee called them gods , vnto whom the word of God came , and the

I am the Sonne of God ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,10,20J.1442

Now a certaine man was sicke , named Lazarus of Bethanie , the towne of
Mary , and her sister Martha . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1464

<$$paren> AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1466

Therefore his sister sent vnto him , saying , Lord , behold , hee whom
thou louest , is sicke . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1468

4 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1469

When Iesus heard that , hee said , This sicknesse is not vnto death ,
but for the glory of God , that the Sonne of God might be glorified
thereby . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1470

5 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1471

Now Iesus loued Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1472

6 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1473

When he had heard therefore that he was sicke , he abode two dayes still
in the same place where he was . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1474

7 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1475

Then after that , saith hee to his disciples , Let vs go into Iudea
againe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1476

8 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1477

His disciples say vnto him , Master , the Iewes of late sought to stone

and goest thou thither againe ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1479

9 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1480

Iesus answered , Are there not twelue houres in the day ?
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1481

If any man walke in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the
light of this world . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1482

10 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1483

But if a man walke in the night , hee stumbleth , because there is no
light in him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1484

11 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1485

These things said hee , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1486

and after that , hee saith vnto them , Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1487

but I goe , that I may awake him out of sleepe .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1488

12 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1489

Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleepe , he shall doe well .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1490

13 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1491

Howbeit Iesus spake of his death : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1492

but they thought that hee had spoken of taking of rest in sleepe .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1493

14 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1494

Then saide Iesus vnto them plainly , Lazarus is dead :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1495

15 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1496

Then said Thomas , which is called Didymus , vnto his fellow disciples ,
Let vs also goe , that we may die with him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1500

17 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,1J.1501

<P_11,20J>

20 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1508

Then Martha , as soone as shee heard that Iesus was comming , went

and met him : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1510

but Mary sate still in the house . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1511

21 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1512

Then saide Martha vnto Iesus , Lord , if thou hadst bene here , my
brother had not died . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1513

22 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1514

resurrection at the last day . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1519

25 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1520

Iesus said vnto her , I am the resurrection , and the life :

Beleeuest thou this ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1525

27 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1526

She saith vnto him , Yea Lord , I beleeue that thou art the Christ the

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1527

28 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1528

And when shee had so said , shee went her way ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1529

and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1530

As@ @sone as she heard that , she arose quickely ,

and came vnto him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1534

30 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1535

Now Iesus was not yet come into the towne ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1536

but was in that place where Martha met him .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1537

31 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1538

The Iewes then which were with her in the house , and comforted her ,

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1539

brother had not dyed . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1541

When Iesus therefore sawe her weeping , and the Iewes also weeping which

and was troubled , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1544

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1551

37 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1552

And some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1553

38 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1554

Iesus therefore againe groning in himselfe , commeth to the graue .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1555

It was a caue , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1556

and a stone lay vpon it . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1557

39 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1558

Iesus said , Take yee away the stone . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,20J.1559

Martha , the sister of him that was dead , sayth vnto him , Lord , by

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1564

41 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1565

Then they tooke away the stone from the place where the dead was laid .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1566

And Iesus lift vp his eyes , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1567

And I knewe that thou hearest me alwayes : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1570

beleeue that thou hast sent me . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1571

and his face was bound about with a napkin .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1576

Iesus saith vnto them , Loose him , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1577

and let him goe . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1578

45 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1579

Then many of the Iewes which came to Mary , and had seene the things
which Iesus did , beleeued on him . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1580

46 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1581

But some of them went their wayes to the Pharises ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1582

and tolde them what things Iesus had done .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1583

47 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1584

Then gathered y=e= chiefe Priests and the Pharises a councell ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1585

and said , What doe wee ? AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1586

for this man doeth many miracles . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1587

If we let him thus alone , all men will beleeue on him ,
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1589

and the Romanes shall come , and take away both our place and nation .
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1590

49 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1591

And one of them named Caiaphas , being the high Priest that same yeere ,
said vnto them , Ye know nothing at all , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1592

50 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1593

Nor consider that it is expedient for vs , that one man should die for

AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1594

51 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1595

And this spake he not of himselfe : AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1596

but being high Priest that yeere , he prophecied that Iesus should die
for that nation : 52 And not for that nation only , but that also hee
should gather together in one , the children of God that were scattered
abroad . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1597

53 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1598

Then from that day foorth , they tooke counsell together for to put him
to death . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1599

54 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1600

Iesus therefore walked no more openly among the Iewes :
AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1601

but went thence vnto a countrey neere to the wildernesse , into a city
called Ephraim , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1602

and there continued with his disciples . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1603

And the Iewes Passeouer was nigh at hand , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1605

to purifie themselues . AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1606

56 AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1607

Then sought they for Iesus , AUTHNEW-1611-E2-H,11,40J.1608

and spake among themselues , as they stood in the Temple , What thinke
