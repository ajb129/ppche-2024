<P_4,72.C2>

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Now , my Lord , we shall go to our
Evidence to prove , that all this is absolutely false :
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.3

For <font> Ireland <$$font> went out of Town into <font> Staffordshire
<$$font> , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.4

and did not return till after the 9th of <font> September <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.5

And for this , we call <font> Anne Ireland <$$font> . <font> Who was
sworn . <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.6

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> Mrs. <font> Ireland <$$font> , pray
where did you take your leave of your Brother Mr. <font> Ireland
<$$font> , who was executed in <font> Summer <$$font> 1678 , and when ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.7

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> I took my leave of him the
beginning of <font> August <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.8

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> What day in <font> August <$$font> , do
you remember ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.9

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> The 3d of <font> August <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.10

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> Where was it ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.11

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> In my own Lodging .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.12

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Where was your Lodging ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.13

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> In <font> Russel-street ,
Covent-Garden <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.14

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Now tell us again the time when it was ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.15

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> It was on <font> Saturday <$$font>
Morning , as I remember , the 3d of <font> August <$$font> , the <font>
Saturday <$$font> after St. <font> Ignatius's <$$font> Day .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.16

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How come you remember so particularly , that
it was then ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,72.C2.17

<P_4,73.C1>

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> Because upon St. <font> Ignatius's
<$$font> Day , we were invited to Mr. <font> Gifford's <$$font> at
<font> Hammersmith <$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.19

my Brother , my Mother , and I , were invited to stay all Night :
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.20

But my Brother refused to stay , because - OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.21

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Which Brother ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.22

What was his Name ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.23

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . William Ireland . <$$font>
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.24

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did they stay there ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.25

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> No , my Lord , my Brother came home
on foot , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.26

but we staid all Night . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.27

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Here is an Almanack of that Year :
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.28

And the 3d of <font> August <$$font> was on a <font> Saturday <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.29

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> He said he could not stay , because
he was to go into the Country upon <font> Saturday <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.30

I ask'd him , <font> Why he would set out on <$$font> Saturday ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.31

And says he , <font> I@ @'ll go to <$$font> Standen ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.32

<font> there I shall meet with my Lord <$$font> Aston , <font> and his
Family ; and have an Opportunity to go with him into <$$font>
Staffordshire . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.33

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> She says , he went out of Town on <font>
Saturday <$$font> after St. <font> Ignatius's <$$font> Day ; which was
<font> Saturday <$$font> the 3d of <font> August <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.34

But there being a Discourse between her and her Brother , why he should
make choice of a <font> Saturday <$$font> ; which she thought , it seems
, was an inconvenient Day to take a Journey on :
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.35

And upon that , her Brother made answer again , That that Night he would
only go to <font> Standen <$$font> , to my Lord <font> Aston@ @'s
<$$font> House , where he should meet with Company to go along with him
into <font> Staffordshire <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.36

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> What Day of the Week was St. <font>
Ignatius's <$$font> Day ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.37

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> St. <font> Ignatius's <$$font> Day
was on a <font> Wednesday <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.38

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What day of the Month is St. <font>
Ignatius's <$$font> Day ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.39

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> It is either the last Day of <font>
July <$$font> , or the 1st of <font> August <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.40

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Look on your Almanack , if you have any one
of that Year , Mr. Attorney . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.41

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> We have no such Saint in our Almanack .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.42

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> It was , as near as I can remember
, the 3d of <font> August <$$font> , that he went out of Town .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.43

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> The 3d of <font> August <$$font> , at
that time , was on a <font> Saturday <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.44

Lord <font> Petre . <$$font> St. <font> Ignatius's <$$font> Day is
always the last Day of <font> July <$$font> , my Lord .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.45

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> In this Almanack , another Saint has
justled him out ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.46

and that is Bishop <font> German <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.47

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And in my Almanack , a third has justled
them both out : OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.48

but my Lord <font> Petre <$$font> says , it is always the last of <font>
July <$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.49

and that was on a <font> Wednesday <$$font> that Year .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.50

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> I remember it was on a <font>
Wednesday <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.51

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And you are sure he went out of Town the
<font> Saturday <$$font> after ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.52

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> Yes , I am sure he went out of Town
then ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.53

for I asked him , why he would go on a <font> Saturday <$$font> ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.54

And he told me , he would go but to <font> Standen <$$font> that Night .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.55

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> And that does hold , according to the
Computation , to be the 3d of <font> August <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.56

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , she is not positive in this , that he
went out of Town the 3d of <font> August <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.57

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Yes , but she is ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.58

for she says , that she was the <font> Wednesday <$$font> before <paren>
which was St. <font> Ignatius's <$$font> Day <$$paren> with him a
little way out of Town . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.59

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And that it was <font> Saturday <$$font>
after he went out of Town ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C1.60

and she gives the Reason , that she entered into a Discourse with him ,
why he would go <P_4,73.C2> on <font> Saturday <$$font> ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.61

And he made that Answer which you hear . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.62

Mr. Just. <font> Withins . <$$font> Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> knows
what Day St. <font> Ignatius's <$$font> Day is upon , I presume .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.63

<font> Oates . <$$font> It is the last Day of <font> July <$$font> , I
think . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.64

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> In our Protestant Almanacks , it seems
, we give another Bishop place . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.65

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Mrs. <font> Ireland <$$font> , when did
you see him again ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.66

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> Just a Fortnight before <font>
Michaelmas <$$font> , and not before . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.67

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You were his near Relation , I suppose ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.68

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> Yes , my Lord , I was his Sister .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.69

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pray , when he came to Town again , where
did he lodge ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.70

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> He used to lodge at the same place
where we did always ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.71

and in the mean time , while he was absent , my Mother lent one Mrs.
<font> Eagleston <$$font> his Lodging . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.72

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Is that Person , you lent his Chamber to in
his Absence , here ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.73

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> No , my Lord .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.74

; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.76

her Maid fell sick , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.77

and so she came down a pair of Stairs lower into his Lodging .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.78

It was in a short time after he went out of Town , my Lord , as I
remember . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.79

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> When did he come to Town again , do you say
? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.80

Mrs. <font> A. Ireland . <$$font> He came to Town again a Fortnight
before <font> Michaelmas <$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.81

that <font> Michaelmas-day <$$font> fell on - OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.82

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Have you any Questions to ask her , Mr.
<font> Oates <$$font> ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,73.C2.83

Mrs. <font> Duddle . <$$font> I am sure he staid but one Night .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.138

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But what say you to that , Mr. Attorney ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.139

this Witness contradicts the other . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.140

Mr. Just. <font> Withins . <$$font> Ay , plainly .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.141

OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.144

and never came again till a Fortnight before <font> Michaelmas <$$font>
. OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.145

Mrs. <font> Duddle . <$$font> I do not know .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.149

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But just now , you swore he staid out all
Night ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.150

Mrs. <font> Duddle . <$$font> No , my Lord .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.151

Saturday <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.155

And Mr. <font> Jennison <$$font> came to ask for him three Weeks after
; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.156

and there was a Person of Quality with him in the Coach ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.157

I think it was Sir <font> Miles Wharton . <$$font>
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.158

And he asking for him , they gave him an account , that they had not
heard from him since he went ; which was then three Weeks after he was
gone . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C1.159

And I remember well , he did <P_4,74.C2> not come to Town again till a
Fortnight before <font> Michaelmas <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.160

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How can you tell that ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.161

Mrs. <font> Duddle . <$$font> My Lord , I can tell it very well :
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.162

For I was almost every Night in the Room where he used to lie ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.163

and there lay a Gentlewoman there , that I knew .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.164

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What was her Name ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.165

Mrs. <font> Duddle . <$$font> Mrs. <font> Eagleston <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.166

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How come she to lie there ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.167

Mrs. <font> Duddle . <$$font> Her Maid fell sick ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.168

and she chang'd her own Chamber , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.169

and lay there all the time he was out of Town .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.170

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , is this good Evidence ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.171

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay , why not ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.172

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , I think she contradicts the other
Witness : OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.173

For she says he lay out two Nights . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.174

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No , there you are mistaken too .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.175

But I tell you what I did observe before . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.176

Mrs. <font> Anne Ireland <$$font> swore , that they did stay all night
; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.177

but Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> refused to stay there ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.178

but would go home , because he was to go his Journey on <font> Saturday
<$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.179

Then this Woman comes ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.180

and she said at first , that he went out of Town on the <font> Wednesday
<$$font> , and staid out all Night , and lay at home but two Nights ,
and then went away . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.181

But now when I put her in mind to take care what she said , she swears ,
she is sure the Sister lay out , but she is not sure of <font> Ireland's
<$$font> lying out . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.182

But she is positive he went away on <font> Saturday <$$font> the 3d of
<font> August <$$font> , and return'd not till a Fortnight before <font>
Michaelmas <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.183

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , I humbly conceive , she having once
sworn false - OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.184

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay , but she immediately recollected her
self . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.185

<font> Oates . <$$font> By what Token does she remember it to be the 3d
of <font> August <$$font> ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.186

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> She said before , it was the <font> Saturday
<$$font> after St. <font> Ignatius's <$$font> Day , which was on a
<font> Wednesday <$$font> , the last Day of <font> July <$$font> ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.187

and he went then out of Town . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.188

She call'd it by the Name of <font> Recreation <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.189

<font> Oates . <$$font> Was it the <font> Saturday <$$font> after St.
<font> Ignatius's <$$font> Day ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.190

Mrs. <font> Duddle . <$$font> Yes , it was :
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.191

And I had not remember'd it , but that it was upon that Holiday .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.192

<font> Oates . <$$font> This is a <font> Roman <$$font> Catholick , I
suppose , my Lord . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.193

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I can@ @not tell .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.194

What Religion are you of ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.195

Mrs. <font> Duddle . <$$font> I am a <font> Roman <$$font> Catholick ,
my Lord . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.196

Mr. <font> Jennison <$$font> knows what I say to be true .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.197

<font> Oates . <$$font> Were you a Witness in any of the Trials at the
<font> Old-Bailey <$$font> ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.198

Mrs. <font> Duddle . <$$font> I was in the Court ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.199

but was not call'd . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.200

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> What say you , Mrs. <font> Quino
<$$font> ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.201

When did Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> go out of Town ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.202

Mrs. <font> Quino . <$$font> I must say the same ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.203

it was the 3d Day of <font> August <$$font> , on a <font> Saturday
<$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.204

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How do you know that it was on a <font>
Saturday <$$font> the 3d of <font> August <$$font> ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.205

Mrs. <font> Quino . <$$font> By the same Reason that she speaks .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.206

I mark'd that other Day he went out of Town ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.207

and he came again , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.208

and his Mother staid there that Night : OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.209

And he went on <font> Saturday <$$font> Morning out of Town .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.210

I know it very well ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.211

for my Husband was his Taylor , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.212

and he had somewhat to alter in his Clothes ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.213

and I brought it immediately after it was done .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.214

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Are you sure he went out of Town that Day ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.215

Mrs. <font> Quino . <$$font> He went out of the House ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.216

and as I take it , went out of Town ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,74.C2.217

<P_4,75.C1>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did he say , he was to go out of Town ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.219

Mrs. <font> Quino . <$$font> He had his Boots on ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.220

and took Horse at the <font> Bull-Inn <$$font> in <font> Drury-lane
<$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.221

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How do you know it ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.222

Mrs. <font> Quino . <$$font> Because his Servant that was there has
testified it . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.223

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Now swear my Lord <font> Aston <$$font>
. OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.224

<font> Which was done . <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.225

We@ @'ll bring <font> Ireland <$$font> now upon the 3d of <font> August
<$$font> at Night , to my Lord <font> Aston@ @'s <$$font> House at
<font> Standen <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.226

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> Pray will your Lordship give my Lord
and the Jury an account , when Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> came to your
House , and how far he travelled with you afterwards ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.227

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> My Lord , being in Town , I was spoke to ,
and desired , that Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> might have the
Opportunity of going in my Company down into <font> Staffordshire
<$$font> ; which I consented to . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.228

I went out of Town , as I remember , the latter end of <font> July
<$$font> 1678 , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.229

and this same Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> came to me at my house in
<font> Hertfordshire <$$font> at <font> Standen <$$font> , upon the 3d
of <font> August <$$font> at Night . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.230

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Day of the Week was that , my Lord ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.231

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> As I remember , it was <font> Saturday
<$$font> , and in the Evening . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.232

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How long did he stay with your Lordship ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.233

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> My Lord , I staid till <font> Monday
<$$font> at <font> Standen <$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.234

and upon <font> Monday <$$font> he went in my Company to <font> St.
Albans <$$font> , which was the 5th of <font> August <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.235

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Whither then did you go , my Lord ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.236

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> There I met with my Brother and Sister
<font> Southcoat <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.237

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Sir <font> John Southcoat <$$font> you mean
, my Lord . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.238

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> Yes , my Lord .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.239

And thence , in four Days , we went to my House at <font> Tixhall
<$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.240

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> travel with
you all the way ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.241

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> I can@ @not charge my Memory , my Lord ,
that he did , so as particularly to swear it :
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.242

But there he came into my Company sometimes at <font> Tixhall <$$font> ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.243

but I can@ @not tell the particular Days : OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.244

Nor could I speak positively to those things that I have spoke to now ,
but that I find in my Note-Book , that at that time he did come to my
House at <font> Standen <$$font> , and did go with me to <font> St.
Albans <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.245

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Pray , my Lord , did he go that Journey
to <font> Tixhall <$$font> along with you ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.246

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> I can@ @not say positively that , Mr.
<font> Attorney <$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.247

but I have a general Notion that he did . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.248

Nor could I testify this so positively , I say , but by Notes that I
have of things at that time : Where I have only writ down these things
concerning Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> , that he came the 3d of <font>
August <$$font> to my House at <font> Standen <$$font> : That on <font>
Monday <$$font> we went together to <font> St. Albans <$$font> ; and
there met us Sir <font> John Southcoat <$$font> , and my Sister his Wife
; and thence I went to <font> Tixhall <$$font> ; and there I arriv'd the
8th of <font> August <$$font> , which was <font> Thursday <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.249

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> My Lord , I ask you this Question ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.250

you say , you have a general Apprehension , that he did go with you to
<font> Tixhall <$$font> : OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.251

Pray , did he come with you to <font> Standen <$$font> for that purpose
, to go with you to <font> Tixhall <$$font> ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.252

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> I had no business with him at all ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.253

but he desired the opportunity to go down in my Company into <font>
Staffordshire <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.254

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pray , my Lord , do you remember you saw him
within four or five Days after at <font> Tixhall <$$font> ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C1.255

<P_4,75.C2>

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> To name particular Days , I can@ @not ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.257

but that I saw him several Days at <font> Tixhall <$$font> , I am sure .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.258

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , you say that Sir <font> John
Southcoat <$$font> went with you to <font> Tixhall <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.259

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> Yes , he did so .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.260

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , I would ask this Nobleman , whether
he was at the Trial of the five Jesuits ? or the Trial of <font>
Ireland <$$font> ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.261

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> No , my Lord , I was not .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.262

<font> Oates . <$$font> Then I would ask my Lord , if he saw Mr.
<font> Ireland <$$font> executed ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.263

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> No , I did not .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.264

<font> Oates . <$$font> Then I would ask him this Question ; whether
the <font> Ireland <$$font> that was executed be the same <font> Ireland
<$$font> he speaks of ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.265

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> Amongst those that knew him well , I have
been told it was the same . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.266

<font> Oates . <$$font> That is but Hear-say , my Lord ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.267

he does not speak of his own Knowledge . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.268

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> For that matter , I suppose , you@ @'ll
produce some other <font> Ireland <$$font> , Mr. <font> Oates <$$font>
, if it was not the same . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.269

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Was it this Mrs. <font> Ireland's
<$$font> Brother , that was here a Witness now ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.270

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> He was so reputed , and so looked upon .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.271

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That is all one .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.272

If any body should ask me , if you were the same Mr. <font> Oates
<$$font> that was at <font> St. Omers <$$font> ; I should say , I heard
so ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.273

and it would be very good Evidence , unless some one else were produc'd
. OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.274

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , I submit ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.275

I will be directed by the Court in any thing that is fair , and not
injurious to my Defence . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.276

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> We will not direct you in any thing that@
@'s foul , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.277

but pray keep to those Questions that are pertinent .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.278

<font> Oates . <$$font> Are you sure <font> Ireland <$$font> went the
whole Journey with you , my Lord ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.279

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> I did answer that ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.280

I have but a general Notion of it , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.281

he came to me for that purpose . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.282

<font> Oates . <$$font> Then my Lord is not positive he went with him
into <font> Staffordshire <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.283

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No he is not ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.284

but I would ask you this Question . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.285

My Lord <font> Aston <$$font> , do you believe he went with you to
<font> Tixhall <$$font> ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.286

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> I make no doubt about it ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.287

I would pawn all I have in the World upon it ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.288

only I can@ @not swear it , because I have it not in my Notes , as I
have those two other Days . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.289

Mr. Just. <font> Withins . <$$font> Do you like him the worse ,
because he is cautious , Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.290

<font> Oates . <$$font> No , Sir , I do not .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.291

But pray , my Lord , ask him , because it is a Question here about a
point of Time ; whether he remembers , that within eight or ten Days ,
he saw <font> Ireland <$$font> at <font> Tixhall <$$font> ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.292

Lord <font> Aston . <$$font> I can@ @not say any thing as to that .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.293

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Swear Sir <font> Edward Southcoat
<$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.294

<font> Which was done . <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.295

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I thought you had called him Sir <font> John
Southcoat <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.296

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Sir <font> John <$$font> is sick ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.297

and can@ @not be here . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.298

<font> Oates . <$$font> I suppose my Lord <font> Aston <$$font> is a
<font> Roman <$$font> Catholick ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.299

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay , that all the World knows very well ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.300

but I tell you what , Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.301

I observe , he is not so easy in giving his Oath ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.302

nay , he is wonderful cautious in swearing : OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.303

I speak it for his Commendation , not as his Fault ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.304

he is not very forward at swearing . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,75.C2.305

<P_4,82.C1>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You say , you did write to him upon the 2d
of <font> September <$$font> ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.307

Mrs. <font> Harwell . <$$font> Yes , I did so .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.308

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What was the occasion of your writing to him
at that time ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.309

Mrs. <font> Harwell . <$$font> One Madame <font> Dormer <$$font> was
then in those Parts , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.310

and he being gone a visiting his Friends at <font> Black-Ladies <$$font>
, I writ to him , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.311

and desired him to give her a Visit , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.312

for I knew she would be glad to see him . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.313

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> He came back to you the 4th of <font>
September <$$font> , you say ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.314

Mrs. <font> Harwell . <$$font> Yes , he did so , my Lord .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.315

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did he own upon the fourth of <font>
September <$$font> , that he had received your Letter ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.316

Mrs. <font> Harwell . <$$font> He said he had been at the Place , My
Lord , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.317

but I know not whether he had received my Letter or no ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.318

but I am sure he waited upon my Lady , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.319

for she told me so afterwards . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.320

<font> Oates . <$$font> I desire to know , whether this Gentlewoman was
at <font> Ireland's <$$font> Trial ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.321

Mrs. <font> Harwell . <$$font> No , my Lord ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.322

but I heard that upon the 17th of <font> December <$$font> following ,
Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> was tried at the <font> Old-Bailey <$$font>
for High-Treason . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.323

Upon the 19th , I was informed by the Post what was sworn against him ;
and particularly as to this time , which I knew to be false :
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.324

And upon my own Cost and Charges I sent an Express away to Town here to
a Friend that I knew , upon reading the Letter that was written to me ,
that Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> was falsely accused ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.325

and by that Express also I sent a Petition , humbly beseeching his late
Majesty , that we might bring in Witnesses to prove , that Mr. <font>
Ireland <$$font> was in <font> Staffordshire <$$font> , when Mr. <font>
Oates <$$font> swore he was in Town ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.326

and upon that the King staid the Execution about five Weeks .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.327

We did hope for a second Trial , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.328

but we could not obtain it ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.329

and he was executed . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.330

I did it at my own Cost and Charges : OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.331

For I thought it my Duty , if I could , to save his Life . knowing that
to be false which was sworn against him . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.332

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> She speaks gravely and soberly , upon my
Word . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.333

Mr. Just. <font> Withins . <$$font> So she does indeed .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.334

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> We have abundance of them , my Lord .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.335

Swear Mr. <font> William Rushton <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.336

<font> Which was done . <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.337

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> Tell my Lord what you know of Mr.
<font> Ireland's <$$font> being at Mrs. <font> Harwell's <$$font> in
<font> August <$$font> 1678 , at <font> Wolverhampton <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.338

Mr. <font> Rushton . <$$font> My Lord , in the Month of <font> August

and that I can@ @not be positive in . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.342

He went that day to <font> Litchfield <$$font> , which was upon the 23d
, as I take it , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.343

but I can@ @not be positive ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.344

but all the rest of the days I did see him there once , if not twice or
thrice a day . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.345

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Where did he lodge then ?
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.346

<font> Oates . <$$font> Were you at any of the Trials of <font> Ireland
<$$font> , or the five Jesuits , Sir ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.348

Mr. <font> Rushton . <$$font> No , I was never at one till now .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.349

<font> Oates . <$$font> Pray , my Lord , what Religion is this
Gentleman of , I desire to know ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C1.350

<P_4,82.C2>

Mr. <font> Rushton . <$$font> Not of your Worship's Religion , Dr.
<font> Oates <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.352

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But answer this Question .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.353

Mr. <font> Rushton . <$$font> I am a Catholick .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.354

<font> Oates . <$$font> A <font> Roman <$$font> Catholick he means , I
suppose . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.355

Mr. <font> Rushton . <$$font> Yes ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.356

I am a <font> Roman <$$font> Catholick , and a loyal Subject .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.357

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> Swear Mrs. <font> Katherine Winford
<$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.358

<font> Which was done . <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.359

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Mrs. <font> Winford <$$font> , pray did
you see Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> at Mrs. <font> Harwell's <$$font>
, in the Year 1678 ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.360

Mrs. <font> Winford . <$$font> Yes , I did , Sir .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.361

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Pray tell the Court what you do know of
that matter . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.362

Mrs. <font> Winford . <$$font> I did hear at <font> Wolverhampton
<$$font> , that Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> came to Town the 17th of
<font> August <$$font> , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.363

and I did see him there the 18th , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.364

and I did see him there the 19th , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.365

and I did see him the 20th ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.366

and I saw him there upon the 22d , 23d , 24th , and 25th ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.367

and that was the last time I saw him there .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.368

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> At Mrs. <font> Harwell's <$$font> was it
that you saw him ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.369

Mrs. <font> Winford . <$$font> Sometimes at Mrs. <font> Harwell's
<$$font> , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.370

and sometimes at my Father's House , who lived in that Town .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.371

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , I desire to know how she comes to
remember those Days so particularly ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.372

Mrs. <font> Winford . <$$font> I remember them , because St. <font>
Bartholomew's <$$font> Day was the 24th of <font> August <$$font> ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.373

and that was the <font> Saturday <$$font> after he came to Town ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.374

and the first day I saw him was the <font> Sunday <$$font> before ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.375

and so I reckon it to be on those days I saw him .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.376

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Have you any other Questions to ask her ,
Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.377

<font> Oates . <$$font> No , my Lord , I have not :
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.378

She was a Witness before at <font> Whitebread's <$$font> Trial ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.379

and was not believed there . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.380

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , make your Remarks by and by ,
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.381

and in the Afternoon he was in my own House .

House ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.390

I positively speak that , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.391

and <font> Wednesday <$$font> the 21st ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.392

but <font> Thursday <$$font> and <font> Friday <$$font> I can@ @not say
I did see him those two Days : OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.393

For he went upon one of them to <font> Litchfield <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.394

But upon <font> Saturday <$$font> and <font> Sunday <$$font> I am sure I
saw him , and two or three times some days .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,82.C2.395

<font> Oates . <$$font> Pray , Mr. <font> Stanley <$$font> , did you

Mr. <font> Stanley . <$$font> I am a <font> Roman <$$font> Catholick .

and I entertained him with those things that I had provided for to
entertain my Friends at the Funeral . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,83.C1.414

On <font> Monday <$$font> was a Wake , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,83.C1.415

and the young People went all to the Wake , OATES-1685-E3-H,4,83.C1.416

and left Madam <font> Harwell <$$font> alone ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,83.C1.417

and I entertained him with the same kind of Entertainment that I did the
Day before . OATES-1685-E3-H,4,83.C1.419

time it was ? OATES-1685-E3-H,4,85.C1.669

Sir <font> Thomas Whitegrave . <$$font> I saw Mr. <font> Ireland
<$$font> upon the 29th of <font> August <$$font> before the Popish Plot
; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,85.C2.671

it was upon a <font> Thursday <$$font> in the Afternoon upon <font>
Tixhall <$$font> Bowling-green ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,85.C2.672

and I discoursed with him : OATES-1685-E3-H,4,85.C2.673

he told me he was to go home that Night with Sir <font> James Simmons
<$$font> , and Mr. <font> Heveningham <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,85.C2.674

They told me afterwards he went on <font> Saturday <$$font> to <font>
Hildersham <$$font> , and went thence on <font> Monday <$$font>
following towards <font> Boscabel <$$font> : OATES-1685-E3-H,4,85.C2.675

some time after that , a Rumour came down that Mr. <font> Ireland
<$$font> was accused with others , of being in a Plot of the Papists ;
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,85.C2.676

and myself , and some others that were in Commission for the Peace in
that County , did reflect upon the time that <font> Ireland <$$font> was
in the Country ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,85.C2.677

and we were a little disturbed , because he had been at particular
Places among our Neighbours , whom we knew to be Catholicks .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,85.C2.678

I had no <font> Subpoena <$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-H,4,85.C2.684

and being a Justice of the Peace , I did not think fit to leave the
Country at that time without a <font> Subpoena <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-H,4,85.C2.685

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , I desire to know of this Gentleman ,
how long he had been acquainted with Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> .
