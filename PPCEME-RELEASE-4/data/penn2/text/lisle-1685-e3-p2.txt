<P_4.114>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No Doubt of that ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.3

but pri@ @thee tell me , whose Horse didst thou ride when thou wentest
first ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.4

<font> Dunne . <$$font> The Man's Horse that came to me to desire me to
go on the Message . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.5

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How came he to trust thee with his Horse ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.6

<font> Dunne . <$$font> The Lord knows , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.7

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou say'st right , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.8

the Lord only knows , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.9

for by the little I know of thee , I would not trust thee with Two-pence
: LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.10

Whose Horse didst thou ride the second time ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.11

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> My own , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.12

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And where didst thou put thy Horse when thou
camest to my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font> 's ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.13

<font> Dunne . <$$font> In the Stable , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.14

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Where did they put their Horses ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.15

<font> Dunne . <$$font> They left them without the Gate , I think , my
Lord ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.16

I did not see them take them in . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.17

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No , thou saidst it was so dark thou
could'st not see any thing : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.18

Pray were you with the two Men when they did alight ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.19

<font> Dunne . <$$font> We did all three come together .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.20

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What did you give <font> Fane <$$font> for
his Pains in shewing you the way ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.21

<font> Dunne . <$$font> He had nothing that I know of .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.22

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , you are the best-natur'd and
kindest-hearted People that ever I knew : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.23

Whereabouts do you live ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.24

<font> Dunne . <$$font> At <font> Warminster <$$font> , near my Lord
<font> Weymouth <$$font> 's . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.25

Mr. <font> Pollexfen . <$$font> Pray , Mr. <font> Dunne <$$font> ,
Will you answer me one Question : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.26

Was not there searching at that time up and down the Country for Rebels
that were fled from the Battle ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.27

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I did hear there was ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.28

some were taken . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.29

Mr. <font> Pollexfen . <$$font> But did you hear there was searching
at that time for other of the Rebels ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.30

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I did not hear of any near me ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.31

but there were in other Places . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.32

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then it being such a suspicious Time , when
that little Man with the black Beard came to thee , didst thou not ask
what that <font> Hicks <$$font> was ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.33

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , I did not .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.34

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And when Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font> and the
other Man that is call'd by the Name of Mr. <font> Nelthorp <$$font>
came to thy House , didst not thou ask their Names ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.35

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.36

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nor didst not thou ask upon what Occasion
they were to be conducted to my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font> 's ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.37

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.38

<font> Hicks <$$font> , the fat Man , told me they were in Debt .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.39

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not the Man that first came to you , and
employ'd you to go on this Message ; did not he know <font> Hicks ?
<$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.40

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> I can@ @not tell , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.41

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not he tell you , <font> Hicks <$$font>
desired you to go , and that he was in Debt , and therefore desired to
be concealed ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.42

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> Yes , my Lord , he did .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.43

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How came you to be so impudent then , as to
tell me such a Lye ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.44

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I beg your Pardon , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.45

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You beg my Pardon !
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.46

That is not because you told me a Lye , but because I have found you in
a Lye . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.47

Come , Sirrah , tell me the Truth ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.48

What did <font> Hicks <$$font> and <font> Nelthorp <$$font> with their
Horses , when they came to my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font> 's ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.49

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I can@ @not tell .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.50

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why you impudent Rascal , did not you tell
me just now that they left them at the Door ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.51

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I said I believ'd they might , but
can@ @not directly tell what they did with them ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.52

I know not but one or other might have them away ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.53

but I did not see it . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.54

Mr. <font> Pollexfen . <$$font> Pri@ @thee , Friend , tell the Truth ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.55

what did become of the Horses ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.56

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I can@ @not tell truly , my Lord ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.57

if any body had them away , I did not see them .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.58

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Where didst thou lie that Night ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.59

<font> Dunne . <$$font> In one of the Chambers .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.60

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who shewed thee the Way to thy Lodging ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.61

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> The Girl . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.62

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who else didst thou see in the House ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.63

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> I saw no body at all .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.64

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then who shewed thee the Way to the Stable ,
and help'd thee with Horse-meat ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.65

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> No body help'd me to Horse-meat .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.66

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why , thy Horse did not feed on thy Cake and
Cheese , did he ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.67

<font> Dunne . <$$font> There was Hay in the Rack , my Lord ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.68

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was the Stable-Door lock'd or open ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.69

<font> Dunne . <$$font> The Stable-Door was latch'd ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.70

and I pluck'd up the Latch . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.71

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How came you to know the Way to the Stable
then ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.72

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Because I had been there before , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.114.73

{COM:insert_helsinki_sample_1}

<P_4.115>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Perhaps her Questions might endanger the
coming out of all the Truth , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.76

and it may be she is well enough pleased to have him swear as He does ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.77

but it carries a very foul Face , upon my Word .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.78

<font> Then <$$font> Barter <font> was sworn <$$font> .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.79

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Is this <font> Barter ? <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.80

Mr. <font> Pollexfen . <$$font> Yes , my Lord ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.81

for his part we have his Examination before two Justices of Peace ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.82

but we hope he is an honest Fellow , and will tell the Truth .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.83

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That is all one whether you have his
Examination or not ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.84

I expect he should tell me the Truth , and the whole Truth here .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.85

Friend , you know your Soul is at pawn for the Truth of what you testify
to us ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.86

the other Fellow thou seest has been prevaricating with us all this
while , and swearing off and on , and scarce told one Word of Truth , I
know very well : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.87

Now I know as much of thee as I do of him , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.88

therefore look to thyself , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.89

and let the Truth , and nothing but the Truth , come out .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.90

<font> Barter . <$$font> May it please your Honour , my Lord , this Man
<font> Dunne <$$font> came to my House upon the <font> Saturday <$$font>
, LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.91

and spoke to me to ride along with him to <font> Moyle <$$font> -s
<font> Court <$$font> , where my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font> liv'd ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.92

and I having no other Business at that time , did go along with him :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.93

He had a Letter in his Pocket , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.94

and I saw him produce the Letter to my Lady's Bailiff , Mr. <font>
Carpenter <$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.95

but he would not meddle with it , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.96

so I suppose he went in with it to my Lady ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.97

and while I was in the Kitchen , my Lady came thither ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.98

And asked me , saith she , What Countryman art thou ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.99

Said I , Madam , I am a <font> Wiltshire <$$font> Man .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.100

Saith she , Do'st thou make Bricks ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.101

No , said I , Madam , I can@ @not , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.102

I can help in Husbandry-work . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.103

Saith she , If thou could'st make Bricks , I will give the ten Acres of
Ground in such a Place . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.104

I told her no , I could not : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.105

And then she goes to this Man <font> Dunne <$$font> ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.106

and there she was laughing with him , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.107

and look'd upon me ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.108

and afterwards when we were going along , I asked him what she laughed
at ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.109

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay , and now tell me what he said to thee
about it ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.110

<font> Barter . <$$font> He told me , my Lord , my Lady asked , whether
I knew any thing of the Concern ? And that he answered her , no ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.111

this the Fellow told me was that she laugh'd at .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.112

After this , I could not eat , nor drink , nor sleep for trouble of mind
, till I had discovered this to some Justice of the Peace ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.113

and I resolved at least to go to Colonel <font> Penruddock <$$font> ,
and consult him about it , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.114

so I went over LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.115

and told him of it . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.116

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What did you tell Colonel <font> Penruddock
<$$font> , let us hear ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.117

<font> Barter . <$$font> Where I had been the <font> Saturday <$$font>
before , and where I should meet them again upon <font> Salisbury-Plain
<$$font> upon the <font> Tuesday <$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.118

and we did agree he should come and take them there ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.115.119

but afterwards missing them there , or for some <P_4.116> other reason ,
I do not know what , his Mind altered , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.120

and he came to take them in the House : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.121

So when I met them , we rode on about ten Miles ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.122

and they would have had me to have led them a private way , over the
fording Bridge towards <font> Moyle <$$font> 's <font> Court <$$font> ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.123

but I told them , in case they intended to have me for their Guide ,
they must go the way that I could tell ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.124

but they would go that private way , and so lose their way ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.125

then they sent back this <font> Dunne <$$font> to <font> Marton <$$font>
to one <font> Fane <$$font> , that was the fat Man that sent him :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.126

but I finding that I was of no more value then , rode away from them ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.127

and having a Relation that liv'd on that side of the country , I went to
let Colonel <font> Pennruddock <$$font> know that they were at the House
. LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.128

But before I went away from them , <font> Nelthorp <$$font> gave me five
Shillings , half a Crown , and two Shillings and a Six-pence .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.129

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Now thou say'st <font> Nelthorp <$$font> did
: LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.130

Didst thou hear his Name named ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.131

<font> Barter . <$$font> I never could find any of their Names till
they were taken . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.132

Mr. <font> Pollexfen . <$$font> Pray , <font> Barter <$$font> , what
Discourse had you with <font> Dunne <$$font> the first time you were
going to and from my Lady <font> Lisle@ @'s <$$font> concerning the Men
that he was to bring thither , and what Estates they had ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.133

<font> Barter . <$$font> My Lord , he said they had half a Score of
Thousands of Pounds a Year a-piece . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.134

Mr. <font> Pollexfen . <$$font> Did he tell you they were to come to
my Lady's ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.135

<font> Barter . <$$font> Yes , he told me they were to come upon the
<font> Tuesday <$$font> , and they were to come such a Way , and were to
come to my Lady's in the Evening . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.136

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What wer't thou to have for thy pains ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.137

<font> Barter . <$$font> I made no Bargain , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.138

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You are all very free , kind-hearted People
, I say that for you . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.139

Mr. <font> Pollexfen . <$$font> What did <font> Dunne <$$font> say
about his Gains ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.140

<font> Barter . <$$font> He told me he had a very fine Booty for his
part , and that he should never want Money again , and that I should be
very well paid , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.141

and gave me half a Crown . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.142

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then let my honest Man , Mr. <font> Dunne
<$$font> , stand forward a little . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.143

Come , Friend , you have had some time to recollect yourself ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.144

let us see whether we can have the Truth out of you now :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.145

You talked of carrying a Message from <font> Hicks <$$font> to my Lady
<font> Lisle <$$font> ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.146

Did not you carry a Letter ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.147

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> No my Lord , I did not .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.148

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not you shew a Letter to the Bailiff ,
<font> Carpenter ? <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.149

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , I did not .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.150

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What say you , <font> Barter <$$font> , to
that ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.151

<font> Barter . <$$font> My Lord , I did see him produce the Letter to
the Bailiff . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.152

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then I will ask you another Question :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.153

Did you not tell <font> Barter <$$font> that you should be at <font>
Salisbury-Plain <$$font> , with two People , upon the <font> Tuesday ?
<$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.154

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , I said between <font> Compton
<$$font> and <font> Fovant <$$font> . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.155

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not you tell him , that they were brave
Fellows , and had God knows how many Thousand Pounds a year a-piece ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.156

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , I did not .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.157

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then one thing more :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.158

Did not you tell him , that you told my Lady , when she asked whether he
was acquainted with the Concern , that he knew nothing of the Business ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.159

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I did tell him so .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.160

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you so ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.161

Then you and I must have a little further Discourse :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.162

Come now , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.163

and tell us , what Business was that ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.164

And tell it us so , that a Man may understand and believe that thou dost
speak Truth . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.165

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Does your Lordship ask what that Business was ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.166

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Yes , it is a plain Question ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.167

What was that Business that my Lady asked thee , whether the other Man
knew ; and then you answered her , that he did know nothing of it ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.168

<bracket> <font> Then he paused a while . <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.169

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Remember , Friend , thou art upon thy Oath ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.170

and remember withal , that it is not thy Life , but thy Soul that is now
in danger : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.171

therefore I require from thee a plain Answer to a very plain Question ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.172

What was that Business my Lady enquired after , whether the other Fellow
knew , and thou told'st her , he did not ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.173

<bracket> Dunne <font> made no Answer , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.174

but stood musing a while . <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.175

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> He is studying and musing how he shall
prevaricate ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.176

but thou had'st better tell the Truth , Friend :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.177

remember what thou has said already ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.178

thou hast said , That thou didst tell that Man , that the Lady asked you
, whether he knew any thing of the Business , and thou told'st her , he
did not ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.179

Now I would know what that Business was . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.180

<bracket> <font> Still he made no Answer , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.181

but seemed to muse . <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.182

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Look thee , if thou canst not comprehend
what I mean , I will repeat it to thee again ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.183

for thou shalt see what Countryman I am , by my telling my Story over
twice : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.184

Therefore I ask thee once again . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.185

Thou said'st thy Lady asked thee , whether he knew of the Business ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.186

and thou told'st her , he did not . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.187

Now let us know what that Business was ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.188

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I can@ @not mind it , my Lord , what it was .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.189

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But mind me , pri@ @thee :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.190

Thou didst tell that honest Man there , that my Lady <font> Lisle
<$$font> asked thee , whether he knew any thing of the Business ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.191

and thou said'st , no . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.192

What was that Business ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.193

<font> Dunne . <$$font> That Business that <font> Barter <$$font> did
not know of ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.194

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Yes , that is the Business ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.195

be ingenuous , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.196

tell the Truth : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.197

Oh ! How hard the Truth is to come out of a lying Presbyterian Knave .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.198

Pri@ @thee , Friend , consider the Oath that thou hast taken , and that
thou art in the presence of a God that can@ @not endure a Lye , nor
whose Holiness will not admit him to dispense with a Lye :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.199

Consider that that God is an infinite Being of Purity , Holiness , and
Truth ; and it would be inconsistent with his Being to dispense with the
least Untruth ; and thou hast called him to witness , that thou would'st
testify the Truth , the whole Truth , and nothing but the Truth .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.200

I charge thee , therefore , as thou wilt answer it to that God of Truth
, and that thou may'st be called to do , for ought I know , the very
next Minute , and there thou wilt not be able to palliate the Truth ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.201

what was that Business you and my Lady spoke of ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.202

<bracket> <font> Then he paused for half a quarter of an Hour ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.203

and at last said : <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.204

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I can@ @not give an Account of it , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.205

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Oh blessed God ! LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.206

Was there ever such a Villain upon the Face of the Earth ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.207

to what Times are we reserved ! LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.208

Dost thou believe that there is a God ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.209

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Yes , my Lord , I do .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.210

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou believe , that that God can endure
a Lye ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.211

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , I know he can@ @not .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.212

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And doest thou believe then that he is a God
of Truth ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.213

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Yes , my Lord , I do .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.116.214

<P_4.117>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou think that the God of Truth may
Immediately sink thee into Hell-Fire if thou tellest a Lye ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.216

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> I do , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.217

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou believe , that he does observe
every thing that thou thinkest , sayest , or doest ; knows the Secrets
of thy Heart , and knows whether thou tellest a Lye or not , tho'
perhaps it may be hid from us ; and knows whether thou dost prevaricate
or not ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.218

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I know , the Lord does know all things .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.219

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou believe , that he knows the
Business that you and my Lady the Prisoner were talking of , as well as
you do ; that he hath an Almighty Power over all his Creatures an
all-piercing Eye , that looks into the Hearts of every one of them , and
from which nothing can be concealed ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.220

Dost thou believe it possible to conceal that very Discourse of your's
from the knowledge of that infinite Being ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.221

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I do believe that there is a God
above . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.222

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I ask thee then again ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.223

dost thou believe , that that God above , who is a God of Truth himself
, is omniscient , omnipresent , to whom all Truth is naked and open ,
that he knows every thing that is either thought , said , or done by any
of his Creatures , sees and knows the Hearts of all Men ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.224

Dost thou believe all this ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.225

<bracket> <font> He stood silent for a good while . <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.226

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Friend , deceive not thyself ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.227

the great God does observe and know the secret workings of thy Thoughts
now , and how Truth struggles to get out , but Baseness and Villany keep
it in : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.228

All the private Imaginations of thy Heart are not only known to him ,
but registred by him , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.229

and thy Conscience will bear witness to thy Accusation when thou art
called to answer for them , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.230

and answer for them thou must ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.231

for the Scripture , that is the Word of God , tells us , <font> That
every vain Thought we must account for . <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.232

Dost thou then believe , that any Discourse between you , tho' never so
private , is private from the Almighty , All-knowing God ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.233

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I know it is not , nor can@ @not be .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.234

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I therefore once more adjure thee , as thou
wilt answer it to that God , that is the Searcher of the Hearts and
Trier of the Reins , to whom all Hearts are open , and from whom no
Secrets are hid , that thou make me a plain Answer to my Question ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.235

and as thou hast called God to bear Witness to the Truth of the Evidence
thou givest here in this Court , so I charge thee , in his Name , to
declare the Truth , and nothing but the Truth .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.236

Now tell us what was the Business you spoke of ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.237

<font> But he made no Answer . <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.238

<font> L. C. Baron . <$$font> Friend , mind what my Lord says to you
, LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.239

and consider , how easy a thing it is for a Man to speak Truth , and
give a plain Answer to a plain Question . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.240

You can@ @not but understand what my Lord asks of you ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.241

you said even now , that you did tell the other Witness , <font> Barter
<$$font> , that my Lady asked you , whether he knew any thing of the
Business ; and you told her , he did not . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.242

Now my Lord would have you tell us , what that Business was ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.243

<bracket> <font> He seemed to turn his Head on one side ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.244

but returned no Answer . <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.245

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> He is going to ask that Man there , whether
he shall tell the Truth . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.246

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord , I ask no Man any such Question .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.247

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pri@ @thee tell us the Truth then now :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.248

Thou art to know , that thou standest in the Presence of the God of
Truth , and hast called him to witness , that thou would'st tell the
Truth . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.249

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I do tell the Truth , as far as I can
remember . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.250

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then what was that you told my Lady <font>
Lisle <$$font> , <font> Barter <$$font> did not know ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.251

<font> Dunne . <$$font> What <font> Barter <$$font> did not know , my
Lord ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.252

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay , is not that a plain Question ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.253

Of all the Witnesses that ever I met with , I never saw thy fellow .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.254

<bracket> <font> He stood a good while , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.255

and made no Answer . <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.256

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I hope , Gentlemen of the Jury , you take
notice of the strange and horrible Carriage of this Fellow ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.257

and withal , you can@ @not but observe the Sprit of that sort of People
, what a villainous and devilish one it is : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.258

Good God ! LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.259

That ever the thing called Religion <paren> a Word that People have so
much abused <$$paren> should ever wind up Persons to such a height of
Impiety , that it should make them lose the Belief that there is a God
of Truth in Heaven , that sees and knows , observes and registers , and
will punish and take vengeance of Falshood and Perjury .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.260

It may well make the rest of Mankind that have any sort of Faith in a
Deity and a future Life , to abhor and detest both the Men and their
Religion , if such abonimable Principles may be called so .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.261

A <font> Turk <$$font> is a Saint to such a Fellow as this ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.262

nay a <font> Pagan <$$font> would be ashamed to be thought to have no
more Truth in him . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.263

O blessed <font> Jesus ! <$$font> What an Age do we live in ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.264

and what a Generation of Vipers do we live among ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.265

Sirs , Is this that you call the <font> Protestant Religion ! <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.266

Shall so glorious a Name be applied to so much Villany and Hypocrisy ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.267

Is this the Persuasion you hope to live , and die , and find Salvation
in ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.268

Will any of you all , Gentlemen , be contented to die with a Lye in your
Mouth ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.269

Do not you all expect , according to the Orthodox Doctrine of the Church
of <font> England <$$font> , that eternal Damnation will be the Portion
of Lyars ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.270

And thou wicked Wretch , how durst thou appear to give Testimony before
even an earthly Tribunal with so much Impudence and Falshood , when
every Lye will cost thee so dear , except a sincere and hearty
Repentance , and the infinite Mercy of the great God interpose ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.271

I charge you once more , as you will answer it at the Bar of the great
Judge of all the World , that you tell me what that Business was you and
the Prisoner talked about : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.272

do you consider what a Condition thou bringest thyself into by all this
Shuffling and Prevarication , even as to any thing of Mercy in this Life
; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.273

for indeed it is not fit thou shoud'st have the least Hopes of Mercy on
this side Eternity , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.274

and truly there is no Man can imagine less than infinite Mercy can
pardon so flagitious a Sin , one that so impudently tells and stands in
a Lye . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.275

<bracket> <font> Still he would make no Answer . <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.276

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Jesus God ! LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.277

Was there ever such a Fellow in the World as thou art ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.278

Pri@ @thee let me ask thee once again , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.279

Dost thou believe that there is a God , that this God is spotless Truth
and Purity itself ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.280

Dost thou believe thou hast a precious and immortal Soul , that is to
live in everlasting Bliss or eternal Misery after this Life ,
accordingly as thou carriest it here ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.281

if thou doest believe it , ought not the Concerns of that precious and
immortal Soul of thine to be much dearer to thee than ten_thousand
Worlds ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.282

Does not the blessed Word of Truth tell thee , <font> What will it
profit a Man to gain the whole World , and lose his own Soul ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.117.283

Or what shall a Man give in <P_4.118> exchange for his Soul ? <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.284

Is not this the Voice of Scripture itself ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.285

And wilt thou hazard so dear and precious a thing for a Lye , and an
unprofitable Lye too ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.286

Thou Wretch ! LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.287

All the Mountains and Hills in the World heaped upon one another , will
not cover thee from the Vengeance of the Great God for this
Transgression of false Witness-bearing : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.288

What hopes can there be for so profligate a Villain as thou art , that
so impudently stands in open defiance of the Omnipresence , Omniscience
, and Justice of God , by persisting in so palpable A Lye ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.289

I therefore require it of you , in his Name , to tell me the Truth .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.290

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I can@ @not tell what to say , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.291

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Good God ! Was there ever such an impudent
Rascal ! LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.292

Well , I will try once more , and tell thee what I mean ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.293

you said you told that honest Man <paren> for truly he seems so to be
<$$paren> that my Lady asked you whether he knew of the Business ; and
you told her , he did not : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.294

Pri@ @thee be so free as to tell us what the Business was ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.295

<bracket> Dunne <font> paused LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.296

and would make no Answer . <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.297

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pri@ @thee what didst thou mean , or thy
Lady mean , by that Business ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.298

<bracket> <font> He paused again , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.299

but would make no Answer . <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.300

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why , pri@ @thee , dost thou think thou dost
her a Kindness by this way of proceeding ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.301

Sure thou can'st not think so ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.302

for such a sort of Carriage were enough to convict her , if there were
nothing else . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.303

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Truly , my Lord , I do not think to do her any
Kindness at all . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.304

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then pri@ @thee let me persuade thee to have
some kindness for thyself ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.305

look to thy own Soul that is in great peril of everlasting Ruin and
Destruction by these means ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.306

dost thou call this Religion ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.307

It is a prodigious piece of Religion ! LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.308

Come , pray tell me what Business it was you talked of ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.309

You should not have asked me a Question so often , but I would have
given you a plain Answer , though I were not under the Obligation of an
Oath , as you are . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.310

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , pray ask the Question over again once
more , and I will tell you . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.311

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I will so , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.312

and I will ask it you with all the Calmness , and Seriousness , and
Candour , that I can ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.313

if I know my own Heart , it is not in my Nature to desire the Hurt of
any body , much less to delight in their eternal Perdition ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.314

no , it is out of tender compassion to you that I use all these Words :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.315

I would have thee to have some regard to thy precious and immortal Soul
, which is more valuable than the whole World ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.316

reflect upon that Scripture again which I mentioned before , which must
be true , because it is the Words of him that is Truth itself :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.317

<font> What shall it profit a Man to gain the whole World , and lose his
own Soul ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.318

Or what shall a Man give in exchange for his Soul ? <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.319

If that Soul of thine be taken away , what is the Body fit for , but
like a putrid Carcase , to be thrust into and covered with the Dust with
which it was made : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.320

Therefore I ask you , with a great Desire that thou may'st free thyself
from so great a Load of Falshood and Perjury , tell me what the Business
was you told the Prisoner , the other Man Barter did not know ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.321

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I told her , he knew nothing of our
coming there . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.322

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nay , nay , that can never be it ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.323

for he came along with thee . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.324

<font> Dunne . <$$font> He did not know any thing of my coming there
till I met him on the way . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.325

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pri@ @thee mind my Question ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.326

sure enough thou hadst told him whither thou wert going ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.327

or else he could not have been thy Guide ; so that he must needs know of
thy coming there : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.328

but what was the Business that thou told'st her , he did not know ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.329

<font> Dunne . <$$font> She asked me , whether I did not know that
<font> Hicks <$$font> was a Nonconformist . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.330

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font> ask you
that Question ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.331

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Yes , my Lord ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.332

I told her I did not . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.333

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But that is not my Question :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.334

What was that Business that he did not know ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.335

<font> Dunne . <$$font> It was the same thing : whether Mr. <font>
Hicks <$$font> was a Nonconformist . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.336

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That can@ @not be all ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.337

there must be something more in it . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.338

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Yes , my Lord , it is all ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.339

I know nothing more . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.340

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What did she say to you when you told her ,
he did not know it ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.341

<font> Dunne . <$$font> She did not say any thing , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.342

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why , dost thou think , that after all this
pains that I have been at to get an Answer to my Question , that thou
can'st banter me with such sham Stuff as this ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.343

Hold the Candle to his Face , that we may see his brazen Face .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.344

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I tell you the Truth .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.345

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did she ask thee whether that Man knew any
thing of a Question she had asked thee , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.346

and that was only of being a Nonconformist ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.347

<font> Dunne . <$$font> Yes , my Lord , that was all .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.348

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That is all Nonsense ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.349

dost thou imagine that any Man hereabouts is so weak as to believe thee
? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.350

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I am so baulked , I do not know what
I say myself ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.351

tell me what you would have me to say , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.352

for I am cluttered out of my Senses . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.353

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why , pri@ @thee Man , there 's no body
baulks thee but thy own self ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.354

thou art asked Questions that are as plain as any thing in World can be
: LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.355

it is only thy own depraved naughty Heart that baulks both thy Honesty
and Understanding , if thou hast any ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.356

it is thy studying how to prevaricate , that puzzles and confounds thy
Intellect : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.357

but I see all the pains in the World , and all Compassion and Charity is
lost upon thee , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.358

and therefore I will say no more to thee . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.359

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font> . My Lord , because he pretends to
Ignorance what <font> Hicks <$$font> was , I desire to ask Barter one
Question : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.360

Pray , what did he tell you concerning his Carriage towards these People
? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.361

<font> Barter . <$$font> My Lord , he told me that he had concealed
them in his House ten Days before . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.362

<font> Dunne . <$$font> That I never did in my Life .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.363

<font> Barter . <$$font> I know not whether you did or no ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.364

but you told me so ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.365

and I made answer to him again , my Lord , I wonder how he were able to
keep them without being discovered , there being such search ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.366

and he answered , He did keep them in a Chamber all day , and then they
walked out at night ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.367

for the Searches of the Houses were usually at night .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.368

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I can bring testimony to the contrary
. LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.369

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But really I believe it will be no strange
thing for me to say , I do believe him rather than thee ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.118.370

I would I had half as much reason to believe <P_4.119> thee , as I have
to believe him : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.371

I would fain have thee speak truth , if I could .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.372

What say you to the Question I asked you ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.373

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I can@ @not tell what to say , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.374

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Say the Truth , Man .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.375

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I do , as I hope for mercy , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.376

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou hope for mercy ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.377

Thou hast very little reason for it , I assure thee .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.378

Well , I will try thee with another Question :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.379

Didst thou tell that Man , that it was the best Jobb thou ever hadst in
thy Life ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.380

<font> Dunne . <$$font> No my Lord , I did not .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.381

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nor nothing to that purpose ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.382

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> No , my Lord . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.383

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What say you , <font> Barter <$$font> ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.384

did not he tell you so ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.385

<font> Barter . <$$font> Yes , my Lord , he did ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.386

and that he should never lack Money again as long as he liv'd .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.387

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then I ask you one Question more , <font>
Barter <$$font> ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.388

did you tell this to Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font> ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.389

- <font> Barter . <$$font> Yes , I did , my Lord .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.390

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then that will fortify his Testimony ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.391

therefore swear him , because I would make these concealed Wretches
<paren> for in my conscience I know there are some such in the bottom of
this Business <$$paren> know , that the Truth will out one way or other
. LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.392

And as for this Fellow , I expect it from all you Gentlemen of the
King's Counsel , and others that are concerned , that you take notice
and remember what has passed here , and that an Information of Perjury
be preferred against this Fellow . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.393

<bracket> <font> Then Col. <$$font> Penruddock <font> was sworn .
<$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.394

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Col. Pennruddock , upon the Oath you have
taken , did that Man , <font> Barter <$$font> , come to you ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.395

and what did he say to you ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.396

Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font> . My Lord , that Man , <font> Barter
<$$font> , came to my House in the Morning , upon <font> Monday <$$font>
, LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.397

and told me , he had been with one <font> Dunne <$$font> , upon a
Journey to Mrs. <font> Lisle <$$font> 's House , to get Entertainment
for some People ; and that they had appointed to meet him that <font>
Tuesday <$$font> following , between nine and eleven , upon <font>
Salisbury-Plain <$$font> , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.398

and there , if I pleased , I might take them .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.399

I ordered him to go according to the Appointment ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.400

and withal , I sent a Servant of my own to watch when they came by ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.401

but it happen'd , I suppose , by their taking another way , that he
missed of them : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.402

but <font> Barter <$$font> left word , that in case he did not find them
there , we must conclude , that he was gone with them to my Lady <font>
Lisle <$$font> 's House ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.403

and he told me withal , says he , I believe they are Rebels , because he
that desired me to be their Guide , said the same to me .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.404

So early the next Morning I took some Soldiers with me ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.405

and beset my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font> 's House ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.406

it was a pretty while before I could get any body in the House to hear :
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.407

at length that Man that they say was the Bailiff , <font> Carpenter
<$$font> , came out ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.408

and I said to him Friend , you had best be free and ingenous , and
discover who are in your Lady's House , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.409

for I am sure there were some Strangers came hither last Night ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.410

let me know who they are , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.411

and shew me what part of the House they are in .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.412

He did confess to me there were Strangers in the House ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.413

and pointed to such part of the House ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.414

but pray , says he , do not tell my Mistress of it .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.415

Accordingly we went in , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.416

and immediately we took Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font> and this same <font>
Dunne <$$font> in the Malt-house . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.417

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was <font> Dunne <$$font> taken in the
Malt-house ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.418

- Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font> . Yes , he had covered himself with
some sort of Stuff there . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.419

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , what did you do then ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.420

<font> Col. Penrudduck . <$$font> My Lady afterwards coming to us , I
told her , Madam , you have done very ill in harbouring Rebels , and
giving Entertainment to the King's Enemies . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.421

Saith she , I know nothing of them ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.422

I am a Stranger to it . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.423

Pray , said I , Madam , be so free and ingenous with me , and so kind to
yourself , as if there be any other Person that is concealed in any part
of your House , <paren> for I am sure there is some body else <$$paren>
as to deliver him up , and you shall come to no further trouble .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.424

She denied it , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.425

and said , I know nothing of them : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.426

But we went on , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.427

and searched , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.428

and at last discovered the other man <font> Nelthorp <$$font> , hid in a
Hole by the Chimney . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.429

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> <font> Dunne <$$font> , how came you to hide
yourself in the Malt-house ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.430

<font> Dunne . <$$font> When I heard the stir and bustle , I went thro'
the Chamber where I lay , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.431

and came into that Room where I was taken . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.432

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> When thou heard'st a stir and a bustle , why
wert thou afraid of any thing ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.433

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I was frighted at the noise .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.434

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Pri@ @thee , what need'st thou be afraid ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.435

for thou didst not know <font> Hicks <$$font> , nor <font> Nelthorp
<$$font> ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.436

and my Lady only asked thee , whether <font> Hicks <$$font> were a
Nonconformist Parson : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.437

Thou art a very innocent Soul , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.438

and surely needest no occasion to be afraid .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.439

I doubt there was something of that <font> Business <$$font> in the Case
that we were talking of before , if we could but get out of thee what it
was . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.440

<font> Dunne . <$$font> My Lord , I heard a great noise in the House ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.441

and I did not know what it meant ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.442

and so I went LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.443

and hid myself . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.444

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Alack-a-day ! LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.445

That is very strange , that thou should'st hide thyself for a little
noise , when thou knewest nothing of the Business , nor wert acquainted
with any thing of the matter at all . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.446

But Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font> , I would ask you one Question more
: LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.447

Did that honest Man tell you , that <font> Dunne <$$font> had told him ,
that it was the best Jobb that ever he had in his life , and that he
should want no Money : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.448

- Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font> . I can@ @not tell that truly , my
Lord ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.449

I do not remember that : LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.450

but he said , he apprehended them to be Rebels , and that <font> Dunne
<$$font> told him as much . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.451

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What do you say to that , <font> Dunne
<$$font> ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.452

It seems you told <font> Barter <$$font> , that you apprehended them to
be Rebels . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.453

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I apprehend them for Rebels , my Lord !
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.454

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No , no , you did not apprehend them for
Rebels , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.455

but you hid them for Rebels . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.456

But did you say to <font> Barter <$$font> , that you took them to be
Rebels ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.457

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> I take them to be Rebels !
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.458

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You Blockhead , I ask you , did you tell him
so ? LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.459

<font> Dunne . <$$font> I tell <font> Barter <$$font> so !
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.460

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay , is not that a plain Question ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.461

- <font> Dunne . <$$font> I am quite cluttered out of my senses ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.462

I do not know what I say . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.463

<font> A Candle being still held nearer his Nose . <$$font>
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.464

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But to tell the Truth , would rob thee of
none of thy Senses , if ever thou hadst any ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.465

but it should seem that neither thou , nor thy Mistress the Prisoner had
any , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.466

for she knew nothing of it neither , though she had sent for them
thither . LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.467

Mr. <font> Pollexfen . <$$font> Pray , Col. <font> Penruddock
<$$font> , did you tell her you came to search for Rebels ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.468

Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font> . Yes , Sir , I told her as soon as I
saw her ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.469

but we had a good while beset the House before any body answered us ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.470

at length , there were some Ladies , or Gentlewomen , I imagined them to
be her Daughters , that upon our noise looked out at the Window ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.119.471

and I told them there were <P_4.120> Rebels in the House ,
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.120.472

and I required them in the King's Name to be deliver'd to me ;
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.120.473

but I saw not my Lady till after I had brought out Hicks and <font>
Dunne . <$$font> LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.120.474

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What said she to you ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.120.475

Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font> . She said , she knew nothing of their
being in the House ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.120.476

but I told her there was some body else besides , and she would do well
to deliver him without trouble ; LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.120.477

but she denying of it , we search'd further , LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.120.478

and found <font> Nelthorp <$$font> , as I told you .
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.120.479

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But she denied it first , it seems ?
LISLE-1685-E3-P2,4.120.480
