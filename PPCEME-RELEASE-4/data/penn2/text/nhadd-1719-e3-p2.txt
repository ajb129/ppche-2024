Five days ago we had a battle w=th= the Spanish fleet off of Cape
Passaro , on the Island of Sicily , in w=ch= severall of their ships
were taken and some destroyd . NHADD-1719-E3-P2,53.9

behaviour that day . NHADD-1719-E3-P2,53.11

I shall soon be orderd to be refitted at Port Mahon , the ship requiring
it . NHADD-1719-E3-P2,53.12

I had fifty men killd and wounded . NHADD-1719-E3-P2,53.13

Among the former was L=t= Bramble , who was appointed by the intrest of
Sir Cha. Wager . NHADD-1719-E3-P2,53.14

My Cousin Haddock chased towards the shoar after part of the Spanish
fleet , when they separated , w=th= 4 or 5 other ships whose signalls
were made for that purpose , NHADD-1719-E3-P2,54.16

and they are not yet come into the fleet . NHADD-1719-E3-P2,54.17

However , I doubt not but he is well ; the ships that they were sent
after being of the smaller sort . NHADD-1719-E3-P2,54.18

My dear Spouse , I send this to tell you I am well .

forced ashoar on Sicily a Spanish man of war of 70 guns , w=ch= is
overset and sunk . NHADD-1719-E3-P2,54.30

I rec=d= some shot from her , but without much damage .

Oake , and Rochester , to block up Camock , who is at Messina and will
not venture out , <P_55> his squadron being much inferiour to us .
NHADD-1719-E3-P2,55.32

By the news we receive from England , I conjecture Spain will soon be
oblidgd to accept the terms proposed to 'em ; after w=ch= I suppose the
bigger ships will be orderd home , where I shall always be glad to be ,
whenever it consists w=th= my honour ; NHADD-1719-E3-P2,55.33
