THE DESCRIPTION and vse of the Tables of <font> Tangents and Secants .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57R.4

<$$heading>

Evclid in the second proposition of his third Booke defineth the line
Tangent in this sort . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57R.6

A right line <paren> saith he <$$paren> is said to touch a circle when
it toucheth it so as being drawn out in length , it woulde neuer cut the
saide Circle . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57R.7

The line Secant is not by him any wher defined ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57R.8

but what these two lines are , you shall better vnderstand by this
figure Demonstratiue here following , then by any definition that can be
made thereof : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57R.9

for a definition ought to bee plaine and briefe , and not long ,
intricate or doubtfull , which will be hardly performed in shewing the
nature of these two lines by way of definition ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57R.10

and therefore marke well this figure following .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57R.11

{COM:figure_omitted} In this figure you see first a Circle drawne vpon
the Centre <font> C. <$$font> from which Centre is extended to the
circumference of the Circle a right line , called the Semidiameter ,
marked with the letters <font> A. C. <$$font>
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57R.12

then there is another right line which toucheth the said Circle , and
also the outermost end of the said Semi-diameter making therewith a
right Angle in the point <font> A. <$$font> and is called the line
Tangent BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57R.13

then ther is a third line which proceeding from the Centre <font> C.
<$$font> doth cut the circumference of the Circle in the point <font> B.
<$$font> & also meeteth with the line Tangent in the point <font> D
<$$font> and therfore is called y=e= line Secant , betweene which two
lines , I meane the Tangent & Secant , is intercepted or included a
certaine portion <P_57V> or arch of the foresaid Circle , lesse then a
Quadrant marked with the letters <font> A. B. <$$font> of which Arke
the line <font> A. D. <$$font> is the Tangent , and the line <font> C.
D. <$$font> is the Secant thereof , which must needes meete with the
Tangent in the point <font> D. <$$font> because that the two Angles
<font> C. A. D <$$font> , and <font> D. C. A. <$$font> are lesser
then two right Angles , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.14

for the one is right , and the other sharpe , by reason that the Arke is
lesse then a Quadrant . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.15

And some doe call the line Tangent the line <font> Ascript <$$font> ,
because it is ascribed to the Circle , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.16

and they call the line Secant the <font> Hipothenuse <$$font> , because
it subtendeth the right Angle <font> A. <$$font>
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.17

& they call the Semidiameter or totall Sine , the base of y=e= rectangle
Triangle <font> C. A. D. <$$font> which is called a rectangle
Triangle because it contayneth one right Angle marked with the letter
<font> A. <$$font> BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.18

and note that when soeuer any maner of Angle is propounded by three
letters , that the middle letter doth alwayes signifie the Angle
propounded , be it right , sharpe , or blunt .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.19

Now if you would know to what ende the foresaid two lines were inuented
, and wherto they serue you have to vnderstand that they chiefly serue
in calculating the quantitie of Angles and their sides , as well in
right_lined Triangles as in sphericall Triangles ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.20

for the sides of Triangles are either right or crooked ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.21

and if they haue right sides , such Triangles are eyther right_angled
Triangles , or oblique_angled Triangles , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.22

and you haue to note that the quantitie of euery Angle is to be measured
by the arch of a Circle subtending that angle ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.23

for the point of every Angle is imagined to be the Centre of a whole
Circle , which you may suppose to bee so great or little as you will ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.24

for euery Circle <paren> bee it great or little <$$paren> is deuided
into 360. degrees , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.25

and looke how many degrees and minutes the arch subtending that Angle
containeth , so much is the quantitie of that Angle , the practise
whereof is very wel set downe by <font> Clauius <$$font> in his
commentaries vpon <font> Theodosius <$$font> , which I minde <paren> God
willing <$$paren> hereafter to translate into our mother tongue :
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.26

In the meane time my intention here , is onely to shew you by one
example or two , the vse of the Tables made for the foresaid lines
Tangent and Secant . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.27

<heading>

The vse of the said Tables according to Clauius , is thus .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,57V.29

<$$heading>

In seeking out the Tangent or Secant of any Arke giuen , or of the
complement of any Arke by either of these Tables , you haue <P_58R> to
obserue the selfe_same order which you did before in finding out the
right Sine of any Arke giuen , or of the complement of any Arke , <font>
Per tabulas sinuum <$$font> . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58R.31

As for example , if you would finde out the Tangent of an Arke
containing 50. degrees , 2 ' 4. then resort to the Table of Tangents
in the front , wherof looke first for the Arke 50. degrees , and then
in the first collum on the left hand of the said table , for 2 ' 4.
right against which on the right hand vnder the Arke 50. you shall
finde in the common Angle the Tangent to bee 12$$087$$923. the total
Sine wherof is 10$$000$$000. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58R.32

but if you would find out the Secant of the foresaid Arke 50. and 2 '
4. then you must resort to the table of Secants ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58R.33

and hauing found out the Arke 50 , in the front of the said Tables , and
the 2 ' 4. on the left hand as before , you shall find in the commen
Angle the Secant to be 15688144. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58R.34

And if you would haue the Tangent of the complement of the said Arke
which is 39. degrees , and 3 ' 6. you shall find the 39. degrees of
the complement in the foot of the table of Tangents right vnder the Arke
50. & the 3 ' 6. in the outermost collum on the right hand of the said
table , with which complement you must enter the table of Tangents ,
seeking for 39. degrees in the front of the table , and 3 ' 6. in the
first collum on the left hand of the said table , right against which in
the common Angle you shall finde 8272720. to be the Tangent of 39.
degrees 3 ' 6. which is the complement of 50 degrees , 2 ' 4.
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58R.35

And you must worke in like manner with the table of Secants :
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58R.36

As for example , if you would find the Secant of 72. degrees , 3 ' 6.
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58R.37

first then enter the table of Secants , looking for 72. degrees aboue
in the front of the table , and 36. in the first collum on the left
hand of the said table , and in the common Angle you shall find
33$$440$$240. which is the Secant of 72. degrees , 3 ' 6.
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58R.38

But if you would haue the Secant of the complement of the said arch 72.
degrees , 3 ' 6. then looking in the foote of the Table right vnder 72.
degrees , you shall finde 17. degrees , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58R.39

and in the outermost collum on the right hand , iust against 3 ' 6. you
shall find 2 ' 4. so as you see that 17. degrees 2 ' 4. is the
complement of 72. degrees , 3 ' 6. with which complement you must
enter the Table of Secants , looking for 17. degrees , aboue in the
front of the Table , and for 2 ' 4. in the first collum on the left
hand of the said tables , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58R.40

& in the common Angle you shall find 10$$479$$542. to bee the Secant of
the arch 17. <P_58V> degrees , 2 ' 4. which is the complement of the
arch 72. degrees 3 ' 6. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.41

The vse of which tables in Astronomical matters , I haue here set <font>
downe as followeth <$$font> . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.43

1

To finde out the declination of the Sunne , the place thereof being
knowne . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.45

<$$heading>

Multiply the Secant of the complement of the greater declination by the
totall sine , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.47

& deuide the product by the sine of the Suns distance fro~ one of the
Equinoctial points , the quotient is the Secant of an arch , whose
complement is the declination of the Sun ; BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.48

for example , suppose that the sunne be entering into
{TEXT:zodiac_symbol} . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.49

to find the declination thereof , first I multiply 25112030. the Secant
of 66. degrees 3 ' 2. <paren> which is the complement of 23. degrees
2 ' 8. the greatest declination <$$paren> by 10000000.
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.50

the product is 251120300000000. which being diuided by 5000000.
<paren> the sine of 30. degrees the Sunnes distance from the
Equinoctiall point <$$paren> the quotient is 50224060. for which number
I seeke in the Table of Secants , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.51

the arch answering vnto it is 78. degr. 3 ' 2. the complement wherof
is 11. degrees 2 ' 9. which is the declination of the Sunne .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.52

<heading>

2 Knowing the declination of the Sunne how to finde his distance from
the Equinoctiall point , and so consequently his place in the Zodiacke .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.54

<$$heading>

Multiply the Secant of the complement of the greatest declination by the
totall sine BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.56

& deuide the product by the Secant of the complement of the declination
giuen , the quotient is the distance of the Sun from the Equinoctiall
point . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.57

As for example , the declination of the sun is supposed to be 11.
degrees 2 ' 9. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,58V.58

then to <P_59R> find his distance from the Equinoctiall , I multiply
25112030. the Secant of 66. degrees 3 ' 2. <paren> which is the
complement of the greatest declination <$$paren> by the totall sine
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.59

the product is 251120300000000. which I diuide by 50224350.
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.60

the Secant is 78. degr. 3 ' 1. the complement of 11. degrees 2 ' 9.
the supposed declination , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.61

the quotient is 5000000. the sine whereof is 30. degrees
{COM:symbol_omitted} which is the distance of the Sunne from the
Equinoctiall : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.62

then for his place you must take the same according to the season of the
yeare : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.63

for if it be in Aprill , then the Sunne is entring into <font> Taurus
<$$font> , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.64

but if it be in August it is entering into <font> Virgo <$$font> ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.65

and being in October , it is entring into <font> Scorpio <$$font> ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.66

and being in Februarie it is in the beginning of <font> Pisces <$$font>
. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.67

<heading>

3 To find out the right ascention of the Sunne .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.69

<$$heading>

Multiply the Tangent of the distance of the Sunne from the Equinoctiall
point which is nearest vnto it , by the signe of the complement of the
greatest declination , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.71

and diuide the product by the total signe , the quotient is the Tangent
of the right ascention of the Sunne , for which if you seeke in the
Table of Tangents , the arch answering vnto it is your desire :
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.72

For example the Sunne being in the first of <font> Taurus <$$font> , to
knowe the right ascention thereof , I multiply 5773502. the Tangent of
30. degrees <paren> for that 30. degrees is the distance of the Sun
from the Equinoctiall point <$$paren> by 9172920. the sine of 66.
degrees 3 ' 2. which is the complement of 23 degrees 2 ' 8. the
greatest declination . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.73

the product is 52959871965840. which being deuided by 10000000. the
totall sine , the quotient is 5295987. which is the Tangent of 27.
degrees , 5 ' 4. which is the right ascention of the Sunne beeing
entered into <font> Taurus <$$font> . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.74

<heading>

4 How to find out the declination of the Sunne knowing onely the right
ascention thereof . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.76

<$$heading>

Multiply the Tangent of the complement of the greatest declination by
the total sine , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.78

and diuide the product by the sine of the right ascention giuen , the
quotient is the Tangent of the complement of the Sunnes declination :
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59R.79

for example the right ascention <P_59V> of the Sunne being 27. degrees
5 ' 4. I would know the declination thereof , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.80

multiplying 23035062. the Tangent of 66. degrees 3 ' 2. the
complement of 23. degrees 2 ' 8. by 10000000. the product is
230370620000000. which being deuided by 4679298. the sine of the giuen
ascention the quotient is 49224856. the arch of which Tangent is 78.
degrees 3 ' 2. which being subducted out of 90. the remainder is 11.
degrees 2 ' 8. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.81

and so much is the declination of the Sunne . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.82

<heading>

5 How to finde the place of the Sunne knowing onely the right ascention
thereof . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.84

<$$heading>

Subduct the right ascention giuen out of 90. if it be lesse then 90
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.86

but if the same bee more then 90. subtract the ascention giuen out of
180. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.87

and being greater then 180. subduct the same from 30.
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.88

and multiply the Tangent of the remainder by the sine of the complement
of the greatest declination , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.89

and deuide the product by the totall sine , the quotient is the Tangent
of the complement of the Suns distance from one of the Equinoctiall
points : which distance being knowne , the place of the Sunne can now
{SIC:not} be knowne . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.90

For example , supposing the right ascention of the Sun to be 27.
degrees 5 ' 4. the complement thereof is 62. degrees 6@ @'. the
Tangent wherof is 18886715. which being multiplyed by 9172920. the
product is 173245985757800. which being deuided by 10000000 the
quotient is 17324598. for which I looke in the table of Tangents ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.91

and I finde the arch thereof to be 60. the complement wherof is 30.
which is the distance of the Sunne from the Equinoctiall point , that is
, from <font> Aries <$$font> , for that the right ascention is lesse
then 90. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.92

I say then that the Sunne is in the beginning of <font> Taurus <$$font>
. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.93

But if the right ascention had beene more then 90 , and lesse then 180.
the place of the Sunne had beene betwixt <font> Cancer <$$font> and
<font> Libra <$$font> 30. degrees from <font> Libra <$$font> ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.94

so should it haue been in the first point of <font> Virgo <$$font> ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.95

but if the right ascention had beene more then 180. the place of the
Sunne should be betwixt <font> Libra <$$font> and <font> Capricorne
<$$font> , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.96

that is in the beginning of <font> Scorpio <$$font> ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.97

but being more then 270. the place of the Sun should be betwixt <font>
Capricorne <$$font> and <font> Aries <$$font> ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,59V.98

that is in the beginning of <font> Pisces <$$font> .

6 To find out the ascentionall difference of the Sunne or any starre in
the firmament , knowing the declination thereof , and also the Latitude
of your Region . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.102

<$$heading>

Multiply the Tangent of the declination of the sunne or star by the
Tangent of the Latitude of the place , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.104

and deuide the product by the totall sine : the sine of the quotient is
the signe of the ascentionall difference , the arch whereof is the
desired ascentional difference . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.105

For example let the declination of the Sunne starre or other point in
the firmament be 10. degrees 3@ @'. and suppose the latitude to be 52.
degrees , the Tangent of 10. degrees 3. is 1772268. the Tangent of
52. degrees is 12799416. which being multiplyed together , the product
will be 2267$$4995$$395488. which being deuided by 10000000. the
totall sine , the quotient is 2267499. for which number I looke amongst
the sines , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.106

the arch answering thereunto is 13. degrees 6@ @' . which is the
ascentionall difference desired . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.107

<heading>

7 To find out the oblique ascention of the Sunne .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.109

<$$heading>

Knowing the place of the Sunne , find out the right ascention of the
same by the third proposition , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.111

and find also the ascentional difference of the same point ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.112

then if the declination of the Sun be North , subduct the ascentional
difference out of the right ascention , the remainder is the oblique
ascention . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.113

For example , suppose the Sunne to be in the beginning of <font> Taurus
<$$font> , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.114

now to finde the oblique ascention thereof in the Latitude of 52.
degrees , first by the third proposition I find out the right ascention
of the beginning of <font> Taurus <$$font> , which I find to be 27.
degrees 5 ' 4. <paren> for that the declination is North <$$paren> the
right ascention BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.115

the remainder is 12. degrees 5 ' 0. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.116

& so much is the oblique ascention for the latitude of 52. degrees .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.117

But if the Sunne be in any of the Southern sines and that the
declination be South , then the ascentionall difference is to be added
vnto the right ascention before giuen . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60R.118

<P_60V>

<heading>

8 To finde out the oblique descention of the Sunne at any time .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.121

<$$heading>

First find out the right ascention of the Sunne by the third proposition
, the same shall bee the right descention thereof ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.123

then finde the ascentionall difference by the sixt proposition ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.124

and if the Sun be in any of the Northerne signes , adde the ascentional
difference vnto the right ascention , the summe shall be the oblique
descention of the Sunne : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.125

but if it be in any of the Southerne signes , subduct the ascentionall
difference out of the right ascention , the remainder is the desired
descention : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.126

as for example the sunne being in the beginning of <font> Taurus
<$$font> , the right ascention thereof by the third proposition is 27.
degrees 5 ' 4. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.127

the ascentionall difference thereof by the sixth proposition is 15.
degrees 4@ @'. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.128

for_as_much then as <font> Taurus <$$font> is a Northerne signe , I adde
the ascentionall difference vnto the right ascention ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.129

the summe is 24. degrees 5 ' 8. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.130

& so much is the oblique descention of the Sunne being in the beginning
of <font> Taurus <$$font> . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.131

<heading>

9 To find out the length of the day or night .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.133

<$$heading>

Hauing found out the ascentionall difference by the sixth proposition ,
adde the same vnto 90. if the sunne be in any of the Northerne signes ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.135

but if it be in any of the Southerne signes , subduct the ascentionall
difference out of 90. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.136

then diuide the summe of the addition or the remainder of the
subtraction by 15. the quotient will shew the halfe length of the day
in houres and minutes , which being doubled you shall haue the whole
length of the artificiall day . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.137

For example the Sunne being in the beginning of <font> Taurus <$$font> ,
the ascentionall difference thereof is 15. degrees 4@ @'. which for
the summe is 105. degrees 4@ @'. which being deuided by 15. the
quotient is 7. houres 0@ @'. the halfe length of the day which being
doubled will be 14. houres the whole length of the artificiall day in
the Latitude of 52. degrees . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.138

<heading>

10 To finde the houre OF the Sunne his rising or setting in any Latitude
assigned . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.140

<$$heading>

First find out the halfe length of the artificiall day by the 9.
proposition , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,60V.142

and subtract the same from 12. houres , the remainder <P_61R> will shew

for example the Sun being in the beginning of <font> Taurus <$$font> to
know the houre of his rising in the Latitude of 52. degrees , by the
ninth proposition , the halfe length of the artificiall day I finde to
bee 7. houres , which I subtract from 12. houres
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.144

the remainder is 5. which sheweth that the Sun riseth at 5. of the

11 To find out the length of the planetarie houres and to find what
Planet raigneth at any houre of the day . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.148

<$$heading>

First find out the length of the artificiall day by the ninth
proposition , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.150

and diuide the same by 12. the quotient is the length of one planetarie
houre : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.151

or thus , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.152

hauing an houre of the artificial day giuen , looke what houre the same
is from the Sunne rysing , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.153

and multiply the same by 12. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.154

diuide the product by the length of the artificiall day , the quotient
is the number of the Planetarie houre . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.155

For example the sunne being in the beginning of <font> Taurus <$$font> ,
and our Latitude being 52. degrees , the length of the artificial day
by the ninth proposition is 14. houres : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.156

then doe I deuide 14. by 12. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.157

the quotient is 1$$1$$4. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.158

that is 1. houre 1 ' 0. the length of one Planetarie houre .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.159

But if an houre of the artificiall day be giuen as that I would know
what Planetarie houre it is at 9. of the clocke the Sunne being in the
first of <font> Taurus <$$font> in the Latitude of 52. degrees , hauing
found that the Sunne riseth at fiue of the clocke by the tenth
proposition , I see that 4. houres of the artificiall day are gone at
nine of the clocke , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.160

I therefore multiply 12. by 4. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.161

the product is 48. which I diuide by 14. the length of the artificiall
day , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.162

the quotient is 3$$1$$7. which is the Planetarie houre at the time set
downe : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.163

likewise shall you find the Planetarie houre of the night , finding the

and then worke with it as was shewed before for the day .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61R.165

Now to know what Planet raigneth at any houre of the day or night is
plainely set downe in the 52. Chapter which is the last Chapter of my

For example in the Latitude of 52. I would knowe what part of the
Equinoctiall is comprehended betwixt the Meridian and that Circle of
position , which is 30. degrees from the Zenith :
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61V.173

the Latitude being 52. degrees , the complement thereof is 38. degrees
, the Sine whereof is 6156615 , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61V.174

and the Tangent of 30. degrees , <paren> for that 30. is the distance
betwixt the giuen Circle of position and the Zenith <$$paren> is

<$$heading>

Multiply the Secant of the complement of the eleuation of the Pole aboue
the Circle of position by the Sine of your Latitude ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61V.180

and diuide the product by the total Sine , the quotient is the Secant of
the complement of the inclination of the circle of position vnto the
Meridian , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61V.181

and that is the distance betwixt the Circle of Position and the Zenith ,
by helpe whereof you shall find the Arch of the Equinoctiall , betwixt
the Circle of Position and the Meridian , as in the former proposition .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61V.182

As for example , suppose the eleuation of the Pole aboue the Circle of
position , in our Latitude of 52. to be 23. degrees 1 ' 2.
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,61V.183

Now to find out the Inclination <P_62R> of that Circle of Position vnto
the Meridian , first I multiply 25384445. the Secant of 66. degrees 4
' 8. <paren> for that is the complement of 23. degrees 1 ' 2. the
eleuation of the Pole aboue the Circle of position <$$paren> by 7880108
the Sine of 52. the Latitude of our Region , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,62R.184

the product is 200032168120060. which being diuided by 10000000. the
quotient is 20003216. for which I looke in the Table of Secants ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,62R.185

and the Arch thereof is 60. degrees 0@ @' . the complement whereof is
30. degrees 0@ @'. which is the Inclination of the Circle of position
vnto the Meridian , or the distance of the Zenith from the said Circle ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,62R.186

then to finde the Arch of the Equinoctiall betwixt the said Circle of
Position and the Meridian , repeate the worke of the former proposition
. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,62R.187

<heading>

14 To find out the Eleuation of the Pole aboue any assigned Circle of
Position in any giuen Latitude . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,62R.189

<$$heading>

Knowing the Inclination of the assigned Circle of Position vnto the
Meridian , Multiply the Secant of the complement thereof by the totall
Sine , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,62R.191

and diuide the product by the Sine of your Latitude , the quotient is
the Secant of the complement of the Eleuation of the Pole aboue the
giuen Circle of Position : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,62R.192

as for example , suppose the inclination of a Circle of position to bee
30. degrees 0@ @'. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,62R.193

Now to finde the eleuation of the Pole aboue the same for the Latitude
of 52. degrees 0@ @'. First take the complement of 30. degrees 0@ @'.
which is 60. degrees 0@ @'. the Secant whereof is 20000000. which
being multiplyed by the totall Sine the product is 200000000000000.
which being diuided by 7880108. the Sine of 52. the assigned Latitude
the quotient is 25$$80362. for which I seeke in the Table of Secants ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,62R.194

and the Arch answering thereunto I find to be 66. degrees 4 ' 8. the
complement whereof is , 23. degrees 1 ' 2. BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,62R.195

and so much is the Eleuation of the Pole aboue the assigned Circle of

<$$heading>

They bee great mooueable circles passing through both the Poles of the

whereof they make 180. which are halfe so many as there bee {SIC:vee}
degrees in the Equinoctiall , applying them to diuers vses not needfull

<font> Shew first what this name Colure signifieth . <$$font>
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,150V.210

This word Colure beeing compounded of <font> Colos <$$font> and <font>

for some part is alwayes seene , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.212

and some part is alwaies hidden , as that part which is aboue the

likewise that which is nigh vnto the South pole is alwaies hidden from

Spheare about , you may easilie perceiue the same .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.214

<font> Which be those Colures that are commonly set downe in the Spheare

and how are they named ? <$$font> BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.217

<$$heading>

They are two great mooueable circles , passing through the Poles of the
world , crossing one another in the said Poles with right Sphearicall
angles , by meanes whereof they deuide the whole Spheare into foure
equall partes , of which two Colures the one is called the Colure of the
Equinoxes , and the other the Colure of Solstices .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.219

<font> Describe these two Circles , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.220

& shew why they are so named ? <$$font> BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.221

The Colure of the Equinoxes is so called because it cutteth the Zodiaque
in the beginning of <font> Aries <$$font> , which is called the vernal
Equinoxe : and also in the beginning of <font> Libra <$$font> , which is
called the Autumnall Equinoxe , at which two times the daies and nightes
be equall , as hath been said before when we did speake of the
Equinoctiall circle , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.222

and this circle deuideth the Ecliptique into two halfes , the one <font>
Septentrionall <$$font> , and the other <font> Meridionall <$$font>
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.223

and thereby sheweth the signes wherein the Sunne maketh the dayes longer
and shorter than the nights , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.224

for whilest he is in the 6. Northern signes , he maketh the daies with
vs longer then the nights , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.225

and when he is in the 6. Southern signes he maketh the nightes longer
then the daies : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.226

now you haue to vnderstand that the Colure of the Solstice , is so
called because it cutteth the Zodiaque in the two Solstitiall points ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.227

that is to say , in the beginning of <font> Cancer <$$font> , and the
beginning of <font> Capricorne <$$font> , as you may see in beholding
and turning the Spheare about with your hand .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.228

<heading>

<font> Why are these two points called Solstitiall ? <$$font>
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.230

<$$heading>

They take their name of these two Latine words <font> Sol <$$font> and
<font> statio <$$font> , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.232

that is to say , the Sun and standing , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.233

for when the Sunne is in any of the two points , hee seemeth to stand
still , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151R.234

or at the least <P_151V> mooueth so little , as his proper moouing from
West to East can@ @not be easily perceiued , during the space of twelue
dayes . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.235

And you haue to note , that when the Sunne entereth into the first
degree of <font> Cancer <$$font> , which is about the 22. of Iune ,
then hee is at the highest , and the dayes be at the longest ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.236

and therefore , it is called the Summer Solstice .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.237

Againe , when hee entereth into the first degree of <font> Capricorne
<$$font> , which is about the 12. of December , then the Sunne is at
the lowest , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.238

and the nights are at the longest , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.239

& therefore it is called the Winter Solstice .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.240

And in this Colure there are set downe the two Poles of the Ecliptique
line being distant from the Poles of the world 23. degrees and 2 ' 8.
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.241

Moreouer on this Colure is measured the greatest declination of y=e= Sun
, which is alwayes equall to the distaunce of the Pole of the Ecliptique
, from the Pole of the world , as hath been said before .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.242

And you haue to note that the 4. former points , that is to say , the
2. Equinoxes , and the 2. Solstices , are commonly called the foure
cardinall or principall pointes , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.243

and of some they are called , the foure pointes of Change , signifying
the 4. beginnings of the foure diuers seasons of the yeare :
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.244

for betwixt the beginning of <font> Aries <$$font> and beginning of
<font> Cancer <$$font> , is contained the Spring time ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.245

and betwixt the beginning of <font> Cancer <$$font> and the beginning of
<font> Libra <$$font> , is the summer time : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.246

and from the beginning of <font> Libra <$$font> to the beginning of
<font> Capricorne <$$font> is the time called Autumne , or fall of the
leafe : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.247

and from the beginning of <font> Capriconre <$$font> to the beginning of
<font> Aries <$$font> is contayned the winter season , albeit the Sunne
entreth not into any of these signes alwayes at one selfe day or time of
the yeare , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.248

for at Christ his incarnation , the Sunne entred into <font> Aries
<$$font> the 25. of March , and into <font> Cancer <$$font> the 24. of
Iune , and into <font> Libra <$$font> the 27. of September , and into
<font> Capricorne <$$font> the 25. of December , which was then the
shortest day in the yeare , and the beginning of Winter ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,151V.249

and therefore is called of the Latines , <font> dies brumalis <$$font> ,
on which day Christ our Sauiour was borne , so as from the time of his
birth vnto this present yeare , there are runne almost 13. dayes ,
wherefore , vnlesse the Kalenders bee reformed as well heere in <font>

BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,159R_misnumbered_as_158R.270

and therefore some defining a starre doe say , that it is a bright and
shining body , and the thickest part of his heauen , apt both to receiue
and to reteine the light of the Sunne ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,159R_misnumbered_as_158R.271

for a starre being round of shape hath no members meete to walke from
one place to another , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,159V_misnumbered_as_158V.298

but onely changeth his place through the motion of his Spheare or heauen
wherein such Planet is fixed .

<font> May the starres be numbred by man ? <$$font>
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,159V_misnumbered_as_158V.305

<$$heading>

No , for as <font> Dauid <$$font> saith , that belongeth onely to God ,
who as hee created them , so hee can number them and call them all by
their names , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,159V_misnumbered_as_158V.307

notwithstanding the Astronomers by their industrie and diligent
obseruacion , haue attained to the knowledge of manie : as first they
know the seuen Planetes , otherwise called the wandringe starres , and
haue made manifest demonstrations of their motions , and by continuall
obseruation haue found out the manifolde vertues , powers and influences
of the same , BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,159V_misnumbered_as_158V.308

but of the fixed starres they could neuer finde more then 1022 ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,159V_misnumbered_as_158V.309

and because the starres are not equall in greatnes or bignesse , they
make sixe differences of greatnesse , appointing to the first difference
15. starres , which are bigger then all the rest , whereof euerie one
containeth the earth 207. times , to the seconde difference 45.
starres , whereof <P_160R_misnumbered_as_157R> euery one containeth the
earth 90. times . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,160R_misnumbered_as_157R.310

To y=e= third they appoint 208. starres , whereof euery one containeth
the earth 72. times . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,160R_misnumbered_as_157R.311

To the fourth difference they appoint 474. starres , whereof euery one
containeth the earth 54. times .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,160R_misnumbered_as_157R.312

To the fift they assigne 217. starres , whereof euery one containeth
the earth 57. times . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,160R_misnumbered_as_157R.313

To the sixt or last greatnesse they appoint 49. small starres , whereof
euery one containeth the earth 18. times ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,160R_misnumbered_as_157R.314

and some say 20. times .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,160R_misnumbered_as_157R.315

Besides these there be 14 others , whereof 5. be called clowdy and the
other darke , because they are not to be seene but of a very quicke and
sharpe sight . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,160R_misnumbered_as_157R.316

And you haue to note that the auncient Astronomers do deuide all the
fixed stars to them known into 48. images , wherof they liken some to
liuing things as to men , women , beasts , monsters , foules , fishes ,
and creeping wormes , and some to things without life , hauing some
artificiall shape , of which 48. images , they appoint 12. to the
Zodiaque , commonly called the 12. signes , as <font> Aries , Taurus ,
Gemini , Cancer , Leo , Virgo , Libra , Scorpio , Sagittarius ,
Capricornus , Aquarius <$$font> and <font> Pisces <$$font> .
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,160R_misnumbered_as_157R.317

Againe they place in the North part of the firmament 21. images , and
in the South part thereof 15. images , which make in all 48. The
description of all which images , together with their names hereafter
followeth : BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,160R_misnumbered_as_157R.318

and first I will describe vnto you the twelue Images contained in the
Zodiaque . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,160R_misnumbered_as_157R.319

yet these Images are not equall ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,161R_misnumbered_as_158R.356

for some doe extende , further then the Zodiaque in breadth , and some
are more then 30. degrees in length , As the Tables of <font> Alphonsus
<$$font> doe manifestly shewe , who sayeth there that the twelue Signes
doe contayne three_hundred_and_fiftie starres ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,161R_misnumbered_as_158R.357

Longitude , Latitude , and Magnitude of the saide starres ,
BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,161R_misnumbered_as_158R.358

but the Longitude of the saide stars , is farre altered from that
Longitude which they had in his time , whereof we shall speake hereafter
more at large . BLUNDEV-1597-E2-P2,161R_misnumbered_as_158R.359
