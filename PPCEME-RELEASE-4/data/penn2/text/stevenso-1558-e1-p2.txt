confesse my fault herein , at this season , STEVENSO-1558-E1-P2,51.293

But I hope you wil not iudge so much against reason .

<font> Baily <$$font> And me thinkes by your owne tale , of all that ye

STEVENSO-1558-E1-P2,51.295

The women they did nothing , as your words make probation
STEVENSO-1558-E1-P2,51.296

But stoutly withstood your forcible inuasion ,
STEVENSO-1558-E1-P2,51.297

Was it any maruaile , though the poore woman arose And start vp , being
