WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.7

<$$heading>

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Well met Brother <font> Peter <$$font> ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.9

I heard you and a friend would lodge here to_night ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.10

and that hath made me to bring my Friend to lodge here too .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.11

My Friend is one that would fain be <font> a Brother of the Angle
<$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.12

he hath been an <font> Angler <$$font> but this day ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.13

and I have taught him how to catch a <font> Chub <$$font> by daping with
a <font> Grasshopper <$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.14

and the <font> Chub <$$font> he caught was a lusty one of nineteen
inches long . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.15

But pray Brother <font> Peter <$$font> who is your companion ?
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.16

<font> Peter . <$$font> Brother <font> Piscator <$$font> , my friend is
an honest <font> Country-man <$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.17

and his name is <font> Coridon <$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.18

and he is a downright witty companion that met me here purposely to be
pleasant and eat a <font> Trout <$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.19

And I have not yet wetted my Line since we met together :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.20

but I hope to fit him with a <font> Trout <$$font> for his breakfast ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.21

for I@ @'le be early up . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.22

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Nay Brother , you shall not stay so long :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,237.23

for look you here is a Trout <P_238> will fill six reasonable bellies .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.24

Come Hostess , dress it presently , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.25

and get us what other meat the house will afford ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.26

and give us some of your best <font> Barly-wine <$$font> , the good
liquor that our honest Fore-fathers did use to drink of ; the drink
which preserved their health , and made them live so long , and to do so
many good deeds . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.27

<font> Peter . <$$font> O' my word this <font> Trout <$$font> is
perfect in season . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.28

Come , I thank you , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.29

and here is a hearty draught to you , and to all the brothers of the
Angle wheresoever they be , and to my young brothers good fortune
to_morrow : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.30

I will furnish him with a Rod , if you will furnish him with the rest of
the Tackling ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.31

we will set him up and make him a Fisher . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.32

And I will tell him one thing for his encouragement , that his fortune
hath made him happy to be Scholar to such a Master ; a Master that knows
as much both of the nature and breeding of fish as any man : and can
also tell him as well how to catch and cook them , from the <font>
Minnow <$$font> to the <font> Salmon <$$font> , as any that I ever met
withall . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.33

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Trust me , brother <font> Peter <$$font> , I find
my Scholar to be so sutable to my own humour , which is to be free and
pleasant , and civilly merry , that my resolution is to hide nothing
that I know from him . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.34

Believe me , Scholar , this is my resolution ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.35

and so here@ @'s to you a hearty draught , and to all that love us , and
the honest Art of Angling . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.36

<font> Ven. <$$font> Trust me , good Master , you shall not sow your
seed in barren ground , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.37

for I hope to return you an increase answerable to your hopes ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.38

but however you shall find me obedient , and thankful , and serviceable
to my best abilitie . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.39

<font> Pisc. <$$font> 'T@ @is enough , honest Scholar ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.40

Come my friend <font> Coridon <$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.42

this <font> Trout <$$font> looks lovely , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.43

it was twentie_two inches when it was taken , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.44

and the belly of it looked some part of it as yellow as a Marigold , and
part of it as white as a lilly , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.45

and yet me@ @thinks it looks better in this good sawce .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.46

<font> Cor. <$$font> Indeed honest friend , it looks well ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.47

and tastes well , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.48

I thank you for it , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.49

and so doth my friend <font> Peter <$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.50

or else he is to blame . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.51

<font> Pet. <$$font> Yes , and so I do , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.52

we all thank you , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,238.53

and when we have <P_239> supt , I will get my friend <font> Coridon
<$$font> to sing you a Song for requital . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.54

<font> Cor. <$$font> I will sing a song , if any body will sing another
; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.55

else , to be plain with you , <font> I will sing none <$$font> :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.56

I am none of those that sing for meat , but for company :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.57

I say , <font> T@ @is merry in Hall , when men sing all . <$$font>
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.58

<font> Pisc. <$$font> I@ @'l promise you I@ @'l sing a song that was
lately made at my request , by Mr. <font> William Basse <$$font> , one
that hath made the choice songs of the <font> Hunter in his cariere
<$$font> , and of <font> Tom of Bedlam <$$font> , and many others of
note ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.59

and this that I will sing is in praise of Angling .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.60

<font> Cor. <$$font> And then mine shall be the praise of a Country
mans life : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.61

What will the rest sing of ? WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.62

<font> Pet. <$$font> I will promise you , I will sing another song in
praise of Angling to_morrow night , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.63

for we will not part till then , but Fish to_morrow , and sup together ,
and the next day every man leave Fishing , and fall to his businesse .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.64

<font> Venat. <$$font> 'T@ @is a match , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.65

and I will provide you a Song or a Catch against then too , which shall
give some addition of mirth to the company ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.66

for we will be civil and as merry as beggers . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.67

<font> Pisc. <$$font> 'T@ @is a match my Masters ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.68

let@ @s ev'n say Grace , and turn to the fire , drink the other cup to
wet our whistles , and so sing away all sad thoughts .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.69

Come on my Masters , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.70

who begins ? WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.71

I think it is best to draw cuts , and avoid contention .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.72

<font> Pet. <$$font> It is a match . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.73

Look , the shortest cut falls to <font> Coridon <$$font> .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.74

<font> Cor. <$$font> Well then , I will begin ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.75

for I hate contention . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,239.76

{COM:song_omitted}

<P_241>

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Well sung <font> Coridon <$$font> ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.79

this song was sung with mettle ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.80

and it was choicely fitted to the occasion ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.81

I shall love you for it as long as I know you ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.82

I would you were a brother of the Angle , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.83

for a companion that is chearful , and free from swearing and scurrilous
discourse , is worth gold . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.84

I love such mirth as does not make friends ashamed to look upon one
another next morning ; nor men <paren> that can@ @not well bear it
<$$paren> to repent the money they spend when they be warmed with drink
: WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.85

and take this for a rule , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.86

You may pick out such times and such companies , that you may make your
selves merrier for a little than a great deal of money ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.87

for <font> T@ @is the company and not the charge that makes the feast
<$$font> : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.88

and such a companion you prove , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.89

I thank you for it . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.90

But I will not complement you out of the debt that I owe you ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.91

and therefore I will begin my Song and wish it may be so well liked .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,241.92

{COM:song_omitted}

<P_243>

<font> Cor. <$$font> Well sung WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.95

brother , you have paid your debt in good coin ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.96

we Anglers are all beholding to the good man that made this Song .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.97

Come Hostess , give us more Ale , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.98

and let@ @s drink to him . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.99

And now let@ @s every one go to bed that we may rise early ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.100

but first let@ @s pay our reckoning , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.101

for I will have nothing to hinder me in the morning ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.102

for my purpose is to prevent the Sun-rising . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.103

<font> Pet. <$$font> A match ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.104

Come <font> Coridon <$$font> , you are to be my Bed-fellow :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.105

I know , brother , you and your Scholar will lie together ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.106

but where shall we meet to_morrow night ? WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.107

for my friend <font> Coridon <$$font> and I will go up the water towards
<font> Ware <$$font> . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.108

<font> Pisc. <$$font> And my Scholar and I will go down towards <font>
Waltham <$$font> . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.109

<font> Cor. <$$font> Then let@ @s meet here , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.110

for here are fresh sheets that smell of <font> Lavender <$$font> ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.111

and I am sure we can@ @not expect better meat , or better usage in any
place . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.112

<font> Pet. <$$font> 'T@ @is a match . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.113

Good night to every body . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.114

<font> Pisc. <$$font> And so say I . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.115

<font> Venat. <$$font> And so say I . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.116

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Good morrow good Hostess , I see my brother
<font> Peter <$$font> is still in bed : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.117

Come give my Scholar and me a Morning-drink , and a bit of meat to
breakfast , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.118

and be sure to get a good dish of meat or two against supper ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.119

for we shall come home as hungry as Hawks . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.120

Come Scholar , let@ @s be going . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,243.121

<font> Venat. <$$font> Well now , good Master , as we walk towards the
<P_244> River give me direction , according to your promise , how I
shall fish for a <font> Trout <$$font> . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.122

<font> Pisc. <$$font> My honest Scholar , I will take this very
convenient opportunity to do it . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.123

The Trout is usually caught with a worm or a <font> Minnow <$$font> ,
<paren> which some call a <font> Penk <$$font> <$$paren> or with a
<font> flie , viz. <$$font> either a <font> natural <$$font> or an
<font> artificial flie <$$font> : concerning which three I will give you
some observations and directions . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.124

And first for Worms : Of these there be very many sorts ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.125

some breed only in the earth , as the <font> Earth-worm <$$font> ;
others of or amongst Plants , as the <font> Dug-worm <$$font> ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.126

and others breed either out of excrements , or in the bodies of living
creatures , as in the horns of Sheep or Deer ; or some of dead flesh ,
as the <font> Maggot <$$font> or <font> gentle <$$font> , and others .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.127

Now these be most of them particularly good for particular Fishes :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.128

but for the <font> Trout <$$font> the <font> dew-worm <$$font> , <paren>
which some also call the <font> Lob-worm <$$font> <$$paren> and the
<font> Brandling <$$font> are the chief ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.129

and especially the first for a great Trout , and the latter for a less .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.130

There be also of <font> Lob-worms <$$font> some called <font>
squirrel-tailes <$$font> , <paren> a worm that has a red head , a streak
down the back and a broad tail <$$paren> which are noted to be the best
, because they are the toughest and most lively , and live longest in
the water : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.131

for you are to know , that a dead worm is but a dead bait and like to
catch nothing , compared to a lively , quick , stirring worm :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.132

and for a <font> Brandling <$$font> , he is usually found in an old
dunghil , or some very rotten place near to it : but most usually in
Cow-dung , or hogs-dung , rather than horse-dung , which is somewhat too
hot and dry for that worm . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,244.133

But the best of them are to be found in the bark of the <P_245> Tanners
which they cast up in heaps after they have used it about their leather
. WALTON-1676-E3-P2,245.134

There are also divers other kinds of worms which for colour and shape
alter even as the ground out of which they are got : as the <font>
marsh-worm <$$font> , the <font> tag-tail <$$font> , the <font>
flag-worm <$$font> , the <font> dock-worm <$$font> , the <font> oakworm
<$$font> , the <font> gilt-tayle <$$font> , the <font> twachel <$$font>
or <font> lob-worm <$$font> <paren> which of all others is the most
excellent bait for a <font> Salmon <$$font> <$$paren> and too many to
name , even as many sorts , as some think there be of several hearbs or
shrubs , or of several kinds of birds in the air ; of which I shall say
no more , but tell you , that what worms soever you fish with , are the
better for being well scowred , that is long kept , before they be used
; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,245.135

and in case you have not been so provident , then the way to cleanse and
scowr them quickly , is to put them all night in water , if they be
<font> Lob-worms <$$font> , and then put them into your bag with fennel
: WALTON-1676-E3-P2,245.136

but you must not put your Brandlings above an hour in water , and then
put them into fennel for suddain use : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,245.137

but if you have time and purpose to keep them long , then they be best
preserved in an earthen pot with good store of <font> Mosse <$$font> ,
which is to be fresh every three or four dayes in Summer , and every
week or eight dayes in Winter : or at least the mosse taken from them ,
and clean washed , and wrung betwixt your hands till it be dry ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,245.138

and then put it to them again . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,245.139

And when your worms , especially the Brandling , begins to be sick , and
lose of his bigness , then you may recover him , by putting a little
milk or cream <paren> about a spoonful in a day <$$paren> into them by
drops on the mosse ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,245.140

and if there be added to the cream an {SIC:as} egge beaten and boiled in
it , then it will both fatten and preserve them long .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,245.141

And note , that when the <font> knot <$$font> , which is near to the
middle of the <font> brandling <$$font> begins to swell , then he is
sick , and , if he be not well look'd to , is near dying .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,245.142

And for mosse , you are to note , that there be divers kinds of it ,
which I could name to you , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,245.143

but will onely tell you , that that which is likest a <font> Bucks-Horn
<$$font> is the best , except it be soft white moss , <P_246> which
grows on some heaths , and is hard to be found .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.144

And note , that in a very dry time , when you are put to an extremity
for worms , Walnut-tree leaves squeez'd into water , or salt in water ,
to make it bitter or salt , and then that water poured on the ground ,
where you shall see worms are used to rise in the night , will make them
to appear above ground presently . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.145

And you may take notice some say that <font> Camphire <$$font> put into
your bag with your mosse and worms , gives them a strong and so tempting
a smell , that the fish fare the worse and you the better for it .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.146

And now , I shall shew you how to bait your hook with a worm , so as
shall prevent you from much trouble , and the loss of many a hook too ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.147

when you Fish for a <font> Trout <$$font> with a running line : that is
to say , when you fish for him by hand at the ground , I will direct you
in this as plainly as I can , that you may not mistake .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.148

<font> Suppose it be a big Lob-worm , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.149

put your hook into him somewhat above the middle , and out again a
little below the middle : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.150

having so done , draw your worm above the arming of your hook ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.151

but note that at the entring of your hook it must not be at the head-end
of the worm , but at the tail-end of him , <paren> that the point of
your hook may come out toward the head-end <$$paren>
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.152

and having drawn him above the arming of your hook , then put the point
of your hook into the very head of the worm , till it come near to the
place where the point of the hook first came out :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.153

and then draw back that part of the worm that was above the shank or
arming of your hook , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.154

and so fish with it . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.155

And if you mean to fish with two worms , then put the second on before
you turn back the hooks-@ @head of the first worm ; you can@ @not lose
above two or three worms before you attain to what I direct you ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.156

and having attain'd it , you will find it very useful , and thank me for
it : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.157

For you will run on the ground without tangling . <$$font>
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.158

Now for the <font> Minnow <$$font> or <font> Penk <$$font> , he is not
easily found and caught till <font> March <$$font> , or in <font> April
<$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,246.159

for then he appears first in the River , Nature having taught him to
shelter and hide himself in the Winter in ditches that be near to the
River , and there both to hide and keep himself warm in the mud or in
the weeds , <P_247> which rot not so soon as in a running River , in
which place if he were in Winter , the distempered Floods that are
usually in that season , would suffer him to take no rest , but carry
him head-long to Mills and Weires to his confusion .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.160

And of these <font> Minnows <$$font> , first you are to know , that the
biggest size is not the best ; and next , that the middle size and the
whitest are the best : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.161

and then you are to know , that your <font> Minnow <$$font> must be so
put on your hook that it must turn round when 't@ @is drawn against the
stream , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.162

and that it may turn nimbly , you must put it on a big-sized hook as I
shall now direct you , which is thus . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.163

Put your hook in at his mouth and out at his gill ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.164

then having drawn your hook 2 or 3 inches beyond or through his gill ,
put it again into his mouth , and the point and beard out at his taile ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.165

and then tie the hook and his taile about very neatly with a white thred
, which will make it the apter to turn quick in the water :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.166

that done , pull back that part of your line which was slack when you
did put your hook into the <font> Minnow <$$font> the second time :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.167

I say pull that part of your line back so that it shall fasten the head
, so that the body of the <font> Minnow <$$font> shall be almost
streight on your hook ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.168

this done , try how it will turn by drawing it cross the water or
against a stream , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.169

and if it do not turn nimbly , then turn the tail a little to the right
or left hand , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.170

and try again , till it turn quick ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.171

for if not , you are in danger to catch nothing ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.172

for know , that it is impossible that it should turn too quick :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.173

And you are yet to know , that in case you want a <font> Minnow <$$font>
, then a small <font> Loch <$$font> or a <font> Stickle-bag <$$font> ,
or any other small fish that will turn quick will serve as well :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.174

And you are yet to know , that you may salt them , and by that means
keep them ready and fit for use three or four days , or longer , and
that of salt , bay-salt is the best . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.175

And here let me tell you , what many old Anglers know right well , that
at some times , and in some waters a <font> Minnow <$$font> is not to be
got , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.176

and therefore let me tell you , I have <paren> which I will shew to you
<$$paren> an <font> artificial Minnow <$$font> , that will catch a Trout
as well as an <font> artificial Flie <$$font> ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,247.177

and it was made by a handsom Woman that had <P_248> a fine hand , and a
live <font> Minnow <$$font> lying by her : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.178

<font> the mould or body of the Minnow was cloth , and wrought upon or
over it thus with a needle : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.179

the back of it with very sad French green silk , and paler green silk
towards the belly , shadowed as perfectly as you can imagine , just as
you see a Minnow ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.180

the belly was wrought also with a needle , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.181

and it was a part of it white silk , and another part of it with silver
thred ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.182

the tail and fins were of a quill , which was shaven thin ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.183

the eyes were of two little black beads , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.184

and the head was so shadowed , and all of it so curiously wrought , and
so exactly dissembled , that it would beguile any sharpe_sighted Trout
in a swift stream . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.185

And this Minnow I will now shew you , <paren> look here it is <$$paren>
and if you like it , lend it you , to have two or three made by it ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.186

for they be easily carryed about an Angler , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.187

and be of excellent use ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.188

for note , that a large Trout will come as fiercely at a Minnow , as the
highest mettled Hawk doth seize on a Partridg , or a Grey-hound on a
Hare . <$$font> WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.189

I have been told , that 160 <font> Minnows <$$font> have been found in a
<font> Trouts <$$font> belly ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.190

either the <font> Trout <$$font> had devoured so many ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.191

or the Miller that gave it a friend of mine had forced them down his
throat after he had taken him . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.192

Now for <font> Flies <$$font> , which is the third bait wherewith <font>
Trouts <$$font> are usually taken . You are to know , that there are so
many sorts of Flies as there be of Fruits : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.193

I will name you but some of them , as the <font> dun-flie <$$font> , the
<font> stone-flie <$$font> , the <font> red-flie <$$font> , the <font>
moor-flie <$$font> , the <font> tawny-flie <$$font> , the <font>
shell-flie <$$font> , the <font> cloudy <$$font> , or <font>
blackish-flie <$$font> , the <font> flag-flie <$$font> , the <font>
vine-flie <$$font> : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.194

there be of <font> flies , Caterpillars <$$font> , and <font>
Canker-flies <$$font> , and <font> Bear-flies <$$font> , and indeed too
many either for me to name or for you to remember :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.195

and their breeding is so various and wonderful , that I might easily
amaze my self , and tire you in a relation of them .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.196

And yet I will exercise your promised patience by saying a little of the
<font> Caterpillar <$$font> or the <font> Palmer-flie <$$font> or <font>
worm <$$font> , that by them you may guess what a work it were in a
Discourse but to run over those very many <font> flies , worms <$$font>
and little living creatures with which the Sun and Summer adorn and
beautifie the River banks and Meadows ; both for the recreation and
contemplation of us Anglers , pleasures which <paren> I think <$$paren>
I my self enjoy more than any other man that is not of my profession .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,248.197

<P_249>

<font> Pliny <$$font> holds an opinion , that many have their birth or
being from a dew that in the Spring falls upon the leaves of trees ; and
that some kinds of them are from a dew left upon herbs or flowers ; and
others from a dew left upon Coleworts or Cabbages : All which kinds of
dews being thickned and condensed , are by the Suns generative heat most
of them hatch'd , and in three days made living creatures ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.199

and these of several shapes and colours ; some being hard and tough ,
some smooth and soft ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.200

some are horned in their head , some in their tail ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.201

some have none : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.202

some have hair , some none : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.203

some have sixteen feet , some less , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.204

and some have none , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.205

but <paren> as our <font> Topsel <$$font> hath with great diligence
observed <$$paren> those which have none , move upon the earth or upon
broad leaves , their motion being not unlike to the waves of the Sea .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.206

Some of them he also observes to be bred of the Eggs of other
Caterpillars , and that those in their time turn to be <font>
Butter-flies <$$font> : and again , that their Eggs turn the following
year to be <font> Caterpillars <$$font> . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.207

And some affirm , that every plant has his particular flie or
Caterpillar , which it breeds and feeds . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.208

I have seen , and may therefore affirm it , a green Caterpillar , or
worm , as big as a small Peascod , which had fourteen legs , eight on
the belly , four under the neck , and two near the tail .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.209

It was found on a hedge of Privet , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.210

and was taken thence , and put into a large Box ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.211

and a little branch or two of Privet put to it , on which I saw it feed
as sharply as a dog gnaws a bone : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.212

it lived thus five or six daies , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.213

and thrived , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.214

and changed the colour two or three times , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.215

but by some neglect in the keeper of it , it then dyed
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.216

and did not turn to a flie : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.217

but if it had lived , it had doubtless turned to one of those flies that
some call flies of prey , which those that walk by the Rivers may in
Summer , see fasten on smaller flies , and I think make them their food
. WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.218

And 't@ @is observable , that as there be these <font> flies of prey
<$$font> which be very large , so there be others very little , created
, I think , only to feed them , and bred out of I know not what ; whose
life , they say , Nature intended not to exceed an hour ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.219

and yet that life is thus made shorter by other flies , or accident .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,249.220

<P_250>

'T@ @is endless to tell you what the curious searchers into Natures
productions have observed of these Worms and Flies :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,250.222

But yet I shall tell you what <font> Aldrovandus <$$font> , our <font>
Topsel <$$font> , and others say of the <font> Palmer-worm <$$font> or
<font> Caterpillar <$$font> ; That whereas others content themselves to
feed on particular herbs or leaves , <paren> for most think those very
leaves that gave them life and shape , give them a particular feeding
and nourishment , and that upon them they usually abide <$$paren> yet he
observes , that this is called a <font> pilgrim <$$font> or <font>
palmer-worm <$$font> , for his very wandring life and various food ; not
contenting himself <paren> as others do <$$paren> with any one certain
place for his abode , nor any certain kind of herb or flower for his
feeding ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,250.223

but will boldly and disorderly wander up and down , and not endure to be
kept to a diet , or fixt to a particular place .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,250.224

Nay , the very colours of <font> Caterpillars <$$font> are , as one has
observed , very elegant and beautiful : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,250.225

I shall <paren> for a taste of the rest <$$paren> describe one of them ,
which I will sometime the next month shew you feeding on a Willow-tree ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,250.226

and you shall find him punctually to answer this very description :
<font> His lips and mouth somewhat yellow , his eyes black as Jet , his
forehead purple , his feet and hinder parts green , his tail two_forked
and black , the whole body stained with a kind of red spots which run
along the neck and shoulder-blade , not unlike the form of Saint
<$$font> Andrew's <font> Cross , or the letter <$$font> X , <font> made
thus cross-wise , and a white line drawn down his back to his tail ; all
which add much beauty to his whole body . <$$font>
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,250.227

And it is to me observable , that at a fixed age this <font> Caterpillar
<$$font> gives over to eat , and towards Winter comes to be covered over
with a strange shell or crust called an <font> Aurelia <$$font> , and so
lives a kind of dead life , without eating all the Winter ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,250.228

and <paren> as others of several kinds turn to be several kinds of flies
and vermin the Spring following <$$paren> so this <font> Caterpillar
<$$font> then turns to be a painted <font> Butter-fly
{COM:no_period_in_text} <$$font> WALTON-1676-E3-P2,250.229

Come , come my Scholar , you see the River stops our morning walk ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,250.230

and I will also here stop my discourse , only as we sit down under this
<font> Honey-suckle <$$font> hedg , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,250.231

whilst I look a Line to fit the Rod that our brother <font> Peter
<$$font> hath lent you , I shall for a <P_251> little confirmation of
what I have said , repeat the observation of <font> Du Bartas <$$font> :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,251.232

{COM:verse_omitted}

<font> Venat. <$$font> O my good Master , this morning-walk has been
spent to my great pleasure and wonder : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,251.234

but I pray , when shall I have your direction how to make artificial
flies , like to those that the <font> Trout <$$font> loves best ? and
also how to use them ? WALTON-1676-E3-P2,251.235

<font> Pisc. <$$font> My honest Scholar , it is now past five of the
Clock , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,251.236

we will fish till nine , and then go to breakfast :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,251.237

Go you to yonder <font> Sycamore-tree <$$font> ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,251.238

and hide your Bottle of drink under the hollow root of it ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,251.239

for about that time , and in that place , we will make a brave breakfast
with a piece of powdered Beef , and a Radish or two that I have in my
Fish-bag ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,251.240

we shall , I warrant you , make a good , honest , wholsome , hungry
breakfast , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,251.241

and I will then <P_252> give you direction for the making and using of
your flies : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.242

and in the mean time there is your Rod and Line ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.243

and my advice is , that you fish as you see me do ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.244

and let@ @'s try which can catch the first Fish .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.245

<font> Venat. <$$font> I thank you Master , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.246

I will observe and practice your direction as far as I am able .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.247

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Look you Scholar , you see I have hold of a good
Fish : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.248

I now see it is a Trout ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.249

I pray , put that Net under him , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.250

and touch not my line , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.251

for if you do , then we break all . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.252

Well done Scholar , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.253

I thank you . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.254

Now for another . Trust me , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.255

I have another bite : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.256

come Scholar , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.257

come WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.258

lay down your Rod , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.259

and help me to land this as you did the other .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.260

So , now we shall be sure to have a good dish of Fish for supper .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.261

<font> Venat. <$$font> I am glad of that ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.262

but I have no fortune : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.263

sure , Master , yours is a better Rod , and better tackling .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.264

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Nay , then take mine , and I will fish with yours
. WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.265

Look you , Scholar , I have another ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.266

come , do as you did before . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.267

And now I have a bite at another : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.268

Oh me ! he has broke all ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.269

there 's half a line and a good hook lost . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.270

<font> Venat. <$$font> I and a good <font> Trout <$$font> too .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.271

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Nay , the <font> Trout <$$font> is not lost ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.272

for pray take notice no man can lose what he never had .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.273

<font> Venat. <$$font> Master , I can neither catch with the first nor
second Angle : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.274

I have no fortune . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.275

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Look you , Scholar , I have yet another :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.276

and now having caught three brace of Trouts , I will tell you a short
Tale as we walk towards our breakfast : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.277

<font> A Scholar <paren> a Preacher I should say <$$paren> that was to
preach to procure the approbation of a Parish , that he might be their
Lecturer , had got from his Fellow-pupil the copy of a Sermon that was
first preached with great commendation by him that composed it ;
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.278

and though the borrower of it preached it word for word , as it was at
first , yet it was utterly disliked as it was preached by the second to
his Congregation : which the sermon-borrower complained of to the lender
of it , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,252.279

and was thus answered ; I lent you indeed my <$$font> Fiddle , <font>
but not <P_253> my <$$font> Fiddlestick ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.280

<font> for you are to know , that every one can@ @not make musick with
my words , which are fitted for my own mouth . <$$font>
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.281

And so , my Scholar , you are to know , that as the ill pronunciation or
ill accenting of words in a Sermon spoils it , so the ill carriage of
your line , or not fishing even to a foot in a right place , makes you
lose your labour : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.282

and you are to know , that though you have my <font> Fiddle <$$font> ,
that is , my very Rod and Tacklings with which you see I catch Fish ;
yet you have not my <font> Fiddle-stick <$$font> , that is , you yet
have not skill to know how to carry your hand and line , nor how to
guide it to a right place : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.283

and this must be taught you <paren> for you are to remember I told you ,
Angling is an Art <$$paren> either by practice , or a long observation ,
or both . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.284

But take this for a rule , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.285

when you fish for a Trout with a Worm , let your line have so much , and
not more Lead than will fit the stream in which you fish ; that is to
say ; more in a great troublesom stream than in a smaller that is
quieter ; as near as may be , so much as will sink the bait to the
bottom , and keep it still in motion , and not more .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.286

But now let@ @s say Grace and fall to breakfast :
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.287

what say you , Scholar , to the providence of an old Angler ?
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.288

does not this meat taste well ? WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.289

and was not this place well chosen to eat it ?
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.290

for this Sycamore-tree will shade us from the Suns heat .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.291

<font> Venat. <$$font> All excellent good , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.292

and my stomach excellent good too . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.293

And I now remember and find that true which devout <font> Lessius
<$$font> says , <font> That poor men , and those that fast often , have
much more pleasure in eating than rich men and gluttons , that always
feed before their stomachs are empty of their last meat , and call for
more : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.294

for by that means they rob themselves of that pleasure that hunger
brings to poor men . <$$font> WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.295

And I do seriously approve of that saying of yours , <font> That you had
rather be a civil , well_govern'd , well_grounded , temperate , poor
Angler , than a drunken Lord . <$$font> WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.296

But I hope there is none such ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.297

however I am certain of this , that I have been at many very costly
dinners that have not afforded me half the content that this has done ,
for which I thank God and you . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,253.298

<P_254>

And now good Master , proceed to your promised direction for making and
ordering my Artificial flie . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.300

<font> Pisc. <$$font> My honest Scholar , I will do it ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.301

for it is a debt due unto you by my promise : WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.302

and because you shall not think your self more engaged to me than indeed
you really are , I will freely give you such directions as were lately
given to me by an ingenuous brother of the Angle , an honest man , and a
most excellent <font> Flie-fisher <$$font> . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.303

You are to note , that there are twelve kinds of Artificial made Flies
to Angle with upon the top of the water WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.304

<paren> note by the way , that the fittest season of using these is in a
blustering windy day , when the waters are so troubled that the natural
flie can@ @not be seen , or rest upon them <$$paren> .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.305

The first is the <font> dun-flie <$$font> in <font> March <$$font> ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.306

the body is made of <font> dun wool <$$font> , the wings of the
Partridges feathers . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.307

The second is another <font> dun-Flie <$$font> , the body of <font>
Black wool <$$font> , and the wings of the black Drakes feathers , and
of the feathers under his tail . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.308

The third is the <font> stone-flie <$$font> in <font> April <$$font> ,
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.309

the body is made of <font> black wool <$$font> made yellow under the
wings , and under the tail , and so made with wings of the Drake .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.310

The fourth is the <font> ruddy Flie <$$font> in the beginning of <font>
May <$$font> , the body made of <font> red wool <$$font> wrapt about
with black silk , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.311

and the feathers are the wings of the Drake , with the feathres of a red
Capon also , which hang dangling on his sides next to the tail .
WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.312

The fifth is the <font> yellow <$$font> or <font> greenish-flie <$$font>
<paren> in <font> May <$$font> likewise <$$paren> the body made of
<font> yellow wool <$$font> , and the wings made of the red cocks hackle
or tail . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.313

The sixth is , the <font> black Flie <$$font> in <font> May <$$font>
also , the body made of <font> black wool <$$font> and lapt about with
the herl of a Peacocks tail ; WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.314

the wings are made of the wings of a brown Capon with his blew feathers
in his head . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.315

The seventh is the sad <font> yellow-flie <$$font> in <font> June
<$$font> , WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.316

the body is made of <font> black wool <$$font> , with a yellow list on
either side , and the wings taken off the wings of a Buzzard , bound
with black braked hemp . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.317

The eighth is the <font> moorish flie <$$font> made of the blackish mail
of the Drake . WALTON-1676-E3-P2,254.318
