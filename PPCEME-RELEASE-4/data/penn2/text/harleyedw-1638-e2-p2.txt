To my deare sonne Mr. Edward Harley . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.56

<$$heading>

Good Ned - I haue now reseued your letter by my brother Bray@ @s man .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.58

I giue God thankes that you are recouered from that indispotion you
fellt , HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.59

and thanke you that you did send me word of it ;
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.60

for I desire to knowe howe it is with you in all condistions .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.61

If you are ill , my knoweing of it stire me vp more ernestly to pray for
you . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.62

I beleeue that indispotion you feelt was caused by some violent exersise
: HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.63

if you vse to swinge , let it not be violently ;
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.64

for exersise should be rather to refresch then tyer nature .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.65

You did well to take some bolsome ; HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.66

it is a most sufferen thinge , HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.67

and I purpos , if pleas God , to rwite you the vertues of it .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.68

Deare Ned , if I could as easely conuae meself to you as my letters , I
would not be so longe absent from you ; HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.69

but , sence I must waite for that comfort , I joy in this , that I
asshure meself , your prayers and mine meete dayly at the throne of
grase . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.70

I must nowe tell you , your letter , by the carrier this weake , was
wellcome to me ; HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.71

and your father has reseued his from you , and one from your tutor .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.72

I take it for a greate bllesing , that your worthy tutor giues so good a
testimony of you , and that you esteme him so highely .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.73

I blles the Lord , that has giuen you fauor in his eyes , to seet his
good will vpon you . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.74

It is found experimentally true that conquerores must be as carefull to
keepe what they haue gained as they were to obtain {SIC:obtained} it .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.75

It is alike true , we must be , as carefull and stuedious to keepe good
opinions and affections towords vs as we weare to gaine them ;
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.76

and I hope you will be a good practicinor of that leesson .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.77

Deare Ned , if you would haue any thinge , send me word ;
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.78

or if I thought a coold pye , or such a thinge , would be of any plesure
to you , I would send it you . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.79

But your father says you care not for it , HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.80

and Mrs. Pirson tells me , when her sonne was at Oxford , and shee sent
him such thinges , he prayed her that shee would not .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.81

I thanke you for the Man in the Moune . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.82

I had hard of the booke , but not seene it ; HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.83

by as much as I have looked {SIC:looke} vpon , I find it is some kine to
Donqueshot . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.84

I would willingly haue the French booke you rwite me word of ;
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,13.85

but if it can be had , I desire <P_14> it in French ,
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.86

for I had rather reade any thinge in that tounge then in Inglisch .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.87

I know not sartainely wheather I haue it , tell I see it .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.88

Take it vpon likeing ; HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.89

if I haue it not , I will not return it backe .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.90

Your father was yesterday at Loudlow , wheare the caus was hard betwne
S=r= Gillberd Cornewell and his sisters , HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.91

and it went against S=r= Gilberd Cornewell , to his shame .

HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.94

Smaleman has beueried his wife ; HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.95

and Mrs. Steuenson remaines very ill . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.96

Deare Ned , the Lord in heauen blles you , HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.97

and giue you that principell of gras , which may neuer dye in you , but
that you may growe in gras , and so haue the fauor of your God , which
is better then life , and the fauor of good men , which small number is
worth all the millions of men besides . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.98

To my deare sonne , Mr. Edward Harley . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.107

<$$heading>

Good Need - This night Hall brought me your letter ;
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.109

but he is so perplexed aboute the horses that he seems not to be Hall .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.110

He was apointed by your father and meself to come downe by Oxford , and
to haue rested theare the Seboth ; HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.111

but the spoileing of the horses did so distract him , that he can not
say any thinge of Oxford or Loundoun . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.112

I rwite you worde by the carrier that your father did purpos to send to
you this weake : HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.113

my cosen Prisc sending for his horsess , your father takes that
opertunity to send to your tutor . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.114

I take it for a great mercy of God , that you haue your health ;
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.115

and be you carefull of your selfe : HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.117

the meanes to presarufe health , is a good diet and exersise :
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,14.118

and , as I hope you are not wanteing in your care for your health , so I
hope you are much <P_15> more carefull for your soule , that that better
part of yours may growe in the wayes of knowledg .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,15.119

And in some proportion it is , with the soule as with the body ;
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,15.120

theare must be a good dyet ; HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,15.121

we must feede vpon the worde of God , which when we haue doun we must
not let it lye idell , HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,15.122

but we must be diligent in exersiseing of what we knowe ,
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,15.123

and the more we practes the more we shall knowe .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,15.124

Deare Ned , let nothinge hinder you from performeing constant priuet
duties of prayeing and redeing . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,15.125

Experimentally , I may say that priuet prayer is one of the beest meanes
to keepe the hart cloos with God . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,15.126

O it is a sweet thinge to open our harts to our God , as to a frinde .
HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,15.127

If it had not bine for that I had recours to my God sheure I should haue
fainted before this . HARLEYEDW-1638-E2-P2,15.128
