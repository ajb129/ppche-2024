wearing a Livery , wou'd refuse two_thousand Pound let the Condition be
what it wou'd - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,21.41

if the Wench wou'd promise to dye when the Money were spent , I gad ,
one wou'd marry her , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,21.55

<font> Dor. <$$font> Sprightly , but not wandring ; they seem'd to view
, but never gaz'd on any thing but me - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.110

to tell me that he cou'd with Pride dye at my Feet , tho' he scorn'd
Slavery any where else . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.111

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> The Phyfick works purely -

FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.119

<font> Scrub . <$$font> In the first place I enquir'd who the Gentleman
was ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.120

they told me he was a Stranger , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.121

Secondly , I ask'd what the Gentleman was , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.122

they answer'd FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.123

and said , that they never saw him before . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.124

Thirdly , I enquir'd what Countryman he was , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.125

they reply'd 't@ @was more than they knew . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.126

Fourthly , I demanded whence he came , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.127

their Answer was , they cou'd not tell . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.128

And Fifthly , I ask'd whither he went , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.129

and they reply'd they knew nothing of the matter , -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.130

and this is all I cou'd learn . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.131

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> But what do the People say ,

ca@ @n't they guess ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.133

FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.134

some guess he@ @'s a Mountebank , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.135

some say one thing , some another ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.136

FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.137

<font> Dor. <$$font> A Jesuit ! FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.138

why a Jesuit ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.139

<font> Scrub . <$$font> because he keeps his Horses always ready sadled
, FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.140

and his Footman talks French . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.141

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> His Footman ! FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.142

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Ay , he and the Count's Footman were Gabbering
French like two intreaguing Ducks in a Mill-Pond ,

and I believe they talk'd of me , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.144

for they laugh'd consumedly . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.145

<font> Dor. <$$font> What sort of Livery has the Footman ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.146

Cane dangling at his Nuckles , - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.149

he carries his Hands in his Pockets just so - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,23.150

<font> Gib. <$$font> Ay , Sir , you must excuse me , Sir ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,27.303

I understand the World , especially , the Art of Travelling ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,27.304

I do@ @n't care , Sir , for answering Questions directly upon the Road -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,27.305

for I generally ride with a Charge about me .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,27.306

Captain is a good travelling Name , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,27.316

and so I take it ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,27.317

it stops a great many foolish Inquiries that are generally made about
Gentlemen that travel , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,27.318

it gives a Man an Air of something , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,27.319

and makes the Drawers obedient - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,27.320

And thus far I am a Captain , and no farther .

Here - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.420

<font> Arch. <$$font> With all my Heart ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.421

who knows but you and I may come to be better acquainted , eh -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.422

Here@ @'s your Ladies Healths ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.423

you have three , I think , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.424

and to be sure there must be Secrets among 'em .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.425

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Secrets ! FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.426

Ay , Friend ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.427

I wish I had a Friend - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.428

<font> Arch. <$$font> Am not I your Friend ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.429

come , you and I will be sworn Brothers . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.430

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Shall we ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.431

<font> Arch. <$$font> From this Minute . - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.432

Give me a kiss - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.433

And now Brother <font> Scrub <$$font> FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.434

<font> Scrub . <$$font> And now , Brother <font> Martin <$$font> , I
will tell you a Secret that will make your Hair stand on end : -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.435

You must know , that I am consumedly in Love .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.436

<font> Arch. <$$font> That@ @'s a terrible Secret ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.437

that@ @'s the Truth on@ @'t . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.438

<font> Scrub . <$$font> That Jade , Gipsey , that was with us just now
in the Cellar , is the arrantest Whore that ever wore a Petticoat ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.439

and I@ @'m dying for love of her . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.440

<font> Arch. <$$font> Ha , ha , ha Are you in love with her Person , or
her Vertue , Brother <font> Scrub <$$font> ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.441

<font> Scrub . <$$font> I should like Vertue best , because it is more
durable than Beauty ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.442

for Vertue holds good with some Women long , and many a Day after they
have lost it . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.443

<font> Arch. <$$font> In the Country , I grant ye , where no Woman's
Vertue is lost , till a Bastard be found . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.444

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Ay , cou'd I bring her to a Bastard , I shou'd
have her all to my self ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.445

but I dare not put it upon that Lay , for fear of being sent for a
Soldier . - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.446

Pray , Brother , how do you Gentlemen in <font> London <$$font> like
that same Pressing Act ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.447

<font> Arch. <$$font> Very ill , Brother <font> Scrub <$$font> ; -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.448

'T@ @is the worst that ever was made for us : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.449

Formerly I remember the good Days , when we cou'd dun our Masters for
our Wages , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,30.450

and if they refused to pay us , we cou'd have a Warrant to carry 'em
{SIC:carry'em} before a <P_31> Justice ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.451

but now if we talk of eating , they have a Warrant for us ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.452

and carry us before three Justices . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.453

<font> Scrub . <$$font> And to be sure we go , if we talk of eating ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.454

for the Justices wo@ @n't give their own Servants a bad Example .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.455

Now this is my Misfortune - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.456

I dare not speak in the House , while that jade <font> Gipsey <$$font>
dings about like a Fury - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.457

Once I had the better end of the Staff . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.458

<font> Arch. <$$font> And how comes the Change now ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.459

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Why , the Mother of all this Mischief is a
Priest . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.460

<font> Arch. <$$font> A Priest ! FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.461

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Ay , a damn'd Son of a Whore of <font> Babylon
<$$font> , that came over hither to say Grace to the <font> French
<$$font> Officers , and eat up our Provisions -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.462

There@ @'s not a Day goes over his Head with_out Dinner or Supper in
this House . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.463

<font> Arch. <$$font> How came he so familiar in the Family ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.464

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Because he speaks <font> English <$$font> as if
he had liv'd here all his Life ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.465

and tells Lies as if he had been a Traveller from his Cradle .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.466

<font> Arch. <$$font> And this Priest , I@ @'m afraid has converted the
Affections of your <font> Gipsey <$$font> . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.467

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Converted ! ay , and perverted , my dear
Friend : - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.468

For I@ @'m afraid he has made her a Whore and a Papist . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.469

But this is not all ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.470

there@ @'s the <font> French <$$font> Count and Mrs. <font> Sullen
<$$font> , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.471

they@ @'re in the Confederacy , and for some private Ends of their own
to be sure . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.472

<font> Arch. <$$font> A very hopeful Family yours , Brother <font>
Scrub <$$font> ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.473

I suppose the Maiden Lady has her Lover too .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.474

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Not that I know ; - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.475

She@ @'s the best on 'em , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.476

that@ @'s the Truth on@ @'t : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.477

But they take care to prevent my Curiosity , by giving me so much
Business , that I@ @'m a perfect Slave . - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.478

What d'@ @ye think is my Place in this Family ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.479

<font> Arch. <$$font> Butler , I suppose . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.480

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Ah , Lord help you - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.481

I@ @'ll tell you - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.482

Of a <font> Monday <$$font> , I drive the Coach ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.483

of a <font> Tuesday <$$font> , I drive the Plough ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.484

on <font> Wednesday <$$font> , I follow the Hounds ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.485

a <font> Thursday <$$font> , I dun the Tenants ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.486

on <font> Fryday <$$font> , I go to Market ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.487

on <font> Saturday <$$font> , I draw Warrants ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.488

and a <font> Sunday <$$font> I draw Beer . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.489

<font> Arch. <$$font> Ha , ha , ha ! FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.490

if variety be a Pleasure in Life , you have enough on@ @'t , my dear
Brother - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.491

But what Ladies are those ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.492

<font> Scrub {SIC:Arch.} <$$font> Ours , ours ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.493

that upon the right Hand is Mrs. <font> Sullen <$$font> ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.494

and the other is Mrs. <font> Dorinda <$$font> . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.495

Do@ @n't mind 'em , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.496

sit still , Man - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,31.497

<P_32>

<font> Enter <$$font> Mrs. Sullen , and <font> Dorinda . <$$font>
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.499

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> I have heard my Brother talk of my Lord
<font> Aimwell <$$font> , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.500

but they say that his Brother is the finer Gentleman .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.501

<font> Dor. <$$font> That@ @'s impossible , Sister .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.502

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> He@ @'s vastly rich , but very close , they
say . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.503

<font> Dor. <$$font> No matter for that ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.504

if I can creep into his Heart , I@ @'ll open his Breast , I warrant him
: FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.505

I have heard say , that People may be guess'd at by the Behaviour of
their Servants ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.506

I cou'd wish we might talk to that Fellow . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.507

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> So do I ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.508

for , I think he@ @'s a very pretty Fellow : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.509

Come this way , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.510

I@ @'ll throw out a Lure for him presently . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.511

<paren> They walk a turn towards the opposite side of the Stage ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.512

Mrs. <font> Sullen <$$font> drops her Glove ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.513

<font> Archer <$$font> runs , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.514

takes it up , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.515

and gives it to her . <$$paren> FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.516

<font> Arch. <$$font> Corn , Wine , and Oil , indeed -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.517

But , I think , the Wife has the greatest plenty of Flesh and Blood ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.518

she should be my Choice - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.519

Ah , a , say you so Madam - Your Ladyship's Glove .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.520

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> O , Sir , I thank you -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.521

what a handsom Bow the Fellow has ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.522

<font> Dor. <$$font> Bow ! FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.523

why I have known several Footmen come down from <font> London <$$font>
set up here for Dancing-Masters , and carry off the best Fortunes in the
Country . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.524

<font> Arch. <$$font> <paren> <font> Aside . <$$font> <$$paren> That
Project , for ought I know , had been better than ours , Brother <font>
Scrub <$$font> - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.525

Why do@ @n't you introduce me . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.526

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Ladies , this is the strange Gentleman's
Servant that you see at Church to Day ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.527

I understood he came from <font> London <$$font> ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.528

and so I invited him to the Cellar , that he might show me the newest
Flourish in whetting my Knives . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.529

<font> Dor. <$$font> And I hope you have made much of him ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.530

<font> Arch. <$$font> O yes , Madam , but the Strength of your
Ladyship's Liquour is a little too potent for the Constitution of your
humble Servant . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.531

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> What , then you do@ @n't usually drink Ale
? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.532

<font> Arch. <$$font> No , Madam , my constant Drink is Tea , or a
little Wine and Water ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.533

't@ @is prescrib'd me by the Physician for a Remedy against the Spleen .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.534

<font> Scrub . <$$font> O la , O la ! - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.535

a Footman have the Spleen . - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.536

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> I thought that Distemper had been only
proper to People of Quality . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,32.537

<P_33>

<font> Arch. <$$font> Madam , like all other Fashions it wears out ,
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.539

and so descends to their Servants ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.540

tho' in a great many of us , I believe it proceeds from some melancholly
Particles in the Blood , occason'd by the Stagnation of Wages .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.541

<font> Dor. <$$font> How affectedly the Fellow talks -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.542

How long , pray , have you serv'd your present Master ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.543

<font> Arch. <$$font> Not long ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.544

my Life has been mostly spent in the Service of the Ladies .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.545

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> And pray , which Service do you like best ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.546

<font> Arch. <$$font> Madam , the Ladies pay best ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.547

the Honour of serving there is sufficient Wages ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.548

there is a Charm in their looks that delivers a Pleasure with their
Commands , and gives our Duty the Wings of Inclination .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.549

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> That Flight was above the pitch of a Livery
; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.550

and , Sir , wou'd not you be satisfied to serve a Lady again ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.551

<font> Arch. <$$font> As a Groom of the Chamber , Madam , but not as a
Footman . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.552

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> I suppose you serv'd as Footman before .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.553

<font> Arch. <$$font> For that Reason I wou'd not serve in that Post
again ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.554

for my Memory is too weak for the load of Messages that the Ladies lay
upon their Servants in <font> London <$$font> ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.555

my Lady <font> Howd'ye <$$font> , the last Mistress I serv'd call'd me
up one Morning , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.556

and told me , <font> Martin <$$font> , go to my Lady <font> Allnight
<$$font> with my humble Service ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.557

tell her I was to wait on her Ladyship yesterday , and left word with
Mrs. <font> Rebecca <$$font> , that the Preliminaries of the Affair she
knows of , are stopt till we know the concurrence of the Person that I
know of , for which there are Circumstances wanting which we shall
accommodate at the old Place ; but that in the mean time there is a
Person about her Ladyship , that from several Hints and Surmises , was
accessary at a certain time to the disappointments that naturally attend
things , that to her knowledge are of more Importance .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.558

Mrs. <font> Sull. Dor. <$$font> Ha , ha , ha !
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.559

where are you going , Sir ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.560

<font> Arch. <$$font> Why , I ha@ @n't half done . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.561

The whole Howd'ye was about half an Hour long ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.562

so I hapned to misplace two Syllables , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.563

and was turn'd off , and render'd incapable - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.564

<font> Dor. <$$font> The pleasantest Fellow , Sister , I ever saw . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.565

But , Friend , if your Master be marry'd , - I presume you still serve a
Lady . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,33.566

<P_34>

<font> Arch. <$$font> No , Madam , I take care never to come into a
marry'd Family ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.568

the Commands of the Master and Mistress are always so contrary , that@
@'t@ @is impossible to please both . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.569

<font> Dor. <$$font> There@ @'s a main point gain'd . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.570

My Lord is not marry'd , I find . <paren> <font> Aside . <$$font>
<$$paren> FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.571

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> But , I wonder , Friend , that in so many
good Services , you had not a better Provision made for you .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.572

<font> Arch. <$$font> I do@ @n't know how , Madam . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.573

I had a Lieutenancy offer'd mee three or four Times ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.574

but that is not Bread , Madam - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.575

I live much better as I do . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.576

<font> Scrub . <$$font> Madam , he sings rarely . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.577

I was thought to do pretty well here in the Country till he came ;
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.578

but alack a day , I@ @'m nothing to my Brother <font> Martin <$$font> .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.579

<font> Dor. <$$font> Does he ? FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.580

Pray , Sir , will you oblige us with a Song ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.581

<font> Arch. <$$font> Are you for Passion , or Humour ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.582

<font> Scrub . <$$font> O le ! FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.583

he has the purer Ballad about a Triflle - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.584

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> A Trifle ! FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.585

pray , Sir , let@ @'s have it . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.586

<font> Arch. <$$font> I@ @'m asham'd to offer you a Trifle , Madam :
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.587

But since you command me - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.588

<font> Sings to the Tune of Sir <$$font> Simon <font> the King <$$font>
{COM:song_omitted} FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.589

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Very well , Sir , we@ @'re obliged to you -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.590

Something for a pair of Gloves . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.591

Offering him Money . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.592

<font> Arch. <$$font> I humbly beg leave to be excused :
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.593

My Master , Madam , pays me ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.594

nor dare I take Money from any other Hand without injuring his Honour ,
and disobeying his Commands . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.595

<font> Exit . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.596

Dor. <$$font> This is surprising : FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.597

Did you ever see so pretty a well_bred Fellow ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.598

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> The Devil take him for wearing that Livery
. FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.599

<font> Dor. <$$font> I fancy , Sister , he may be some Gentleman , a
Friend of my Lords , that his Lordship has pitch'd upon for his Courage
, Fidelity , and Discretion to bear him Company in this Dress , and who
, ten to one was his Second too . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.600

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> It is so , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.601

it must be so , FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.602

and it shall be so : - FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.603

For I like him . FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.604

<font> Dor. <$$font> What ! better than the Count ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.605

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> The Count happen'd to be the most agreeable
Man upon the Place ; FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.606

and so I chose him to serve me in my Design upon my Husband . -
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.607

But I shou'd like this Fellow better in a Design upon my self .
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,34.608

<P_35>

<font> Dor. <$$font> But now , Sister , for an Interview with this Lord
, and this Gentleman ; how shall we bring that about ?
FARQUHAR-1707-E3-P2,35.610
