And it came to passe in the fourtieth yeere , in the eleuenth moneth ,
on the first <font> day <$$font> of the moneth , that Moses spake vnto
the children of Israel , according vnto all that the Lord had giuen him
in commandement vnto them : 4 After hee had slaine Sihon the King of the
Amorites , which dwelt in Heshbon , and Og the King of Bashan , which
dwelt at Astaroth , in Edrei . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.13

5 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.14

On this side Iordane , in the land of Moab , began Moses to declare this
law , saying , 6 The Lord our God spake vnto vs in Horeb , saying , Ye
haue dwelt long ynough in this mount : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.15

7 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.16

Turne you , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.17

and take your iourney , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.18

and goe to the mount of the Amorites , and vnto all <font> the places
<$$font> nigh thereunto , in the plaine , in the hills , and in the vale

, and vnto Lebanon , vnto the great riuer , the riuer Euphrates .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.19

8 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.20

Behold , I haue set the land before you : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.21

Goe in , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.22

and possesse the land , which the Lord sware vnto your fathers , Abraham
, Isaac , and Iacob , to giue vnto them , and to their seed after them .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.23

9 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.24

And I spake vnto you at that time , saying , I am not able to beare you
my selfe alone : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.25

l0 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.26

The Lord your God hath multiplied you , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.27

and beholde , you are this day as the starres of heauen for multitude .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.28

<paren> The Lord God of your fathers make you a_thousand times so many

and blesse you as he hath promised you . <$$paren>
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.31

12 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.32

How can I my selfe alone beare your cumbrance , and your burden , and
your strife ? AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.33

13 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.34

Take ye wise men , and vnderstanding , and knowen among your tribes ,
and I will make them rulers ouer you . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.35

14 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.36

And ye answered me , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.37

and saide , The thing which thou hast spoken , is good <font> for vs
<$$font> to doe . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.38

15 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.39

So I tooke the chiefe of your tribes , wise men , and knowen ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.40

and made them heads ouer you , captaines ouer thousands , and captaines
ouer hundreds , and captaines ouer fifties , and captaines ouer tennes ,
and officers among your tribes . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.41

16 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.42

And I charged your Iudges at that time , saying , Heare <font> the
causes <$$font> betweene your brethren , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.43

and iudge righteously betweene euery man and his brother , & the
stranger <font> that is <$$font> with him . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.44

17 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.45

Ye shall not respect persons in iudgement , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.46

<font> but <$$font> you shall heare the small as@ @well as the great :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.47

you shall not bee afraid of the face of man , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.48

for the iudgment is Gods : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.49

and the cause that is too hard for you , bring it vnto me , and I will
heare it . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.50

18 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.51

And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should doe .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.52

19 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.53

And when wee departed from Horeb , we went through all that great and
terrible wildernes , which you saw by the way of the mountaine of the
Amorites , as the Lord our God commanded vs : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.54

and wee came to Kadesh Barnea . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,1D.55

<P_1,20D>

20 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.57

And I said vnto you , Ye are come vnto the mountaine of the Amorites ,
which the Lord our God doth giue vnto vs . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.58

21 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.59

Behold , the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.60

Goe vp , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.61

<font> and <$$font> possesse <font> it , <$$font> as the Lord God of thy
fathers hath said vnto thee : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.62

Feare not , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.63

neither be discouraged . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.64

22 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.65

And ye came neere vnto mee euery one of you ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.66

and said , We will send men before vs , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.67

and they shall search vs out the land , and bring vs word againe , what
way we must goe vp , and into what cities we shall come .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.68

23 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.69

And the saying pleased mee well : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.70

and I tooke twelue men of you , one of a tribe .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.71

24 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.72

And they turned AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.73

and went vp to the mountaine , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.74

and came vnto the alley of Eshcol , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.75

and searched it out . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.76

25 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.77

And they tooke of the fruit of the land in their handes ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.78

and brought it downe unto vs , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.79

and brought vs worde againe , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.80

and said , It is a good lande which the Lord our God doeth giue vs .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.81

26 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.82

Notwithstanding , ye would not goe vp , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.83

but rebelled against the commandement of the Lord your God .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.84

27 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.85

And ye murmured in your tents AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.86

and said , Because the Lord hated vs , he hath brought vs forth out of
the land of Egypt , to deliuer vs into the hand of the Amorites , to
destroy vs : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.87

28 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.88

Whither shall wee goe vp ? AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.89

our brethren haue discouraged our heart , saying , The people is greater
and taller then we , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.90

the cities are great , and walled vp to heauen ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.91

and moreouer we haue seene the sonnes of the Anakims there .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.92

29 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.93

Then I said vnto you , Dread not , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.94

neither be afraid of them . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.95

30 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.96

The Lord your God which goeth before you , he shall fight for you ,
according to all that hee did for you in Egypt before your eyes :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.97

31 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.98

And in the wildernes , where thou hast seene how that the Lord thy God
bare thee , as a man doth beare his sonne , in all the way that ye went
, vntil ye came into this place . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.99

32 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.100

Yet in this thing ye did not beleeue the Lord your God . 33 Who went in
the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents in , in
fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should goe , and in a cloud
by day . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.101

34 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.102

And the Lord heard the voice of your words ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.103

and was wroth , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.104

and sware , saying , 35 Surely there shall not one of these men of this
euill generation see that good land , which I sware to giue vnto your
fathers : 36 Saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.105

he shall see it , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.106

and to him will I giue the land that he hath troden vpon , and to his
children , because hee hath wholly followed the Lord .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.107

37 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.108

Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes , saying , Thou also
shalt not goe in thither . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.109

38 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.110

<font> But <$$font> Ioshua the sonne of Nun , which standeth before thee
, he shall goe in thither . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.111

Encourage him : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.112

for he shall cause Israel to inherite it . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.113

39 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.114

Moreouer , your litle ones , which ye said should be a pray , and your
children , which in that day had no knowledge betweene good and euil ,
they shall goe in thither ; AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.115

and vnto them will I giue it , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.116

and they shall possesse it . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,20D.117

<P_1,40D>

40 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.119

But as for you , turne ye , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.120

and take your iourney into the wildernesse , by the way of the Red sea .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.121

41 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.122

Then ye answered , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.123

and said vnto mee , Wee haue sinned against the Lord ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.124

we will goe vp and fight , according to all that the Lord our God
commanded vs . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.125

And when ye had girded on euery man his weapons of warre , yee were
ready to goe vp into the hill . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.126

42 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.127

And the Lord said vnto me , Say vnto them , Goe not vp ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.128

neither fight , for I am not among you : least ye be smitten before your
enemies . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.129

43 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.130

So I spake vnto you , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.131

and you would not heare , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.132

but rebelled against the commandement of the Lord ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.133

and went presumptuously vp into the hill . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.134

44 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.135

And the Amorites which dwelt in that mountaine , came out against you ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.136

and chased you , as Bees doe , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.137

and destroyed you in Seir , euen vnto Hormah .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.138

45 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.139

And ye returned AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.140

and wept before the Lord ; AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.141

but the Lord would not hearken to your voyce , nor giue eare vnto you .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.142

46 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,1,40D.143

So yee abode in Kadesh many dayes , according vnto the dayes that ye

1 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.150

Then we turned , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.151

and tooke our iourney into the wildernesse , by the way of the Red sea ,
as the Lord spake vnto mee : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.152

and wee compassed mount Seir many dayes . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.153

2 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.154

And the Lord spake vnto me , saying , 3 Yee haue compassed this
mountaine long enough : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.155

turne you Northward . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.156

4 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.157

And commaund thou the people , saying , Ye are to passe through the
coast of your brethren the children of Esau , which dwell in Seir , and
they shall be afraid of you : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.158

take ye good heed vnto your selues therefore .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.159

5 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.160

Meddle not with them , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.161

for I will not giue you of their land , no not so much as a foote
breadth , because I haue giuen mount Seir vnto Esau for possession .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.162

6 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.163

Ye shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.164

and yee shall also buy water of them for money , that yee may drinke .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.165

7 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.166

For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee , in all the workes of thy hand :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.167

hee knoweth thy walking thorow this great wildernesse :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.168

these fourtie yeres the Lord thy God hath bene with thee ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.169

thou hast lacked nothing . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.170

8 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.171

And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau , which
dwelt in Seir , thorow the way of the plaine from Elath , and from
Ezion-Gaber , wee turned AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.172

and passed by the way of the wildernesse of Moab .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.173

9 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.174

And the Lord said vnto mee , Distresse not the Moabites ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.175

neither contend with them in battell : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.176

for I wil not giue thee of their land for a possession , because I haue
giuen Ar vnto the children of Lot for a possession .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.177

10 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.178

The Emims dwelt therein in times past , a people great , and many , and
tall , as the Anakims . 11 Which also were accounted giants , as the
Anakims , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.179

but the Moabites call them Emims . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.180

12 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.181

The Horims also dwelt in Seir before time , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.182

but the children of Esau succeeded them when they had destroyed them
from before them , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.183

& dwelt in their stead , as Israel did vnto the land of his possession ,
which the Lord gaue vnto them . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.184

13 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.185

Now rise vp , <font> said I <$$font> , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.186

and get you ouer the brooke Zered : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.187

and we went ouer the brooke Zered . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.188

14 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.189

And the space in which we came from Kadesh Barnea , vntill we were come
ouer the brooke Zered , was thirtie_and_eight yeeres ; vntill all the
generation of the men of warre were wasted out from among the hoste , as
the Lord sware vnto them . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.190

15 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.191

For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them , to destroy them from
among the hoste , vntill they were consumed .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.192

16 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.193

So it came to passe , when all the men of warre were consumed and dead
from among the people , 17 That the Lord spake vnto me , saying , 18
Thou art to passe ouer thorow Ar , the coast of Moab , this day .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.194

19 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.195

And when thou commest nigh ouer against the children of Ammon ,
distresse them not , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.196

nor meddle with them : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.197

for I will not giue thee of the lande of the children of Ammon any
possession , because I haue giuen it vnto the children of Lot for a
possession : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,1D.198

<P_2,20D>

20 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.200

<paren> That also was accounted a land of Giants :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.201

giants dwelt therein in old time , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.202

and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.203

21 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.204

A people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.205

but the Lord destroyed them before them , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.206

and they succeeded them AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.207

& dwelt in their stead : <$$paren> AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.208

22 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.209

As he did to the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir , when he
destroyed the Horims from before them , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.210

and they succeeded them , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.211

and dwelt in their stead euen vnto this day .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.212

23 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.213

And the Auims which dwelt in Hazerim , euen vnto Azzah , the Caphtorims
which came foorth out of Caphtor destroyed them ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.214

and dwelt in their stead . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.215

24 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.216

Rise ye vp , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.217

take your iourney , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.218

Behold , I haue giuen into thy hand Sihon the Amorite king of Heshbon ,

and contend with him in battell . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.222

25 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.223

This day will I begin to put the dread of thee , and the feare of thee
vpon the nations , <font> that are <$$font> vnder the whole heauen , who
shall heare report of thee , and shall tremble , and be in anguish
because of thee . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.224

26 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.225

And I sent messengers out of the wildernesse of Kedemoth , vnto Sihon
king of Heshbon , with wordes of peace , saying , 27 Let me passe
through thy land : I will goe along by the high way ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.226

I will neither turne vnto the right hand , nor to the left .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.227

28 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.228

Thou shalt sell me meat for money , that I may eate , and give me water
for money that I may drinke : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.229

Only I will passe through on my feet : 29 As the children of Esau which
dwell in Seir , and the Moabites which dwell in Ar , did vnto me ,
vntill I shall passe ouer Iordan , into the land which the Lord our God
giueth vs . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.230

30 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.231

But Sihon King of Heshbon would not let vs passe by him :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.232

for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.233

and made his heart obstinate , that hee might deliuer him into thy hand
, as <font> appeareth <$$font> this day . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.234

31 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.235

And the Lord said vnto mee , Behold , I haue begun to give Sihon and his

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.237

32 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.238

Then Sihon came out against vs , he & all his people to fight at Iahaz .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.239

33 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.240

And the Lord our God deliuered him before vs ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.241

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.242

34 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.243

And we tooke all his cities at that time , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,2,20D.244

and vtterly destroyed the men , and the women , and the litle ones of

From Aroer , which <font> is <$$font> by the brinke of the riuer of

1 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.259

Then we turned , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.260

and went vp the way to Bashan : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.261

and Og the King of Bashan came out against vs , hee , and all his people
to battell at Edrei . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.262

2 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.263

And the Lord said vnto mee , Feare him not : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.264

for I will deliuer him , and all his people , and his land into thy hand
, AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.265

and thou shalt doe vnto him as thou didst vnto Sihon king of the
Amorites , which dwelt at Heshbon . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.266

3 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.267

So the Lord our God deliuered into our hands Og also the King of Bashan
, and all his people : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.268

and wee smote him vntill none was left to him remayning .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.269

4 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.270

And we tooke all his cities at that time , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.271

there was not a citie which wee tooke not from them ;
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.272

threescore cities , all the region of Argob , the kingdome of Og in
Bashan . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.273

5 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.274

All these cities were fenced with high walles , gates and barres ,
beside vnwalled townes a great many . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.275

6 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.276

And we vtterly destroyed them , as we did vnto Sihon King of Heshbon ,
vtterly destroying the men , women , and children of euery citie .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.277

7 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.278

But all the cattell , and the spoyle of the cities , we tooke for a pray
to our selues . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.279

8 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.280

And we tooke at that time out of the hand of the two Kings of the
Amorites , the land that was on this side Iordan , from the riuer of
Arnon , vnto mount Hermon : 9 <paren> <font> Which <$$font> Hermon the
Sidonians call Syrion : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.281

and the Amorites call it Shenir . <$$paren> AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.282

All the cities of the plaine , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , vnto
Salchah , and Edrei , cities of the kingdome of Og in Bashan .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.284

11 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.285

For onely Og King of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants ;
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.286

behold , his bedsted was a bedsted of yron : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.287

is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon ?
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.288

Nine cubites was the length thereof , and foure cubites the breadth of
it , after the cubite of a man . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.289

12 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.290

And this land <font> which <$$font> we possessed at that time , from
Aroer which <font> is <$$font> by the riuer Arnon , and halfe mount

the Gadites . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.291

13 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.292

And the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , <font> being <$$font> the
kingdome of Og , gave I vnto the halfe tribe of Manasseh : All the
region of Argob with all Bashan , which was called the land of Giants .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.293

14 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.294

Iair the son of Manasseh tooke all the countrey of Argob , unto the
coastes of Geshuri , and Maachathi ; AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.295

and called them after his owne name , Bashan Hauoth Iair , vnto this day

15 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.297

And I gaue Gilead vnto Machir . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.298

16 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.299

And vnto the Reubenites , and vnto the Gadites , I gaue from Gilead ,
euen vnto the riuer Arnon , halfe the valley , and the border , euen
vnto the riuer Iabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon :
17 The plaine also , and Iordan , and the coast <font> thereof <$$font>

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.300

And I commanded you at that time , saying , The Lord your God hath giuen

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.303

19 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,1D.304

But your wiues , and your little ones , and your cattell <paren> for I
know that ye haue much cattel <$$paren> shall abide in your cities ,
which I haue giuen you : <P_3,20D> 20 Vntill the Lord haue giuen rest

giuen you . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.306

21 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.307

And I commanded Ioshua at that time , saying , Thine eyes haue seene all
that the Lord your God hath done vnto these two Kings :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.308

so shal the Lord doe vnto all the kingdomes whither thou passest .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.309

22 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.310

Ye shall not feare them : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.311

for the Lord your God , he shal fight for you .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.312

23 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.313

And I besought the Lord at that time , saying , 24 O Lord God , thou
hast begun to shew thy seruant thy greatnesse , and thy mighty hand :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.314

for what God is there in heauen , or in earth , that can do according to

Iordan , that goodly mountaine and Lebanon .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.317

26 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.318

But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.319

and would not heare mee : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.320

and the Lord said vnto me , Let it suffice thee ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.321

speake no more vnto me of this matter . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.322

27 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.323

Get thee vp into the top of Pisgah , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.324

and lift vp thine eyes Westward , and Northward , and Southward , and
Eastward , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.325

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.326

for thou shalt not goe ouer this Iordan . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.327

28 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.328

But charge Ioshua , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.329

and encourage him , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.330

and strengthen him : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.331

for hee shall goe ouer before this people , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.332

and he shall cause them to inherite the land which thou shalt see .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,3,20D.333

When I was gone vp into the mount , to receiue the Tables of stone ,

And the Lord deliuered vnto me two Tables of stone , written with the

And the Lord said vnto mee , Arise , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.724

get thee downe quickly from hence ; AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.725

for thy people which thou hast brought foorth out of Egypt , haue

they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ;
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.727

they haue made them a molten image . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.728

13 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.729

Furthermore , the Lord spake vnto me , saying , I haue seene this people

and behold , it is a stifnecked people . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.731

and came downe from the mount , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.736

and the mount burned with fire : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.737

and the two Tables of the Couenant were in my two hands .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.738

16 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.739

And I looked , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.740

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.741

<font> and <$$font> haue made you a molten calfe :

17 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.744

And I tooke the two Tables , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.745

and brake them before your eyes . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.747

18 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.748

And I fell downe before the Lord , as at the first , fortie dayes and
fortie nights , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,1D.749

I did neither eate bread nor drinke water , because of all your sinnes

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.756

And I prayed for Aaron also the same time .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.757

21 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.758

And I tooke your sinne , the calfe which ye had made ,
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.759

and burnt it with fire , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.760

and stamped it , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.761

<font> and <$$font> ground it very small , euen vntill it was as small
as dust : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.762

22 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.764

And at Taberah , and at Massah , and at Kibroth-Hattaauah , ye prouoked
the Lord to wrath . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.765

23 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.766

Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnes , saying , Goe vp and
possesse the land which I haue giuen you , then you rebelled against the
commandement of the Lord your God , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.767

and ye beleeued him not , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.768

nor hearkened to his voyce . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.769

Thus I fell downe before the Lord fourtie dayes , and fourtie nights ,

I prayed therefore vnto the Lord , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,9,20D.775

and the Lord gaue them vnto me . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,10,1D.796

And the children of Israel tooke their iourney from Beeroth , of the

there Aaron died , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,10,1D.804

and there he was buried , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,10,1D.805

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,10,1D.806

From thence they iourneyed vnto Gudgodah , and from Gudgodah to Iotbath
, a land of riuers of waters . AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,10,1D.808

At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Leui , to beare the Arke of
the Couenant of the Lord , to stand before the Lord , to minister vnto
him , and to blesse in his Name , vnto this day . 9 Wherefore Leui hath
no part nor inheritance with his brethren : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,10,1D.810

Therefore thou shalt loue the Lord thy God , and keepe his charge , and

AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,1D.854

And know you this day : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,1D.856

for <font> I speake <$$font> not with your children which haue not
knowen , and which haue not seene the chastisement of the Lord your God
, his greatnesse , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arme , 2 And
his miracles , and his actes , which he did in the midst of Egypt , vnto
Pharaoh the King of Egypt , and vnto all his land , 4 And what hee did
vnto the army of Egypt , vnto their horses , and to their charets , how
he made the water of the Red sea to ouerflow them as they pursued after
you , and <font> how <$$font> the Lord hath destroyed them vnto this day
, 5 And what hee did vnto you in the wildernesse , vntill yee came into
this place , 6 And what he did vnto Dathan , and Abiram , the sonnes of
Eliab the sonne of Reuben : how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed
them vp , and their housholds , and their tents , and all the substance
that was {SIC:twas} in their possession in the middest of all Israel .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,1D.857

But your eyes haue seene all the great acts of the Lord , which he did .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,1D.859

Therefore shall yee keepe all the Commandements which I command you this

ye goe to possesse it : 9 And that yee may prolong <font> your <$$font>
dayes in the lande which the Lord sware vnto your fathers to giue vnto
them , and to their seed , a land that floweth with milke and hony .
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,1D.861

10 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,1D.862

For the land whither thou goest in to possesse it , is not as the lande
of Egypt from whence ye came out , where thou sowedst thy seed , and
wateredst <font> it <$$font> with thy foot , as a garden of herbes :
AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,1D.863

11 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,1D.864

But the lande whither ye goe to possess it , <font> is <$$font> a lande
of hilles and valleys , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,1D.865

<font> and <$$font> drinketh water of the raine of heauen : 12 A lande ,
which the Lord thy God careth for : AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,1D.866

the eyes of the Lord thy God <font> are <$$font> alwayes vpon it , from

And it shall come to passe , if you shall hearken diligently vnto my
Commandements which I command you this day , to loue the Lord your God ,
and to serue him with all your heart , and with all your soule ; 14 That
I will giue <font> you <$$font> the raine of your land in his due season

16 AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,1D.872

Take heede to your selues , that your heart be not deceiued , and ye

then <$$font> the Lords wrath be kindled against you , and hee shut vp
the heauen , that there be no raine , and that the land yeeld not her

And thou shalt write them vpon the doore posts of thine house , and vpon

For if ye shall diligently keepe all these Commaundements which I

these nations from before you , AUTHOLD-1611-E2-P2,11,20D.882

Behold , I set before you this day , a blessing and a curse : 27 A
