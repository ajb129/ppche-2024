That fro~ any pricke to one other , there may be drawen a right line .
As for example . {COM:figure_omitted} RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1R.6

A being the one pricke , and B. the other , you maye drawe betwene them
from the one to the other , that is to say , from A. vnto B , and from
B. to A. RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1R.7

That any right line of measurable length may be drawen forth longer ,
and straight . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1R.8

Example of A.B , which as it is a line of measurable lengthe , so may it
be drawen forth longer , as for example vnto C , {COM:figure_omitted}
and that in true streightenes without crokinge .
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1R.9

That vpon any centre , there may be made a circle of anye qua~titee that
a man wyll . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1R.10

Let the centre be set to A , RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1R.11

{COM:figure_omitted}

what shal hinder a man to drawe a circle about it , of what quantitee
that he lusteth , as you se the forme here : other bygger or lesse , as
it shall lyke him to doo ? RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1R.13

<P_2,B1V>

That all right angles be equall eche to other .
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1V.15

Set for an example A. and B , {COM:figure_omitted} of which two though
A. seme the greater angle to some men of small experience , it
happeneth only bicause that the lines aboute A , are longer the~ the
lines about B , as you may proue by drawing them longer ,
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1V.16

for so shal B. seme the greater angle yf you make his lines longer then
the lines that make the angle A. RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1V.17

And to proue it by demonstration , I say thus .
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1V.18

If any ij. right corners be not equal , then one right corner is
greater then an other , RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1V.19

but that corner which is greater then a right angle , is a blunt corner
<paren> by his definition <$$paren> RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1V.20

so must one corner be both a right corner and a blunt corner also ,
whiche is not possible : RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1V.21

And againe : the lesser right corner must be a sharpe corner , by his
definition , bicause it is lesse then a right angle , which thing is
impossible . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1V.22

Therefore I conclude that all right angles be equall .
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1V.23

Yf one right line do crosse two other right lines , and make ij. inner
corners of one side lesser the~ ij. righte corners , it is certaine ,
that if those two lines be drawen forth right on that side that the
sharpe inner corners be , they wil at le~gth mete togither , and crosse
on an other . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B1V.24

The ij. lines beinge as A.B. and C.D , and the third line crossing
them as dooth heere E.F , making ij inner corners {SIC:cornes} <paren>
as ar G.H. <$$paren> lesser then two right corners ,
{COM:figure_omitted} sith ech of <P_2,B2R> them is lesse then a right
corner , as your eyes maye iudge , then say I , if those ij. lines A.B.
and C.D. be drawen in lengthe on that side that G. and H. are , the
{COM:sic} will at length meet and crosse one an other .
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.25

Two right lines make no platte forme . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.26

A platte forme , as you harde before , hath bothe length and bredthe ,
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.27

and is inclosed with lines as with his boundes ,
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.28

but ij. right lines can@ @not inclose al the bondes of any platte forme
. RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.29

Take for an example firste these two right lines AB. and A.C. whiche
meete togither in A , {COM:figure_omitted} but yet can@ @not be called a
platte forme , bicause there is no bond from B. to C ,
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.30

but if you will drawe a line betwene them twoo , that is frome B. to C
, then will it be a platte forme , that is to say , a triangle ,
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.31

but then are there iij. lines , and not only ij .
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.32

Likewise may you say of D.E. and F.G , {COM:figure_omitted} whiche doo
not {TEXT:missing_"not"}
{COM:"not"_is_required_since_the_lines_de_and_fg_are_parallel_in_the_figure}
make a platte forme , RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.33

nother yet can they make any without helpe of two lines more , whereof
the one must be drawen from D. to F , and the other frome E. to G ,
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.34

and then will it be a longe square . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.35

So then of two right lines can bee made no platte forme .
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.36

But of ij. croked lines be made a platte forme , as you se in the eye
form . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B2R.37

And also of one rightline , & one croked line , maye a platte fourme bee
made , as the semicircle F. doothe sette forth .

for of thys last se~tence many me~ at the first hearing do make a doubt
. RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4R.103

Ther fore as in this example of the circle deuided into su~dry partes
<P_2,B4V> {COM:figure_omitted} it doeth appere that no parte can be so
great as the whole circle , <paren> accordyng to the meanyng of the
eight sentence <$$paren> so yet it is certain , that all those eight
partes together be equall vnto the whole circle .
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4V.104

And this is the meanyng of that common sentence <paren> whiche many vse
, and fewe do rightly understand <$$paren> that is , that <font> All the
partes of any thing are nothing els , but the whole . <$$font> And
contrary waies : <font> The whole is nothing els , but all his partes
taken togither . <$$font> whiche saiynges some haue vnderstand to meane
thus : that all the partes are of the same kind that the whole thyng is
: RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4V.105

but that that meanyng is false , it doth plainly appere by this figure
A.B , {COM:figure_omitted} whose partes A. and B , are triangles , and
the whole figure is a square , RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4V.106

and so they are not of one kind . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4V.107

But and if they applie it to the matter or substance of thinges <paren>
as some do <$$paren> then it is moste false ,
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4V.108

for euery compound thyng is made of partes of diuerse matter and
substance . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4V.109

Take for example a man , a house , a boke , and all other compound
thinges . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4V.110

Some vnderstand it thus , that the partes all together can make none
other forme , but that that the whole doth shewe , whiche is also false
, RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4V.111

for I make fiue_hundred diuerse figures of the partes of some one figure
, as you shall better perceiue in the third boke .
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4V.112

And in the meane seaso~ take for an exa~ple this square figure folowing
A.B.C.D , {COM:figures_on_next_page_omitted} w=ch= is deuided but into
two parts , RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4V.113

the firste , with onely diuerse ioynyng of those two partes .
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,B4V.114

But of this shall I speake more largely in an other place ,

<$$heading>

when two lines are drawen fro~ the endes of anie one line , and meet in

other pointe then the twoo first did . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,C2V.160

<font> Example . <$$font> RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,C2V.161

{COM:figure_omitted}

The first line is A.B , on which I haue erected two other lines A.C ,

possible to draw ij. other lines from A. and B. which shal mete in
one point <paren> as you se A.D. and B.D. mete in D. <$$paren> but
that the match lines shal@ @be vnequal , RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,C2V.163

that is the ij. on the right hand , or the ij. on the lefte hand ,

The example that declared the last theoreme , maye well serue to the

For those ij. theoremes do diffre but in this one pointe , that the
laste theoreme meaneth of triangles , that haue one ground line common
to them both , RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,E2V.413

and this theoreme doth presuppose the grounde lines to bee diuers , but
yet of one length , as A.C.D , and B.E.F , RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,E2V.414

as they are ij. equall triangles approued , by the eighte_and_twentye

now this beeynge true , and considering that they are made towarde one

that is to saye , B.G . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,E3R.427

Therfore doth it folow that the lyke_iamme A.B.G.C. is double to the

A.B.F.E. other F.E.C.G. as you may coniecture by the .xi. conclusion
geometrical . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,E3R.430

And as this Theoreme dothe speake of a triangle and likeiamme that haue
one groundelyne , so is it true also , yf theyr groundelynes be equall ,
though they bee dyuers , so that thei be made betwene one payre of
paralleles . RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,E3R.431

And hereof may you perceaue the reason , why in measuryng the platte of
a triangle , you must multiply the perpendicular lyne by halfe the
grounde lyne , or els the hole grounde lyne by halfe the perpendicular ,
RECORD-1551-E1-P2,2,E3R.432
