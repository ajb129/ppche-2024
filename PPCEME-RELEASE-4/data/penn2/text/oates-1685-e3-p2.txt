<font> Biddolph . <$$font> My Lord , I was in <font> Staffordshire
<$$font> the latter end of <font> August <$$font> and the beginning of
<font> September <$$font> , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.88.299

and I was at Mrs. <font> Crompton <$$font> 's House , which is my Aunt
, the 2d of <font> September <$$font> being <font> Monday <$$font> ,
where I saw Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> , and dined with him that day ;

and after Dinner he went with Mr. <font> Gerrard <$$font> 's Son , who
was to go to School to <font> Boscobel <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.88.301

And I will give your Lordship a particular Circumstance that may satisfy
you that I am not mistaken in the time : OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.88.302

As I came through <font> Northhamptonshire <$$font> that Summer , I was
at my Lord <font> Cullen <$$font> 's , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.88.303

and he desired me to be at a Horse-Race at <font> Newton-Slade <$$font>
, where there is a Plate always run for the first <font> Thursday
<$$font> in <font> September <$$font> , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.88.304

and that Year it was the 5th of <font> September <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.88.305

Now when I dined at my Aunt <font> Crompton <$$font> 's , she would have
had me staid all Night at her House , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.88.306

but I excused myself , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.88.307

to be at the Race , and must needs be there before , to be as good as my
Word to my Lord ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.88.308

and therefore I went away to <font> Pancross <$$font> , and so on my
Journey , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.88.309

otherwise I had staid with my Aunt all Night : OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.88.310

Mrs. <font> Pendrel . <$$font> I was in Court ,

<font> Oates . <$$font> Did she not give Evidence there ?
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.417

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> She was examined , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.418

but she could not be sworn , because she came to testify against the

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Pray , what say you , Mr. <font>
Charles Gifford ? <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.420

Mr. <font> C. Gifford . <$$font> My Lord , I say I saw Mr. <font>
Ireland <$$font> at my Father's House in <font> Black-Ladies <$$font> ,
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.421

and he staid there an Hour and an half , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.422

and went through <font> Chillington <$$font> , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.423

OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.424

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> What Day of the Month was it ?
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.425

Mr. <font> C. Gifford . <$$font> I am morally certain it was the 4th
of <font> September <$$font> , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.426

and so he went to <font> Wolverhampton <$$font> , as I am informed .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.427

He came to our House to see a Lady that was there .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.428

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Lady was it ? -
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.429

Mr. <font> C. Gifford . <$$font> It was one Madam <font> Wells
<$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.430

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Thus , my Lord , we have lodged him the
4th of <font> September <$$font> at <font> Wolverhampton <$$font> , when
Mrs. <font> Harwell <$$font> says , he return'd to her ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.431

and so , my Lord , we have given an Account where he was from the 3d of
<font> August <$$font> to the 14th of <font> September <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.432

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> We have prov'd where he was every Day
in that time , but only the 8th of <font> September <$$font> ,
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.433

and for that we must leave it to the Jury . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.434

We have proved that he came away from Mrs. <font> Harwell <$$font> 's
the 7th , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.435

and he said he was to go to <font> Tixhall <$$font> ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.436

and the 9th he did go from <font> Tixhall <$$font> in Sir <font> John
Southcoat <$$font> 's Company , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.437

and came to <font> London <$$font> the 14th . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.438

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , what say you to it , Mr. <font>
Oates ? <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.439

<font> Oates <$$font> . Has Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> done his
Evidence , my Lord ? OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.440

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> We shall call no more Witnesses , unless
you go about to support your own Credit , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.441

and then we have other Witnesses to call . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.442

<font> Oates . <$$font> I do not value any Witnesses you can bring
against my Credit . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.443

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Well , for the present , we do not
design to call any more Witnesses . - OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.444

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then let us hear what you say to it .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.445

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , here is an Indictment against me ,
which sets forth , that I should swear at Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font>
's Trial , that Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> was in Town the 1st and 2d
of <font> September <$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.446

and it sets forth , that in truth he was not in Town :
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.447

And likewise it sets forth , that I swore at the Trial of the five
Jesuits , that Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> took his leave of me and
others here in Town at his Lodging in <font> Russel-street <$$font> ,
between the 8th and 12th of <font> August : <$$font> whereas the Perjury
there assigned , is this , That he did not take his Leave of me , or any
other Person , betwixt the 8th and 12th of <font> August <$$font> , at
his Lodging in <font> Russel-Street <$$font> .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.448

Now , my Lord , I was not the only Witness of Mr. <font> Ireland
<$$font> 's being in Town in the Month of <font> August <$$font> , nor
the only Witness of his being in Town about that time in <font>
September <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.449

My Lord , my Prosecutors have endeavoured to maintain this Charge
against me thus : OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.450

The first thing they have gone upon , as far as I can remember in the
Indictment , is as to the 1st or 2d of <font> September <$$font> ,
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.451

or rather , they have endeavoured to prove both under one .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.452

Now , in answer to all this Evidence , my Lord , the first thing I shall
offer to your Lordship's Consideration , and the Consideration of the
Jury , is the great Hardship I lie under , after six Years time , to be
put to disprove what the Counsel here have now offered against me .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.453

My Lord , I observe first , that this Indictment , which is now upon
Trial , is founded upon the Trial of <font> Ireland <$$font> , which was
the 17th of <font> December <$$font> 1678 , at the <font> Old-Bailey
<$$font> , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.454

and it is now six Years after that Evidence of mine was delivered .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.455

A second thing is , that the Indictment is found by special Commission ,
as appears by the Indictment itself . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.89.456

Now , I must recommend to the Consideration of your Lordship and this
Jury , why the Prosecution of this pretended Perjury has been delay'd so
long , when it appears by the Evidence which has been produced , that
the Witnesses to prove it were known six Years since , as <P_4.90> much
as they are now ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.457

and there is no colour of Evidence offered , that any new Fact has been
lately discovered which was not then knowne . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.458

There is no Reason , my Lord , that is assigned , or can be assigned for
this Delay , but only that the Hardship might be the greater upon me :
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.459

For now it is difficult , if not impossible for me to maintain the
Evidence I then gave , so many Persons being since dead , or gone beyond
the Seas , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.460

and many things that were fresh then , are now grown out of Memory ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.461

and I beg your Favour to insist upon this , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.462

and I think it can@ @not be denied me . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.463

If such a Practice as this be admitted , no Witness is safe in giving
his Testimony against any Conspirators whatsoever .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.464

For , my Lord , I must desire leave to offer another thing to your
Consideration , before I speak to the particular Evidence ,
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.465

and that is this ; That here is nothing but a bare Point of Time upon
which this Perjury is assigned ; when the Substance of the Testimony
that I gave at the Trials of Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> and the rest ,
about the Popish Plot , is not assigned as any Perjury at all ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.466

it is only a Circumstance of Time and Place . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.467

And , my Lord , I shall offer this to your further Consideration , that
<font> Ireland <$$font> was convicted for a treasonable Resolution to
murder the late King , and not for being in Town in <font> August
<$$font> or <font> September <$$font> 78 , or elsewhere ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.468

and he was not convicted for his being in his Chamber in <font>
Russel-street <$$font> , and taking his leave there in <font> August
<$$font> , which is one matter of the Perjury now assigned .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.469

Next , my Lord , 't@ @is hard and unreasonable to tie up Witnesses that
come to discover Plots and Conspiracies , to speak positively as to
Circumstance of Time and Place , and every little Punctilio in their
Evidence , to bind them up to such Niceties in the delivery of their
Testimonies , as to Time and Place . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.470

It is usual to speak with latitude as to such kind of things ,
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.471

and 't@ @is probably my Evidence which is now in question , was not that
<font> Ireland <$$font> was the 1st or 2d of <font> September <$$font>
positively here in Town ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.472

but , my Lord , I did <paren> I believe <$$paren> give myself a latitude
, OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.473

and would not confine myself to either the 1st or 2d , 5th , 6th , 7th ,
or 8th ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.474

But my Lord , that he was in <font> September <$$font> there , I am
positive . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.475

I must therefore beg your Lordship's and the Court's Opinion , whether
that Mr. <font> Foster <$$font> did prove that I was positive and
precise to the Days of the 1st and 2d of <font> September <$$font> 78 ?
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.476

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> In my Opinion it is a plain Evidence that
you did swear positively to those two Days ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.477

and you spoke to a Circumstance very material in your Evidence , that
either the first or 2d of <font> September <$$font> you had twenty
shillings of him in Town here : OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.478

Now that Circumstance of his Kindness to you , was not a Circumstance of
Time or Place . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.479

<font> Oates . <$$font> Then , my Lord , I shall begin with my Proofs :
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.480

but , my Lord , I desire I may have free Liberty to mind my Business ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.481

for here is a Gentleman behind me that will not let me be at quiet , but
is either meddling with me or my papers . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.482

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who is it ? OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.483

Let me know him , and I will take care to make him quiet , or set him
farther off . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.484

You , Gentlemen , that are at the Bar should know better , one would
think : OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.485

He must have liberty to make his own Defence ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.486

and if he complains and lets me know who meddles with him , they had
better do somewhat else . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.487

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , the first thing that I offer , is ,
that <font> Ireland <$$font> was convicted of Treason ,
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.488

and for that you have the Record . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.489

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> It is allowed of all sides , that <font>
Ireland <$$font> was convicted and attainted of Treason .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.490

<font> Oates . <$$font> Then , my Lord , the principal Defence which ,
as near as I can remember , Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> made at his
Trial , was an Endeavour to prove that he was not in Town between the
8th and 12th of <font> August <$$font> , nor the 1st and 2d Days of
<font> September <$$font> , which are the Points now in Issue ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.491

and he then produced on Mr. <font> Gifford <$$font> , and his Sister
and Mother ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.492

and fifteen or sixteen Witnesses were produced at Mr. <font> Whitebread
<$$font> 's Trial , of which there is another Record , that being six
Months after Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> was tried :
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.493

There Mr. <font> Whitebread <$$font> produces several Witnesses , Mr.
<font> Gifford <$$font> , I say , and several others , I think , to the
number of sixteen , which were to prove <font> Ireland <$$font> 's being
out of Town in these times that these Witnesses speak of .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.494

Now , my Lord , all those several Witnesses being produced to prove
<font> Ireland <$$font> then out of Town , the very Point that is now in
Issue , was then so ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.495

and notwithstanding all those Witnesses , the Jurors who tried Mr.
<font> Ireland <$$font> , and the Jurors who tried Mr. <font>
Whitebread <$$font> and the other four Jesuits , found them guilty ;
tho' they endeavour'd with all their force imaginable to oppose my
Testimony , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.496

and it was left to the Consideration of the Jury what their Witnesses
had said . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.497

If your Lordship pleases to remember , my Lord Chief Justice <font>
Scroggs <$$font> did observe to the Jury , that the Evidence of the
Prisoner at the Bar did consist only in Punctilio's of Time ; which , as
near as I can remember what he said , he called a nicety of Time ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.498

and in <font> Whitebread <$$font> 's Trial he was pleased to call it
catching in Point of Time . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.499

And it was observ'd at <font> Ireland <$$font> 's Trial , that his
Defence was so weak , that my Lord Chief Justice <font> Scroggs <$$font>
, upon the Integrity of <font> Bedloe <$$font> 's Evidence and mine ,
uses these Words to the Jury <paren> tho' he then endeavour'd to do what
these Witnesses do now <$$paren> : OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.500

It is most plain the Plot is discovered , and that by these Men , and
that it is a Plot , and a villainous one . Which shews not only the
Fullness and Satisfactoriness of our Proof that we gave , but does also
take notice of the little Shifts and catching Tricks he made use of to
prove himself out of Town ; which would not weigh with the Court .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.501

Therefore I observe , it is but the same Objection that then was made ,
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.502

and is not a new one now . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.503

And my Lord Chief Justice that then was , speaking of that Proof he
brought <paren> which the Court heard with patience , but could easily
see through the Vanity of it , <$$paren> said , What Arts they have of
evading this , I know not ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.504

for as they have turn'd their Learning into Subtilty , so they have
their Religion too . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.505

All this is well remembered by those that were by , and heard that Trial
: OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.506

And tho' <font> Ireland <$$font> laboured to disprove me in that
Circumstance of Time , yet still the Court did justify the Evidence that
Mr. <font> Bedloe <$$font> and myself had given .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.507

And the same Chief Justice said , I leave it to you to consider ,
whether you have not as much Evidence from these two Men as can be
expected in a Case of this nature ? And whether Mr. <font> Oates
<$$font> be not rather justified by the Testimony offer'd against him ,
than discredited ? OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.508

This was after his Plea was debated and considered :
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.509

and I must further observe to your Lordship , that tho' Mr. <font>
Ireland <$$font> by his false Witnesses pressed this matter as far as he
could then , and urged the Court to believe it ; yet when the Jury
brought in their Verdict and found him guilty , the Chief Justice
expressed the Satisfaction of the Court in these Words :
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.510

You have done , Gentlemen , like very good Subjects and very good
Christians ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.511

that is to say , like very good Protestants : OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.512

and now much good may their 30000 Masses do them .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.513

This , my Lord , was the Case of Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> , at his
Trial ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.90.514

<P_4.91>

and the same Point of his being out of Town was again managed before a
second Jury at the Trial of the five Jesuits ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.516

but the Court saw the Design of the Popish Party to blemish the Evidence
given of the Plot ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.517

but yet they look'd upon it only as a Trick . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.518

And my Lord Chief Justice <font> Scroggs <$$font> , in summing up the
Evidence at that Trial , says , They fall foul upon Mr. <font> Oates
<$$font> , meaning myself ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.519

he appears to have been their Agent , and whilst so , bad enough .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.520

But if he had not had a mind to become a good Man , he would not have
done us that good he has done , in the Discovery of the Design they had
engaged him in . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.521

And if your Lordship please to remember , that at that Trial of the five
Jesuits , when all Arts were used to prove <font> Ireland <$$font> out
of Town , and me at <font> St. Omers <$$font> , in the same Charge to
the Jury , my Lord <font> Scroggs <$$font> did take notice that the
Jesuits were very exact at catching in a Point of Time ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.522

but now says , that there is a thing that no Man can precisely charge
his Memory withal ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.523

and therefore he does there persuade the Jury , that that should not be
too strictly the Measure of their Judgments about Truth and Falshood ,
by the Mistake of seven or eight Days : OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.524

For , said he to the Jury , examine yourselves how often every day you
do mistake things that have been transacted half a Year ago , and err in
Point of Time , taking one Week for another , and one Month for another
; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.525

and therefore you are not to lay too great a Weight upon the Point of
Time . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.526

Now , if too great Weight , my Lord , be not to be laid upon a point of
Time , then this Charge that is now brought against me is not of weight
at all . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.527

And besides , my Lord , this ought to be considered , if this were the
great Objection then , and then answered , it ceases to be an Objection
now . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.528

And , as the Court did observe at the summing up of the Evidence , that
they made their Defence about the Uncertainty of a Point of Time , which
was no Defence at all ; so that , my Lord , the whole Course of my Plea
is this : 'T@ @is a hard case for a Man , after six Years , to be
indicted for a Circumstance of Time . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.529

I will first offer the Testimony of one Witness that is dead ,
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.530

and that is Mr. <font> Bedloe <$$font> , who at his Death confirmed all
that he had sworn of the Popish Plot to be true , and affirmed that he
had rather spoken less than the Truth , than more ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.531

and for that I desire that my Lord Keeper may be called , who took his
dying Examination . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.532

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> As for that , Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> ,
it is a thing very well known to the World , and particularly to a
worthy Gentleman that sits by you , <bracket> <font> Pointing to
<$$font> Mr. <font> North <$$font> <$$bracket> that Mr. <font> Bedloe
<$$font> , when he was sick , did make some such Protestation .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.533

<font> Oates . <$$font> Then , my Lord , I desire that Mr. <font>
Blaney <$$font> may be sworn , to give an account , what Mr. <font>
Bedloe <$$font> testified at Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> 's Trial .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.534

<font> Then Mr. <$$font> Blaney <font> was sworn . <$$font>
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.535

<font> Oates . <$$font> Mr. <font> Blaney <$$font> , pray will you see
in your Notes of <font> Ireland <$$font> 's Trial , whether Mr. <font>
Bedloe <$$font> did not swear that Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> was in
Town , the latter end of <font> August <$$font> 78 , or the beginning of
<font> September ? <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.536

Mr. <font> Blaney . <$$font> Whereabouts in the Trial is it , Sir ?
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.537

<font> Oates . <$$font> It is in the printed Trial , <font> folio
<$$font> 41 . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.538

Mr. <font> Blaney . <$$font> My Lord , I do find these Words in my
Notes , that Mr. <font> Bedloe <$$font> should say , about the latter
end of <font> August <$$font> , or the beginning of <font> September
<$$font> , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.539

but I believe it was the latter end of <font> August <$$font> , Mr.
<font> Ireland <$$font> was at <font> Harcourt <$$font> 's Chamber ,
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.540

and being asked the Question by my Lord Chief Justice <font> Scroggs
<$$font> , Whether he said positively , it was the latter end of <font>
August <$$font> ; he said it was in <font> August <$$font> ,
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.541

he would not be positive to a Day , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.542

but he thought the latter end . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.543

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> 'T@ @is very well known too , that <font>
Bedloe <$$font> did swear <font> Ireland <$$font> was in Town the latter
end of <font> August <$$font> , or beginning of <font> September
<$$font> ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.544

and to confirm it upon Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> 's Denial , you
swore he was in Town the 1st or 2d of <font> September <$$font> ; and
gave you twenty Shillings , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.545

that was the Occasion of your Oath . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.546

<font> Oates . <$$font> Then , my Lord , I desire to call some
Witnesses to testify to the Deposition that was taken of Mr. <font>
Jennison <$$font> , about <font> Ireland <$$font> 's being then in Town
. OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.547

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> When was that Deposition taken , and before
whom ? OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.548

<font> Oates . <$$font> It was taken in the Year 79 , by Sir <font>
Edmund Warcup <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.549

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But we can@ @not admit that in Evidence ,
unless the King's Counsel will consent . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.550

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , I will then produce what he swore at
another Trial . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.551

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why , where is he ?
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.552

Is he dead ? OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.553

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , it has cost a great deal of Money to
search him out ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.554

but I can@ @not any where meet with him , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.555

and that makes my Case so much harder that I can@ @not , when I have
done all that Man can do to get my Witnesses together .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.556

I sent in the depth of Winter for him , when I thought my Trial would
have come on before ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.557

but I could never hear of him . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.558

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> We can@ @not help that .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.559

<font> Oates . <$$font> Will what he said at any other Trial be
Evidence here ? OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.560

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Look you , though in strictness , unless the
Party be dead , we do not use to admit of any such Evidence ; yet if you
can prove any thing he swore at another Trial , we will indulge you so
far . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.561

<font> Oates . <$$font> Have you the record of Sir <font> George
Wakeman <$$font> 's Trial there , Sir <font> Samuel Astry ? <$$font>
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.562

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Here it is ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.563

if Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> have any use for it , we will lend it to
him . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.564

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Put it in ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.565

and now prove what you can , what <font> Jennison <$$font> swore at that
Trial . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.566

<font> Oates . <$$font> Mr. <font> Blaney <$$font> , have you your
Notes of Sir <font> George Wakeman <$$font> 's Trial here ?
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.567

Mr. <font> Blaney . <$$font> No , Sir , the Ticket of your <font>
Subpoena <$$font> did only mention <font> Ireland , Whitebread <$$font>
, and <font> Langhorn <$$font> 's Trials . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.568

But I did formerly upon another Occasion look for the Trial of Sir
<font> George Wakeman <$$font> , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.569

but could not find it among all my Notes . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.570

<font> Oates . <$$font> Sir , can you remember then what <font>
Jennison <$$font> swore at that Trial , about <font> Ireland <$$font> 's
being here in Town ? OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.571

Mr. <font> Blaney . <$$font> Truly , my Lord , I can never trust my
Memory at all when I take Notes ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.572

and it is now so long since that Trial , that I dare not undertake to
say I remember any Particulars of it . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.573

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> He says it is so long since , that he can@
@not remember any thing . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.574

But there is Sir <font> Edmund Warcup <$$font> now ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.575

Is he sworn ? OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.576

<font> Cryer . <$$font> Yes , my Lord . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.577

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What do you ask him then ?
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.578

<font> Oates . <$$font> I would desire to examine Sir <font> Edmund
Warcup <$$font> , my Lord , about the Deposition of <font> Jennison
<$$font> that he took . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.91.579

<P_4.92>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But we tell you that can@ @not be admitted
as Evidence , without they will consent to it on the other side .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.581

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , he proves Mr. <font> Ireland
<$$font> here the 19th of <font> August <$$font> ,
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.582

and that contradicts these Witnesses . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.583

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> If they will admit it , well and good ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.584

else we can@ @not do it . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.585

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> My Lord , we will be so fair with Mr.
<font> Oates <$$font> , if he will admit Mr. <font> Jennison <$$font>
's Letter , that is under his hand , wherein he does own that he was
mistaken in his whole Evidence about that matter , we will consent his
Deposition to be read . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.586

Mr. Just. <font> Withins . <$$font> If he will not consent to that ,
there 's no reason you should consent to the other , Mr. <font>
Attorney <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.587

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Look you , Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> , Mr.
<font> Attorney <$$font> makes you this Offer ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.588

you desire to have Mr. <font> Jennison <$$font> 's Depositions read ,
which can@ @not be done without their consent ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.589

they tell you they will consent , if you will let them prove what he has
own'd since about that Business . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.590

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , I will consent with all my heart ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.591

let them read any Letter under his hand . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.592

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well , do it on both sides by Consent ;
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.593

and now , Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> , do you produce his Examination .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.594

<font> Oates . <$$font> Pray , Sir <font> Edmund Warcup <$$font> , will
you please to give the Court an Account what Deposition Mr. <font>
Jennison <$$font> made before you , about <font> Ireland <$$font> 's
being in Town in <font> August <$$font> 78 ? OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.595

Sir <font> Edmund Warcup . <$$font> If my Lord commands me , I will .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.596

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay , you must answer his Question .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.597

Sir <font> Edmund Warcup . <$$font> This Mr. <font> Jennison <$$font>
did make one Information before me , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.598

and according to the Duty that was incumbent upon me , I deliver'd it to
the King and Council , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.599

and there it has lain ever since ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.600

for me to remember the Particulars of it , is impossible .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.601

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Have you his Examination here , Mr. <font>
Oates ? <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.602

If you have , shew it him . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.603

Sir <font> Edmund Warcup . <$$font> If I see my Hand to it , attesting
it was sworn before me , I can say somewhat to it .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.604

<font> Oates . <$$font> My Lord , he says he deliver'd it in to the
Council ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.605

but it is printed . - OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.606

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That is no Evidence , Man .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.607

Sir <font> Edmund Warcup . <$$font> I can say nothing to it , unless I
saw it under my own hand . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.608

<font> Oates . <$$font> That is impossible for me to have , my Lord .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.609

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I can@ @not tell how to help it .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.610

Sir <font> Edmund Warcup . <$$font> You have no more to say to me , Sir
, have you ? OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.611

<font> Oates . <$$font> No , Sir , I have not .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.612

Pray call <font> Sarah Batten <$$font> . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.613

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Is that the same that was <font> Sarah
Paine ? <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.614

<font> Oates . <$$font> I think so , Sir ; OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.615

I am not sure it is she , till she come hither .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.616

<font> Cryer . <$$font> Here is <font> Sarah Batten . <$$font>
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.617

<font> Oates . <$$font> Pray swear her , OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.618

and call Sir <font> Thomas Doleman . <$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.619

<bracket> <font> Which was done . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.620

But Sir <$$font> Thomas Doleman <font> did not appear . <$$font>
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.621

<font> Oates . <$$font> Pray was not your name <font> Sarah Paine ?
<$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.622

<font> Batten . <$$font> My Lord , I desire my Charges before I speak .
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.623

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What is your Name , good Woman ?
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.624

<font> Batten . <$$font> My name is <font> Sarah Batty . <$$font>
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.625

<font> Oates . <$$font> Was not your Name <font> Sarah Paine <$$font> ,

<font> Batty . <$$font> No , my Maiden-Name was <font> Sarah Edmunds .
<$$font> OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.627

<font> Oates . <$$font> Was not you a Witness at the Trial of Mr.

<font> Batty . <$$font> No , Sir . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.629

<font> Oates . <$$font> Did not you live with my Lord <font> Arlington

<font> Batty . <$$font> No , Sir . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.631

<font> Oates . <$$font> Then I have been at all this Charge for nothing

Are you sure your Name was not <font> Sarah Paine ? <$$font> -
OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.633

<font> Batty . <$$font> No , indeed , Sir . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.634

<font> Oates . <$$font> They told me that she liv'd at <font> Uxbridge

OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.673

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nor we neither . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.675

Witness in the Trial of Sir <font> George Wakeman <$$font> ,

, who was produced to prove the Circumstance of Mr. <font> Jennison
<$$font> 's Evidence : OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.677

in two or three Words . OATES-1685-E3-P2,4.92.678
