<font> Duke . <$$font> This is not true , saving that indeed Advice was
broken to me of conveying her away at a Window , at a Gallery's-@ @end ,
in one of my Lord of <font> Shrewsbury <$$font> 's Houses , of the which
Window the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> had taken a measure ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.3

but this Device was overthrown at such time as it was told me .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.4

As for that which <font> Barker <$$font> hath here confess'd , it is
utterly false . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.5

<font> Serj. <$$font> Now shall you hear the Duke's own Confession .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.6

Here was read the Duke's Examination , 13 <font> Octobris . <$$font>
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.7

<font> Serj. <$$font> Besides this , the Duke being in Prison in the
<font> Tower <$$font> , made a Submission to the Queen's Majesty ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.8

confess'd his Error in dealing with the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.9

and promis'd , upon his Faith and Allegiance , never to deal with that
Marriage , nor with any other Matter touching the <font> Scotish
<$$font> Queen . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.10

<font> Duke <$$font> I confess I did so . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.11

<font> Serj. <$$font> Before his subscribing his said Submission , he
first made the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen privy to it ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.12

and sent her a Double of it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.13

<font> Duke . <$$font> I sent it to the <font> Bishop of <font> Rosse
<$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.14

<font> Serj. <$$font> All is one . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.15

<font> Duke . <$$font> I confess it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.16

<font> Serj. <$$font> What should move my Lord of <font> Norfolk
<$$font> now so earnestly still to pursue this Marriage ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.17

You see he liked not the Person , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.18

she was not of good Fame , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.19

he so signify'd to the Queen , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.20

he so reported to <font> Bannister . <$$font>
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.21

The Kingdom of <font> Scotland <$$font> he esteem'd not ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.22

and also it was out of her Possession , in the hands of the King her Son
, by her own Dimission ratify'd by Parliament .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.23

Forsooth he had an old blind Prophecy lying by him : <font> In
exaltatione Lunae Leo succumbet , & Leo cum Leone conjungetur , & catuli
eorum regnabunt <$$font> ; which belike is thus to be expounded ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.24

<font> At the Exaltation of the Moon <$$font> <paren> which was the
Rising of the Earl of <font> Northumberland <$$font> , that giveth the
Moon <$$paren> the <font> Lion <$$font> <paren> which is the Queen's
Majesty <$$paren> <font> shall be overthrown <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.25

<font> then shall the Lion be join'd with a Lion <$$font> <paren> which
is the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> with the <font> Scotish <$$font>
Queen , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.26

for they both bear Lions in their Arms <$$paren>
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.27

<font> and their Whelps shall reign <$$font> <paren>
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.28

that is , their Posterity shall have the Kingdom <$$paren> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.29

<font> Duke . <$$font> I do not remember any such Prophecy .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.30

<font> Serj. <$$font> It was in your own keeping .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.31

<font> Duke . <$$font> What should I do with it ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.32

<font> Serj. <$$font> Such blind Prophecies have oft deceiv'd Noblemen
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.33

<font> Duke . <$$font> This is nothing to the purpose ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.34

I kept it not to any such end . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.35

<font> Serj. <$$font> You utter'd it to your Servant <font> Hickford .
<$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.36

Here was produced and read <font> Hickford <$$font> 's Testimony .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.37

<font> Duke . <$$font> A Toy ! THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.38

You see I call it a foolish Prophecy <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.39

<font> Serj. <$$font> Where had you it ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.40

<font> Duke . <$$font> I remember it not .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.41

<font> Serj. <$$font> Hitherto have you heard the Evidence to prove the
Duke's Imagination , Compassing , and Conspiracy , to deprive the
Queen's Majesty of the Crown and her Royal Estate , and so to bring her
Highness to Death and Destruction . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.42

For proving this his Intent , you have heard those Matters prov'd , his
Practice to join himself in Marriage with the <font> Scotish <$$font>
Queen , whom he then well knew falsely to claim and pretend Title to the
present possession of the Crown of <font> England : <$$font> also his
prosecuting the same Marriage without the Queen's Majesty's Knowledge ,
against her Highness's express Commandment upon his Allegiance , against
his Faith , Promise , and Submission ; yea , and to pursue that with
force , and to use the Advice and Strength of his Friends , to maintain
the same force against the Queen ; his hearkening to blind Prophecies ,
Money by him lent to the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen , and against the
Queen his Sovereign Lady . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.43

If then his Purpoose so were to pursue it with force , it must needs
follow , that the same must be of Intent , Imagination , and Compassing
, to deprive and depose the Queen's Majesty from her Crown , Royal
Estate , and Dignity , and to advance and maintain that false and
usurp'd Title of the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen unto the present
possession of the Crown of <font> England <$$font> , and so consequently
, for maintenance of his Imagination and Purpose , to compass the
Queen's Majesty's Death and Destruction . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.44

Now shall you further hear Proof of his own words , declaring the same
intent to pursue the Marriage by force , and rather to lose his Life
than give it over . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.45

<heading>

Cavendish's <font> Deposition <$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.47

<$$heading>

That at his several Journies unto the Places of the Queen of <font>
Scots <$$font> Abode , the Duke procur'd him to labour the Cause of his
Marriage with her with all diligence . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.49

<font> Item <$$font> , That her Majesty being at <font> Southampton ,
Richard Candish <$$font> , a certain Night walking in his Chamber , and
persuading him by all means to labour for the Queen's Favour concerning
that Marriage ; the Duke affirm'd that before he lost that Marriage he
would lose his Life : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.50

and said moreover , that if ever he handled thing wisely or cunningly ,
I would say it was the Matter of that Marriage , if I knew it from the
beginning . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.51

<font> Item <$$font> , That the Monday at night , after the Duke's
Departure from <font> Southampton , Richard Candish <$$font> being at
<font> Hayward-House <$$font> with him , in the Company of the Lord
<font> Lumley <$$font> , the Duke and the said Lord <font> Lumley
<$$font> talking secretly together , suddenly the Duke brake out into
this Speech : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.52

<font> Candish <$$font> , quoth he , <font> is able to accuse me of no
disloyal Practices . <$$font> Whereat the Lord <font> Lumley <$$font> ,
as it were wondering , <font> Can he not indeed <$$font> , quoth he ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.53

<font> No indeed <$$font> , quoth the Duke ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,1,100.54

and <P_101> turning to <font> Candish <$$font> , said , <font> Candish ,
I in this Case defy thee , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.55

say thy worst . <$$font> To which <font> Candish <$$font> answer'd ,
<font> Besides the Practice of this Marriage , I truly can accuse you of
none . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.56

Item <$$font> , The Duke , at another time , in the said House , ask'd
<font> Candish , If God take away the Queen's Majesty , whether he could
assure him of his Brother <$$font> Candish , <font> and procure his said
Brother to promise unto him Sir <$$font> Robert Ningfield ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.57

<font> Item <$$font> , At his last being at <font> Remming-Hall <$$font>
, among many others talking , he had this Speech ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.58

<font> Candish <$$font> <paren> quoth he <$$paren> <font> nothing will
undo us but the Rising of the <$$font> Northern <font> Lords <$$font> .
To whom I answered , <font> God forbid that any such thing should be ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.59

for it will undo us all <$$font> ; whereat he replying , said , <font> I
fear they will rise . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.60

Duke . <$$font> The Duke looking upon <font> Cavendish <$$font> with a
scornful and smiling Countenance , said , <font> You are an honest Man !
<$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.61

That which he saith of the Talk between him and me at <font> Southampton
<$$font> , is utterly false : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.62

At that time you were most earnest on my part ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.63

and came to me as for Succour , for that as you said your Cousin <font>
Christmas <$$font> was fallen out with you . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.64

When we rode to my Lord of <font> Pembroke <$$font> 's , you came to me
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.65

and told me , my Lord <font> Burleigh <$$font> findeth me well ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.66

I will ride with him and find his Humour , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.67

and I will face that Fellow thorowly ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.68

so from <font> Salisbury <$$font> you said you would ride to <font>
Leicester <$$font> , and so home with my Lord <font> Burleigh <$$font> ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.69

and you doubted not to bring me such word from him as should satisfy me
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.70

You told me how my Lord of <font> Leicester <$$font> was firm , and Sir
<font> Nicholas Throckmorton <$$font> my sure Friend ; and that they
would both join to deal with the Queen for me ; and how Sir <font>
Nicholas Throckmorton <$$font> sent me word , That he doubted not the
Queen would take order to my Contentation at her next Coming to a staid
House . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.71

Then came you to <font> London <$$font> , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.72

and tho' I had no great Liking of you , yet because you were loth to lie
at <font> Arundel <$$font> 's , and were somewhat ill at ease , I let
you lie in my House . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.73

I never made great account of you ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.74

my Lord of <font> Leicester <$$font> made us first acquainted ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.75

your Brother you know was not my Friend . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.76

I then took you as I now find you . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.77

While you could hold on , you shew'd your Letters that you did write on
my behalf ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.78

then you came to me THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.79

and said , you had need , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.80

and borrowed Money of me ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.81

I had none at that time , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.82

but I sent it you by <font> Bowes <$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.83

I was warned by divers of my Friends to take heed of you ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.84

you dealt with <font> Dier <$$font> and with <font> Straunge <$$font>
very maliciously . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.85

As for the Speech at <font> Remming-Hall <$$font> , that you speak of me
, it is untrue ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.86

I dealt not with you there about any such matter ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.87

I left you at <font> London <$$font> , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.88

I looked not for you ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.89

when you came , I was glad to be rid of you ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.90

you said you were going to <font> Norwich <$$font> ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.91

and I was glad you were going , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.92

and willed you to look at my House at <font> Norwich <$$font> , and tell
me how you liked it : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.93

Out of the <font> North <$$font> I heard nothing in six Weeks before .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.94

You suddenly slipped away from me , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.95

and then I came up to <font> London <$$font> ward ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.96

you are an honest Man , indeed ! THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.97

It is all false that he hath said . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.98

Then <font> Cavendish <$$font> began to report and justify what he had
said , and to put the Duke in remembrance , when the Duke gave him
reproachful words of Discredit . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.99

<font> Serj. <$$font> He is sworn , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.100

there needeth no more proving ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.101

you sent <font> Havers <$$font> to the Earl of <font> Westmoreland
<$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.102

Then was alledged the Examination of one <font> Haveling <$$font>
touching <font> Havers <$$font> , whom the Duke sent to the Earl of
<font> Northumberland <$$font> , with this Message , <font> That if the
two Earls should rise , he were undone . <$$font>
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.103

<font> Duke . <$$font> This may be seen of two years old , and by me
fully delivered and answered . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.104

Then was read the Confession of <font> Havers <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.105

Then was alledged a Letter of the <font> Scottish <$$font> Queen's in
Cipher to the Duke , containing , that the Lord of <font> Shrewsbury
<$$font> had told her , that the Earl of <font> Northumberland <$$font>
was deliver'd to the Earl of <font> Sussex <$$font> ; for which she was
very sorrowful three days together , for fear of cumbring of Friend if
he were taken . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.106

<font> Serj. <$$font> What Friends was she so careful for , that she
wrote to the Duke , unless she thought it should light upon the Duke
himself ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.107

<font> Duke . <$$font> That Letter never came to my hands .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.108

<font> Serj. <$$font> It was found in the Bag which you willed to be
burned . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.109

Then the said Letter was read . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.110

<font> Duke . <$$font> All this is nothing to me .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.111

<font> Serj. <$$font> This proveth in you a Practice to the Rebellion ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.112

for all her Sorrow of the yielding of the Earl of <font> Northumberland
<$$font> was , for fear he should bewray and cumber her Friends .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.113

<font> Duke . <$$font> That toucheth not me ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.114

for I am sure the Earl of <font> Northumberland <$$font> hath been
sought for me , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.115

and yet he can@ @not accuse me . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.116

<font> Serj. <$$font> Had it not concerned you , it had not been
written to you . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.117

<font> Duke . <$$font> Some Letters never came to my hands :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.118

sometime they came to the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , sometime to
<font> Bannister <$$font> , sometime not all deciphered ; as <font>
Straunge <$$font> and <font> Bowes <$$font> , and other that have been
Messengers for me , can tell . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.119

Here Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> began to prosecute the second part ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.120

and spake first to this effect . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.121

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Now you have heard enough of the first
matter . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.122

In this Indictment are contained three principal Treasons , whereof the
first is imagining and conspiring the Deprivation , Death , and
Destruction of the Queen's Majesty : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.123

for proof hereof , it hath been truly said , That to imagine , compass ,
or procure the Deposing or Death of the Prince , is High-Treason by the
Statute of 25 <font> Edward <$$font> III . and at the Common-Law ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.124

for the Statute is but a Declaration what was Treason at Common Law :
which Imagination , when it appeareth by Overt-@ @fact , must needs be
judged Treason ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.125

for Overt-@ @fact is but a shewing of a Man's mind , which when a Man by
outward Speech or Deed hath uttered , it must needs be judged that so
was his meaning ; which must be gathered by such means , as it may be
made to appear . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.126

For no Traitor is so bold , to say expresly , he will depose or kill the
King ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.127

but often it hath been seen , that they go about indirectly , and by
means that tend to that End : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.128

and therefore he that goeth about to stir the People to Rebellion , or
to levy War within the Realm , to assail or withstand the Prince by
Force , is taken to seek the Death of the Prince .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.129

Now therefore to prove that the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> hath
imagined and compassed the Deposing and Death of the Queen's Majesty ,
this hath been shewed you : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.130

first , by secret and indirect means , he sought to join himself in
Marriage with the <font> Scottish <$$font> Queen , who pretendeth Title
to the Queen's Crown . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.131

This he did without the Queen's Majesty's privity , against her
Highness's express Commandment upon his Allegiance , against his own
Promise and Submission . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.132

First , being at <font> York <$$font> , a Commissioner appointed by the
Queen , contrary to his Oath and Charge , he dealt undirectly and
partially , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.133

and play'd an untrue part with the Queen ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.134

he secretly practised for the Marriage . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,101.135

<P_102>

This being objected against him , he hath denied it :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.137

you have heard it testified by three Witnesses , the Earl of <font>
Murray , Ledington <$$font> , and the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.138

So it appeareth , that all that Practice and indirect Dealing was to
this end , to compasse the Deprivation and Death of the Queen's Majesty
; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.139

for he well knew that the <font> Scottish <$$font> Queen made Title to
the present Possession of the Crown of <font> England <$$font> ; that
she denyed the Queen's Majesty to be lawful Queen of this Realm ; that
she usurped the Royal Style ; that she quartered the Arms of <font>
England <$$font> without any difference : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.140

all this he knew , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.141

he was of the Queen's Majesty's Privy Council at the same time ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.142

he knew that she made no Renunciation of her unjust Claim , tho' it were
required of her . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.143

It was also one Article in the Commission where he himself was
Commissioner , To require the Recognition of her Error , and of the
Queen's Majesty's present Right : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.144

he knew well it was not done . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.145

If the <font> Scottish <$$font> Queen claimed such present Title , then
was she no Friend to the Queen's Majesty , but a Seeker of her
Highness's Overthrow and Destruction : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.146

and yet the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> knowing this , practised to
compass this Marriage . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.147

Wherefore , I pray you , sought he that Marriage ; yea , and sought it
as he meant to atchieve it with Force ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.148

It was not in respect of her Person , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.149

for he knew her not ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.150

it could not be for any good Report of her virtuous Conditions ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.151

for he had an evil Opinion of her : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.152

he did by his writing certify against her , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.153

he declared to <font> Bannister <$$font> that he thought very ill of her
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.154

It was not for her Title to the Kingdom of <font> Scotland <$$font> ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.155

for neither was she possessed of it , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.156

neither did he esteem it though she had it .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.157

Wherefore sought he her then ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.158

Surely in respect of that unjust Claim and Title that she pretended to
the present Possession of the Crown of <font> England <$$font> ; which
Title can@ @not be maintained without evident purpose to depose the
Queen's Majesty , and to bring her to Death and Destruction , which is
plain Treason by the Statute of 25 <font> Edward <$$font> III .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.159

for no more can <font> England <$$font> bear two Queens , than the World
can bear two Suns . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.160

And how should we have maintained it , but with Force ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.161

And how could that have been , without depriving of the Queen's Majesty
from the Royal Estate ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.162

And could that have been done , without compassing her Highness's Death
and Destruction ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.163

for the Jealousy of an Usurper can@ @not suffer the just Prince to live
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.164

This your Honours are to search and consider ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.165

and to your Judgments we refer it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.166

Now my Lord of <font> Norfolk <$$font> 's chief and only Answer is but
his bare Denial , which is no sufficient Answer ; specially sith he
himself hath fallen into so great discredit , by doing against his Word
, his Hand , his Oath . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.167

He promised , being commanded upon his Allegiance , never to deal in
that matter ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.168

he promised , by his Submission under his own Hand , utterly to forsake
it , and to deal no more with the <font> Scottish <$$font> Queen for
that Marriage , nor any other matter : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.169

He promised by Oath specially taken when he was Commissioner for hearing
the matter at <font> York <$$font> , to do therein directly and
indifferently without partiality . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.170

All these Oaths and Promises he hath broken , beside the Oath of a
Counsellor which he hath also broken , in disclosing the Queen's Secrets
, and in secret practising against her express Commandment .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.171

Now also , since he was last apprehended and committed , he hath denyed
certain things , which he hath afterward , being constrained with
strength of proof , confessed ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.172

yea , he hath denyed those things upon his Oath , which he hath
afterward granted to be true : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.173

so is he not to be believed upon his Word , if his own Word discredit
him , how great soever he be in Degree . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.174

<font> Duke . <$$font> Upon the Statute of 25 <font> Edward <$$font>
III. he inferreth , that it is Treason to imagine or compass the
Deprivation and Death of the Queen's Majesty ; as the Lord forbid ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.175

and I pray God I may sooner be buried in the Earth , than I should seek
or attempt any thing to the Destruction of her Majesty's Person .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.176

There is a Maxim in Law , that penal Statutes must be construed strictly
, and no penal Statute ought to be extended further than the very words
: THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.177

Now in all that my Accusers have deposed or said against me , how false
soever it be , there is not one of them that say I went about any hurt
to her Majesty's Person , or that I levied or practised to levy any
Power against her , or to do any of those things that are contained for
Treasons within the words of the Statute . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.178

Is the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> a sufficient Witness against me ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.179

He is a Stranger and a <font> Scot <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.180

a Stranger can be no sufficient Witness , let alone a <font> Scot :
<$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.181

for whereas when there is Peace between the Queen's Majesty and a
foreign Realm , the People of that foreign Realm may freely come and
traffick in this Realm ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.182

yet tho' there be a Peace between <font> England <$$font> and <font>
Scotland <$$font> , if a <font> Scot <$$font> come into <font> England
<$$font> without a Passport , he may be a lawful Prisoner .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.183

Again , I can@ @not tell what he may for fear .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.184

<font> Bracton <$$font> saith , That Witnesses must be <font> Liberi
Homines <$$font> , Free Men , full Age , Honest , and of Good Report ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.185

the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> is none such .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.186

So is nothing proved of any Overt-@ @fact against me ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.187

neither am I accused by any but the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> ,
who can be no sufficient Witness against me .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.188

What care I what <font> Hamlin <$$font> says ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.189

It toucheth me not . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.190

As for <font> Havers <$$font> , I never sent him with any such Message :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.191

indeed I asked him what Company he found with my Brother of <font>
Westmoreland <$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.192

But as for my Lord of <font> Northumberland <$$font> , I sent not to him
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.193

If I might have brought forth my Proofs , I could have brought forth
Proofs of good fame , that I sent no such Message ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.194

I could have proved it by Confessions , and not by Hearsay .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.195

So is only the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> Witness against me ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.196

and what he is , all you perceive . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.197

I never heard of the Rebellion , till Sir <font> Henry Nevill <$$font>
told me of it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.198

If I had had such a mind when I was in <font> Norfolk <$$font> , I
needed not to have come hither ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.199

I could have made a shift well enough . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.200

If I had intended any such Rebellion or Treason , I would not have put
my Lord of <font> Northumberland <$$font> in trust withal , nor yet my
Brother of <font> Westmoreland <$$font> , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.201

nor would have come hither to put my Head in the Halter in the <font>
Tower : <$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.202

but being as I was , in such place where I might have shifted , I would
have kept me from coming here well enough . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.203

If Fear had moved me , and that I doubted of mine own Case , I could
easily have avoided . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.204

So , I say , to prove me guilty of Treason , you must shew some Overt-@
@fact that I have done against her Majesty's Person :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.205

And to the Witnesses , I think I have said sufficiently .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.206

As touching my dealing with the <font> Scottish <$$font> Queen , so far
as I dealt without compass of Treason , this I say for my meaner Faults
, inferior to Treason , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.207

I have with Repentance and Humility submitted my self to the Queen's
Majesty , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.208

I beseech you confound not those with this Case :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.209

but in my dealing with her about Marriage , I pray you draw it not to
such Intention , to advance her Title against the Queen ; because , tho'
she once made such Claim , yet considering what Amity hath since been
between the Queen and her , to make her now an Enemy , is hard ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,102.210

and surely to marry her , tho' I <P_103> treated of it , I never
concluded , minded , nor intended . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.211

Where it@ @'s said I was privy to the Device of her taking away , I
utterly deny it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.212

If I had been so , I would not have been against her ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.213

nor would have certified against her ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.214

I ever advised her to submit her self to the Queen's Majesty :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.215

but when no Overt-@ @Fact of Treason can be proved against me , to bring
me in thus by Arguments and Circumstances , I think it very hard .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.216

If I should have stolen her away , I could not do it alone :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.217

was I so destitute of Friends , that I could not make any Man privy to
it ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.218

And who is there that accuseth me of it , that may spend five Marks a
year ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.219

Now sith nothing is proved against me by any Witness sufficient , I
beseech you consider favourably of me . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.220

Indeed my Brother of <font> Westmoreland <$$font> sent me his Man with
Recommendations ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.221

and I sent him , by his Man , a Ring which my Sister had sent me before
; and also <font> Havers <$$font> with this Message , <font> Commend me
to my Brother of <$$font> Westmoreland , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.222

<font> and tell him that I am well , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.223

mine Innocency shall deliver me : <$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.224

but nothing touching any Rising at all . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.225

If ever I were privy to that Rebellion , then condemn me of all the
Treasons that you lay against me . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.226

<font> Attorney . <$$font> My Lord and I are now at issue upon this
point ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.227

I affirm it with Proofs , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.228

and his Lordship barely denieth it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.229

If his Intent were to compass the Marriage , knowing her to pretend
Title of the present Possession of the Crown ; then must this grow to an
Imagining to depose the Queen , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.230

and then it is Treason . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.231

An Overt-@ @fact is a Declaration of the Mind ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.232

Letters , Tokens , Speeches , Messages , and such like , be Overt-@
@facts . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.233

Now if you had married her , you must have maintained her pretended
Title , which you could not have done without manifest Purpose and
Compassing to depose the Queen , and to bring her to Death , which is
High-Treason . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.234

Now beside , there is one other Fact , which I will give you in Evidence
; which most evidently proveth the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> 's
Imagination and Compassing to depose and destroy the Queen .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.235

It is well known that <font> Pius <$$font> V. the Bishop of <font> Rome
<$$font> , is the Queen's Majesty's notorious Enemy ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.236

he hath been so published ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.237

he hath so shewed himself in his proceedings ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.238

he hath shewed it in his Bulls , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.239

they have been brought into this Realm , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.240

and some have suffered for them . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.241

The Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> knowing it to be so , hath practised
with his Factor , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.242

hath sent unto the Pope for Aid and Force against the Queen :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.243

he conferred with one <font> Rodolph <$$font> a Merchant Stranger , to
go over the Sea to the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> , and to the Pope ,
in the Name of the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen and the Duke of <font>
Norfolk <$$font> , to procure Power to invade this Realm , for the
Advancement of the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen's false Title to the
Crown of this Realm of <font> England <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.244

and in the mean time , the Duke promised to move her Friends to levy
such Power as they were able , to assist the Strangers when they came in
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.245

If this be proved unto you , then is it flat Treason .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.246

To use Force against her Majesty in her own Realm , must needs be done
with intent to depose her , which Force she must needs resist ; which if
she be not able to do , then followeth her Death and Destruction .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.247

My Lords , here goeth still all to one manner of purpose , his own bare
denial , and allowing of no sufficient Witness ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.248

but here God himself shall be Witness : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.249

this is a matter opened by God himself . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.250

It was known , that a Treason was in hand ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.251

many Searches were made to understand it , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.252

no Man could by any Travel find it out , till God himself opened it ; so
as the Saying is fulfilled , <font> What is done in secret shall be made
open . <$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.253

The Treasons my Lords of the Council knew of ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.254

it appeared in <font> April <$$font> last , that such a Treason was ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.255

but whom it toucheth was not known to them , no not to him that opened
it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.256

So as God hath opened it , to affirm these mean Men to be of credit .
The Treason being known to the Privy-Council half a year together , yet
could they not understand the Party , till God disclosed it by
marvellous chance . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.257

In <font> August <$$font> last there was six_hundred Pound of Money
prepared to be sent with Letters into <font> Scotland <$$font> to the
Queen's Enemies , for their Relief and Maintenance , and by the Duke of
<font> Norfolk <$$font> 's appointment to be conveyed to his Man <font>
Bannister <$$font> , and so into <font> Scotland <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.258

This Money was delivered to one <font> Browne <$$font> of <font>
Shrewsbury <$$font> , by one of the Duke's Servants , one <font>
Hickford <$$font> ; who said to <font> Browne , Here is 50 l .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.259

I pray you help that it be conveyed to Mr. <$$font> Bannister's <font>
Dwelling near <$$font> Shrewsbury . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.260

<font> Browne <$$font> having received the Money , tho' the Bulk was
somewhat like the proportion of 50 <font> l. <$$font> in Silver , yet
the Weight , by reason it was Gold , made him suspect it : whereupon he
went to one of the Queen's Privy-Council , and disclosed his Suspicion ,
that so he might learn what he carried . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.261

This Bag being opened , there was found 600 <font> l. <$$font> in Gold
, and certain Letters withal , to the Queen's Enemies , and to <font>
Bannister : <$$font> Whereupon the Duke's Man , that sent the Money ,
was apprehended ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.262

and then , by God's good Providence , was it found that this Treason
touched the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> , under Name and Cipher of
<font> Quarante <$$font> 40 , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.263

and another Nobleman was signified by the Cipher of 3 <font> Trente
<$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.264

Then fell out new Matters : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.265

Certain of the Duke's Servants examined , whether they knew of any
Cipher used to any Man by the Name <font> Quarante <$$font> , they
confessed that <font> Quarante <$$font> was the Duke of <font> Norfolk
<$$font> ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.266

they were kept in several Places , the Bishop also a Prisoner in a place
several from them all , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.267

and yet they all agreed in one . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.268

So God's Work hath enforced their Credit by their Agreement , being
severally kept . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.269

Thus came it to light by God's own Work . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.270

Now see what the Cause was : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.271

The great Treason was contained in Letters written in Cipher , to one
signified by the Number <font> Quarante <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.272

this <font> Quarante <$$font> was for the Duke ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.273

and so the Duke confesseth . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.274

What Cause had they to suspect him ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.275

Letters from <font> Rodolph <$$font> made mention of great Treason , and
of Provision of Men from beyond the Seas , to invade this Realm ,
according to his Order and Request , who was meant by <font> Quarante
<$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.276

If then we shall prove unto you that <font> Rodolph <$$font> had this
Message and Commission from the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen and the
Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> , to treat with the Pope , King <font>
Philip <$$font> and the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> , for the bringing
in of ten_thousand Men to invade <font> England <$$font> , and to make
War against the Queen in her own Realm ; there must needs be compassing
to depose the Queen , and to bring her to Death , and for High-Treason :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.277

For he that will levy Force to invade or make War in a Prince's Realm ,
and that in Maintenance of a Title to the present enjoying of the Crown
, doth what he can to depose the Prince , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.278

and consequently also doth what he can to destroy the Prince .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,103.279

Now to prove that the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> dealt in this
manner , sent this Message , and practised to bring in this Force of
Strangers , and to levy War against the Queen within the Realm , it
shall be good first to shew what manner of Man this <P_104> <font>
Rodolph <$$font> was : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.280

He was one that lived divers Years here in this Realm , a notable
Traitor and Enemy to the Queen and Realm of <font> England <$$font> ,
and of long time the Pope's Factor . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.281

In the Duke's first Trouble , this <font> Rodolph <$$font> was suspected
of such Practices , and therefore by the Council committed to the
Custody of Mr. <font> Walsingham <$$font> till <font> October <$$font>
was Twelve-month ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.282

and for that no evident Matter appeared , he was delivered again in the
<font> November <$$font> following : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.283

So soon as he was delivered , he by and by opened to the Bishop of
<font> Rosse <$$font> , That he was Factor for the Pope ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.284

he shewed him his Commission , and sundry Letters written to him by the
Pope's Nuncio in <font> France <$$font> , about Matters of the Practice
a long time . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.285

This <font> Rodolph <$$font> was well known to the <font> Scotish
<$$font> Queen , the Pope himself and his Nuncio recommending him to the
<font> Scotish <$$font> Queen : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.286

The Duke was made privy of it , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.287

and made him privy to his dealings , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.288

and kept it secret from the Queen and her Council .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.289

When the Bull was brought over , that <font> Felton <$$font> died for ,
this <font> Rodolph <$$font> had six Copies of it , and dispersed them ;
whereof he gave one to the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , one other
to the <font> Spanish <$$font> Embassador , and the third to the <font>
French <$$font> Embassador , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.290

and the rest we know not what he did with them .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.291

Now the Duke knowing him to be such a one , he was a fit Man to deal
with . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.292

That he was such a one , and that the Duke well knew it , and sent him
in Message to the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> , and to the Pope , you
shall see plainly proved . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.293

Then what his Message was , you shall see also disclosed , and how
things hidden will , by God's Providence , come to light .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.294

The Letters were written in Cipher , and decipher'd , and the Cipher hid
in the Tiles , and found by chance ; so as it may appear God's own Work
to open these Treasons . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.295

Here the Duke took exception to his saying , that the Cipher was found
in the Tiles ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.296

and said , it was not the Cipher that was found there , but the Alphabet
: THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.297

so the Duke always in his Speech called the Letters or Matter written in
strange Characters , the Cipher ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.298

and the Paper of the Characters themselves he called the Alphabet ,
which Mr. Attorney usually called the Cipher .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.299

Then was read the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> 's confession the 3d
of <font> November <$$font> , to the 5th Article .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.300

Also <font> Rosse <$$font> 's Confession ad 7 Artic. litera 6.
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.301

Also his Confession the last of <font> October <$$font> , Article 23 .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.302

All this the Duke denied , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.303

and said , I never saw any Letters from the Pope , but one , which I
will speak of anon . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.304

Then was read the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> to the 6th , 7th , and
8th , making mention of a Pacquet , wherein was one Letter to the Duke ,
by the Title of <font> Quarante <$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.305

Then was read the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> 's Confession , 26th
of <font> October <$$font> , Fo. 2. concerning <font> Andrew Beton
<$$font> 's coming . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.306

<font> Attorney . <$$font> The Duke had these deciphered ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.307

and read them . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.308

Then was read <font> Barker <$$font> 's Confession 6th of <font>
November <$$font> , Article 3. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.309

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Thus plainly appeareth , that the Duke was
privy to these Messages to the Pope , and Conference with his Factor :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.310

Now it resteth to understand what followeth of this Course begun with
<font> Rodoloph <$$font> the Pope's Factor ; what Messages were sent ;
what Practices devis'd ; and what ensued . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.311

Upon this Letter , the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen wrote a Letter to
the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , wherein she wrote back a Discourse
of her Estate and Device , what she thought best to be done , referring
all to the Direction of the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.312

Here is the Letter itself to be seen . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.313

This Letter came to the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.314

he sent it over to the Duke , with a Letter from the <font> Scotish
<$$font> Queen to the Duke . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.315

This Letter was deciphered , and found hidden in the Duke's House under
the Mats in an Entry , in the Way as the Duke went to his Bed-chamber ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.316

the Cipher it self was found in the Tiles of the House .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.317

This plainly declareth , how the Duke in dealing with the <font> Scotish
<$$font> Queen and the Pope , pursued his Purpose of advancing the
<font> Scotish <$$font> Queen to the Crown of <font> England : <$$font>
That the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen was in practice for it with the
Pope , and referred the Dispatch of <font> Rodolph <$$font> to the Duke
; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.318

and the Receipt of those Letters is confessed by <font> Hickford
<$$font> , and by the Duke himself . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.319

Here was read the Letter of the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen to the
Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.320

<font> Attorney . <$$font> By this Letter appeareth , how the <font>
Scotish <$$font> Queen hath set out the whole Plot of the Treason :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.321

A Message should be sent for Aid from foreign parts ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.322

<font> Rodolph <$$font> the fittest Man to be the Messenger ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.323

and that <font> Rodolph <$$font> should be dispatched to go about it ,
when the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> would .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.324

The Device was to move King <font> Philip <$$font> for Aid , upon a
Consideration of her State here , to enter into Deliberation of the Time
and Opportunities to set her Friends to Field , and to seize themselves
of her . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.325

This is confessed by <font> Hickford <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.326

and this Letter is also confessed by the Duke himself , that he received
it about <font> January <$$font> was Twelve-month , and it was hid under
the Matts . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.327

<font> Duke . <$$font> I bid that the Letter should be burnt .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.328

<font> Attorney . <$$font> God would not have it so ; but that it
should remain for disclosing the Matter . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.329

<font> Duke . <$$font> As touching <font> Rodolph <$$font> , what
Manner of Man he was , is no matter to me : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.330

I know of no more , nor am to be charged with no more than I my self am
privy to . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.331

I never dealt with him about any Cause of mine .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.332

I received no such Letter , but that which <font> Barker <$$font> said
came from him , which was not that of <font> January <$$font> that you
speak of , about two years ago ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.333

and as for Instructions and Letters about that <font> January <$$font>
was Twelve-month , I received none . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.334

<font> Burleigh . <$$font> Here the Lord <font> Burleigh <$$font> said
to Mr. Attorney , You may mistake , it was this time Twelve-month ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.335

for now we are in <font> January <$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.336

And so Mr. Attorney remembring this present Month to be <font> January
<$$font> , referred the Letter to <font> January <$$font> now a Year
past ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.337

and said , This Letter that I now charged you with , came to your hands
at this <font> January <$$font> was Twelve-month :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.338

It came first to the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen's hand ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.339

she took occasion upon considering her own Case here in <font> England
<$$font> , in <font> France <$$font> , and in her own Country , that it
was best for her to cleave unto <font> Spain <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.340

She wrote to the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> her Discourse to that
end : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.341

She counted <font> Rodolph <$$font> the fittest Messenger ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.342

Matter was devised for his Instructions ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.343

she referred the Dispatch wholly to the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font>
; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.344

the Duke dealt in it , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.345

his Message appeareth . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.346

And thus it continued till <font> March <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.347

and then , according to the Plot before laid , <font> Rodolph <$$font>
was dispatched , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.348

and went over indeed . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,104.349

<P_105>

<font> Duke . <$$font> What was deliver'd to <font> Barker <$$font> , I
know not ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.351

that is nothing to me : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.352

I am sure they will not say they deliver'd it me , nor that I receiv'd
any such Letters or Instructions . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.353

This I say , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.354

the Bishop sent me a Letter of the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen's ,
together with a Letter of his own : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.355

In her Letter she complaineth of her own Subjects ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.356

and saith , she will seek other Means for her Relief .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.357

This Letter was decypher'd ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.358

I mislik'd the Device , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.359

and bad that the Letter should be burn'd ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.360

so the Letter in Cypher was burned , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.361

and the Alphabet was sav'd . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.362

I sent word that I mislik'd all those Devices ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.363

and I advis'd the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen to depend only upon the
Queen's Majesty , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.364

or else , if she would take any other Cause , both I , and all other her
Friends in <font> England <$$font> , would give her over ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.365

and thereupon it was that I said , that the Queen , if she fell to such
Practices , would publish her Letters and Doings to her Infamy . Upon
which my Words , the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> excus'd himself ,
and laid all this Matter , of this new Device , to <font> Beyton
<$$font> and <font> Rowley <$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.366

It is not true that <font> Barker <$$font> made me privy to any such
Message or Instructions , as hath been alledg'd .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.367

Also he is not to be allow'd for a Witness against me ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.368

for he hath confessed Treason against himself ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.369

and Persons outlaw'd or attainted of Treason , are no sufficient
Witnesses . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.370

<font> Catlin . <$$font> My Lord , there is none of these Witnesses ,
that have declar'd Matter against you , outlaw'd , or attainted of
Treason , or yet indicted . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.371

<font> Duke . <$$font> They are worse ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.372

for they have confessed Treason . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.373

<font> Attorney . <$$font> The Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , at
this time , was in Custody , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.374

and these Men also that have confess'd against you , were also kept in
Custody , kept asunder in several Places , and severally examin'd , ,
agreed all in one , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.375

and your own Confessions agree with them : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.376

How can this be imagin'd and false ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.377

All these do testify it with one Consent . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.378

The Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , when he first came to the City ,
was examin'd of these things , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.379

he deny'd all , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.380

he stood in it earnestly ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.381

when questions were asked him , he said , He was an Embassador , and not
so to be dealt with , but to be referr'd to his own Mistress the <font>
Scotish <$$font> Queen . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.382

When he was committed to the <font> Tower <$$font> , and there again
examin'd , seeing things confess'd already ; and by the manner of the
Questions that were ask'd , perceiving some Light that the Truth was
known ; then he confessed also , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.383

and in his Confession doth agree fully with <font> Barker <$$font> and
the rest : which Consent could not possibly be , if the Matter were not
true ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.384

besides that , he hath in his Confession touch'd himself .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.385

<font> Duke . <$$font> They have not agreed in Confession against me ,
that I told them any such thing ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.386

but one of them told another , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.387

and so from hand to hand it went among them .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.388

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Well , you see what is confess'd , and with
what Consent we are at Issue ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.389

here is but your Lordship's Denial ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.390

I leave it to my Lords here to consider of the Proofs .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.391

If you had been a good Subject , being then a Prisoner in your own House
, when such dangerous Matter came to your Understanding , you would have
open'd it , that the Queen's Majesty and her Council might have provided
to withstand them , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.392

but you did it not . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.393

The Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> found flat Treason intended ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.394

<font> Rodolph <$$font> was the Messenger that procured it ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.395

the Duke knew it ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.396

<font> Rodolph <$$font> was referr'd to the Duke's Dispatch , upon the
Conference of the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> and <font> Rodolph
<$$font> about the Matter , and the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen's
Willingness to have him sent about the Matter .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.397

Thus it proceeded : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.398

It was agreed that <font> Rodolph <$$font> should have his Message in
Writing ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.399

and at the same Conference , <font> Barker <$$font> being also among
them , it was agreed , and set down in his Instructions , that his
Message should be this : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.400

He should go to the Pope and the King of <font> Spain <$$font> , in the
Name of the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen and of the Duke of <font>
Norfolk <$$font> , to require of them Money and Men for their Enterprize
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.401

<font> Rodolph <$$font> requir'd to speak with the Duke :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.402

<font> Barker <$$font> brought him to the Duke at <font> Howard-House
<$$font> ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.403

there they talk'd together , the Duke and <font> Rodolph <$$font> a
whole Hour , till it was nine of the Clock at Night .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.404

After this Talk , the Duke deliver'd to <font> Barker <$$font> a Paper ,
saying , that <font> Rodolph <$$font> left it with him ; which Paper
contain'd the Sum of the Treason , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.405

and therein was also a Paper of the Names of divers Noblemen , Knights ,
and Gentlemen in Cipher , whom they counted that they would take the
Duke's part , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.406

but they counted without their Host ; so that there was for every Name a
Cipher , of the which 40 was for the Duke , and 30 for the Lord <font>
Lumley . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.407

Barker <$$font> receiv'd it of the Duke , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.408

and deliver'd it again to <font> Rodolph <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.409

Upon this Cipher of 40 , fell out the understanding of the Treason .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.410

Here was read <font> Barker <$$font> 's Deposition , 10 <font> October
<$$font> , Interr. 8. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.411

<font> Item , Barker <$$font> to the 22 Interr.
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.412

<font> Attorney . <$$font> In this Bill the Duke is proved to be 40 ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.413

the Duke himself hath also confess'd that 40 standeth for his own Name .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.414

<font> Barker <$$font> brought <font> Rodolph <$$font> to the Duke ,
which the Duke also confess'd , and that <font> Barker <$$font> brought
him Instructions for <font> Rodolph <$$font> 's Money .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.415

Here Mr. Treasurer and Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer , sworn , did
testify that <font> Barker <$$font> made all these Confessions freely ,
without Compulsion . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.416

Also Mr. <font> Wilson <$$font> , sworn , did testify the same ; and
that <font> Barker <$$font> was never offer'd Torture , nor was once in
the Prison where the Rack was : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.417

but the Duke said <font> Barker <$$font> saw where his Fellow had been .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.418

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Did not <font> Barker <$$font> bring <font>
Rodolph <$$font> to you at nine of the Clock at Night ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.419

Did he not leave with you Instructions in <font> French ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.420

Duke . <$$font> I confess it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.421

Then was read <font> Barker <$$font> to the 16th .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.422

<font> Attorney . Barker <$$font> came also the second time to the Duke
; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.423

after he was come from the Duke , he said to <font> Barker <$$font> ,
That the Duke and he were agreed of his Journey , and that the Duke
pray'd him to depart with speed . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.424

This Message was to procure Men and Money for the Enterprize of the
Treason ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.425

and on this Message the Duke dispatch'd him .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.426

<font> Duke . <$$font> Touching <font> Rodolph <$$font> 's coming , I
have indeed confess'd that he came to me . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.427

I was in Summer was Twelve-Month bound in Recognizance for 1800 <font>
l. <$$font> to <font> Rodolph <$$font> , for my Lord of <font> Arundel
<$$font> , and for my Brother <font> Lumley <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.428

the Day was pass'd whereby I stood in danger of my Recognizance .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.429

I sent to <font> Rodolph <$$font> to intreat him to cancel my
Recognizance , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.430

and I offer'd to give him twenty Yards of Velvet ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.431

<font> Rodolph <$$font> would not be persuaded ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.432

but desired to speak with me himself , which <font> Barker <$$font>
reported to me . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.433

I was very loth that he should come to me , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.434

for he was in Trouble at my last Trouble , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.435

and so I thought his coming to me would be suspicious .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,105.436

<P_106>

<font> Barker <$$font> promis'd that he would bring him to me secretly ,
and at such a time as it should not be known to make any Suspicion .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.438

So <font> Rodolph <$$font> came to me , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.439

and I did what I could to intreat him about my Recognizance ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.440

and I could not persuade him more , than {I_persuaded_him} to promise
that he would not sue me . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.441

He told me of his Trouble and of his Imprisonment at Mr. <font>
Walsingham <$$font> 's , and what Words Mr. <font> Walsingham <$$font>
gave unto him , also of the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen ; and that he
should deal with the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> for Money for her to
her own use , and for Necessaries , as he had done before .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.442

He pray'd also my Letters in the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen's favour
to the Duke of <font> Alva : <$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.443

I began to mislike him , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.444

and was loth to write ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.445

I sought ways to shift me from him ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.446

I said I was not well at ease ; I could not write , and it was late ,
and so I would not deal . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.447

As for the Bill of Names , I saw none such , till the Letter that came
over from <font> Rodolph <$$font> about <font> Easter <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.448

I deliver'd a Writing to <font> Barker : <$$font>
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.449

I confess it ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.450

but it was about that Matter which I have confess'd already for my
Recognizance ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.451

and so I dealt not with any such Matter as is alledg'd against me ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.452

nor receiv'd any other Instructions , but only as I have said , about my
own Matters . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.453

<font> Attorney . <$$font> My Lord , this is but your own saying ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.454

and it carrieth no Likelihood : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.455

But <font> Barker <$$font> goeth nearer to you ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.456

he telleth you plainly what the Instructions were :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.457

It was to King <font> Philip <$$font> for Men , and to the Pope for
Money . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.458

<font> Duke . Barker <$$font> hath confess'd himself a Traitor ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.459

and therefore is no sufficient Witness against me .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.460

I never knew of any such Bill of Names , nor such Instruction in <font>
French . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.461

Attorney . <$$font> It is sufficiently prov'd .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.462

Now <font> Rodolph <$$font> came to you a second time .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.463

<font> Duke . <$$font> I deny it : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.464

He came no more to me . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.465

<font> Attorney . <$$font> That is not so : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.466

for <font> Barker <$$font> telleth plainly , not only the Time , but
also the several Ways by which he himself brought <font> Rodolph
<$$font> to you . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.467

<font> Duke . <$$font> There be Ways enough ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.468

he might have devised also a_dozen Ways more , if he would , in that
House . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.469

Here was read <font> Barker ad <$$font> 11. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.470

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Lo ! he telleth you which way <font>
Rodolph <$$font> came to you . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.471

<font> Duke . <$$font> So he may devise more Ways when he will .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.472

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Now you shall also hear it confess'd by the
Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , who at the time of his Confession was
in Prison , not knowing what <font> Barker <$$font> had said .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.473

Here was read <font> Rosse <$$font> 's Confession of that Matter .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.474

Here was also read <font> Rosse <$$font> , the sixth of <font> November
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.475

Attorney . <$$font> Here you see how the Duke agreeth with <font>
Barker <$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.476

And there was read <font> Rosse <$$font> more , the sixth of <font>
November <$$font> ; how <font> Rodolph <$$font> made account of his Time
, and of his Return before the Parliament ended .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.477

Then Mr. Attorney made a brief Rehearsal of the Matters contain'd in
those Confessions , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.478

and shew'd the Agreement of <font> Rosse <$$font> and <font> Barker
<$$font> ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.479

and then was read <font> Rosse <$$font> , Fol. 3. touching <font>
Rodolph <$$font> 's Account of his old Soldiers , that he could bring
against the <font> English <$$font> , of the Duke of <font> Medina
<$$font> 's coming , of 7000 <font> Spaniards <$$font> to be spar'd .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.480

Now the Duke had satisfy'd <font> Rodolph <$$font> for his Credit ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.481

and tho' the Duke subscribed not , yet if the Duke were a Christian Man
, he was assured of him , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.482

and so would assure foreign Princes on the Duke's part .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.483

Then was read the Confession of the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , to
the 18th . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.484

Now shall you hear further : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.485

<font> Rodolph <$$font> , before his Voyage , mov'd to have Letters of
Credit , that he might deal with foreign Princes ; whereupon three
Letters were devised , to commend <font> Rodolph <$$font> to the Pope ,
the King of <font> Spain <$$font> , and the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font>
, and to give him Credit in his Message , that he might be able to
procure Aid for the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen , and for the
Advancement of the Catholic Faith . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.486

The Duke answer'd , I am loth to write , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.487

for if I write , the Queen's Majesty hath great Intelligence ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.488

and so if my Writing should come to light , all were marr'd ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.489

and so he would not write . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.490

Then the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , and <font> Barker <$$font> ,
travailed earnestly with him to subscribe the Letters ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.491

but he would not . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.492

Then , at length , it was advised and agreed among them , that if the
Duke should send one to the <font> Spanish <$$font> Embassador , that
the Duke was content to affirm the Letter , and to let it pass in his
Name . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.493

And so the <font> Spanish <$$font> Embassador recommended <font> Rodolph
<$$font> 's Message in the Duke's Name , without the Duke's Subscription
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.494

Here was read the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , ult. <font> Octob.
ad <$$font> 20. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.495

Also <font> Barker <$$font> was read of the same Matter .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.496

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Thus it is plainly prov'd :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.497

and if they say true , as it can@ @not be that they can so agree , if it
were not true ; then can it not be deny'd that the Duke is guilty of all
this Treason . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.498

<font> Duke . <$$font> Here is too much at once for me to answer
without Book ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.499

my Memory is not so good , to run thro' every thing , as they do that
have their Books and their Notes lying before them :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.500

Therefore , I pray you , if I forgot to answer to any thing , remember
me of it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.501

It is said , That there are two or three Witnesses against me ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.502

all this two or three are but one Witness : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.503

for <font> Rodolph <$$font> said it to the Bishop of <font> Rosse
<$$font> , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.504

and of his Mouth the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> told it to <font>
Barker <$$font> , and so from Mouth to Mouth ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.505

they are all but one Witness . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.506

Besides that they have confess'd themselves wholly in Treason ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.507

and now they would bring me in with them too ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.508

and so are no sufficient Witnesses against me .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.509

Note , I pray you , the Advices , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.510

and see how likely they are : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.511

Ten_thousand Men must be landed , whereof three or four_thousand must be
Horsemen ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.512

they must land at <font> Harwich <$$font> , and a Port in my Country ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.513

neither is <font> Harwich <$$font> a Port in my Country :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.514

And I am not of so little Skill , that I would have three or
four_thousand Horsemen land in <font> Essex <$$font> , the unfittest
Place for Horsemen to land in all <font> England <$$font> , a Country
best inhabited of Noblemen , Gentlemen , and other Ability to resist
them : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.515

And who would land Horsemen in <font> Essex <$$font> , a Country all
full of Lanes , Woods , Ditches , and Marshes ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.516

I would have chosen some other Country rather , if I had been so minded
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,106.517

Again , in respect of Religion , I would not have landed them in <font>
Essex <$$font> , that came to destroy Religion , and so should have
<P_107> found but little Assistance . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.518

And would I have brought in Power , or join'd with them to the Overthrow
of Religion ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.519

It hath lately been said by that side , that I could not be recover'd
from my Religion : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.520

I would not be chang'd from my Religion ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.521

I had rather be torn with wild Horses . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.522

Besides that the County of <font> Essex <$$font> , adjoining to the
County of <font> Suffolk <$$font> , is most unfit for that purpose : no
County in <font> England <$$font> more replenish'd with Protestants nor
of better Ability , and none more likely to withstand Papists .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.523

As for moving of Friends , I never dealt to move any Person in the
matter ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.524

I never made Provision for it ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.525

I provided no Armour , Shot , Powder , nor Money ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.526

I made no Friends privy to any such Intent .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.527

Some Presumption it is , that if I had intended any such matter , I
would have made some privy to it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.528

I was no otherwise so destitute of Friends , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.529

I would have provided Armour , Shot , and Powder ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.530

I would have provided Money ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.531

I am sure there was not much Money found . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.532

For Armour , I had not at my house here past eight Armours which were of
Proof , and a_hundred Harquebusses ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.533

and besides this , I bestow'd not 10 <font> l. <$$font> in Armour these
ten Years : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.534

Powder I have not two Barrels ; yea , not above a Barrel in all .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.535

So see the likelihood of their Devices ; no Conference of Friends to
take part ; no Provision of Furniture ; a Country , both in Religion and
Situation , unapt for the Matter . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.536

Where they say <font> Rodolph <$$font> told <font> Barker <$$font> , and
<font> Barker <$$font> told me ; and <font> Barker <$$font> came from
<font> Rosse <$$font> and from <font> Rodolph <$$font> to me , and from
me to <font> Rosse <$$font> , to declare that I was content to affirm
the Letters of Credit , I deny it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.537

As for my Consent , that the <font> Spanish <$$font> Embassador should
affirm the Letters in my Name , how unlikely a thing it is , that I was
content to affirm them , but not to subscribe them ; as if I knew not
how small is the Difference between subscribing and affirming ; and as
if I had such slender Wit . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.538

<font> Rodolph <$$font> never came to me but once ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.539

indeed I heard that <font> Rodolph <$$font> would fain have came
{COM:sic} to me again the second time , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.540

but I would not ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.541

<font> Barker <$$font> earnestly urged it , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.542

but I refus'd . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.543

To please the curious <font> Italian <$$font> Head of <font> Rodolph
<$$font> , they devis'd it among them to deal with the <font> Spanish
<$$font> Embassador . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.544

As for me , I never heard from the <font> Spanish <$$font> Embassador in
the matter ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.545

I never saw him but once at my Lord Treasurer's .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.546

I was angry with <font> Barker <$$font> for going to him in my Name ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.547

and he excus'd it , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.548

and said , he could not otherwise content the Bishop of <font> Rosse
<$$font> and <font> Rodolph : <$$font> and so that affirming of the
Letters was <font> Barker <$$font> 's own doing , and not mine .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.549

I would they might , in our private Examinations , have been brought
face to face with me . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.550

I could have put them in mind of things ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.551

they have confess'd Treason of themselves , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.552

and they would bring me in with them , and lay it on my shoulders .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.553

I am hardly handled , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.554

I have been eighteen Weeks committed , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.555

I can speak with no body ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.556

if I might have had them face to face , and been allow'd to bring forth
my Proofs , I would have brought forth direct Matter and Proofs , and
therewith made them remember themselves . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.557

Consider , I beseech you , what they be that accuse me ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.558

and as for them , they be Persons that have accus'd themselves of
Treason , and so be of no Credit . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.559

As for mine own Examinations , they wholly agree in such sort as I have
here declar'd in mine Answer . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.560

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Your Answer is nothing but bare Denial ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.561

and here are three Witnesses against you , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.562

and all three severally examin'd , have agreed in one ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.563

and <font> Barker <$$font> hath directly confessed ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.564

and if you doubt of Impulsion , you shall hear how willingly and how
freely he confess'd it , because the same Examination was taken before
Sir <font> Thomas Smith <$$font> , and subscrib'd with his Hand :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.565

Mr. <font> Wilson <$$font> upon his Oath declar'd the same to be Sir
<font> Thomas Smith <$$font> 's Hand . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.566

<font> Duke . <$$font> Where it is said , that I should bid them to
write , or should affirm their Writing , it is not true .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.567

Indeed <font> Bannister <$$font> spake to me to write for Money for the
<font> Scotish <$$font> Queen , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.568

and I refused to do it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.569

If I should have dealt in any such matter , I would have trusted one
<font> Bannister <$$font> afore fifteen <font> Barkers <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.570

And as for your number of Witnesses in this manner by Hands one from
another , twenty Witnesses may prove but one Witness .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.571

<font> Attorney . <$$font> You shall hear your own Confession agreeing
with them ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.572

you were content <font> Rodolph <$$font> should use your Name to the
Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> , and that he should assure the Duke you
were a Catholick , and that he should shew Tokens to prove it , for that
you kept Papists in your House , and were a Friend to Papists .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.573

Here was read the Duke's Confession , 10 <font> October , ad interr.
<$$font> 58 . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.574

Here his own Hand confesseth the Matter . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.575

<font> Duke . <$$font> I saw the Instructions indeed ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.576

and this Matter was in it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.577

They sought to have it thought I was a Catholick , to serve their
Purpose , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.578

and did put it in of themselves ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.579

but I allowed it not , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.580

I would rather be torn with wild Horses than forsake my Religion .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.581

<font> Attorney . <$$font> These Instructions remained still in your
custody : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.582

Why did you not burn these , as well as you say that you commanded the
Letter to be burned ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.583

<font> Duke . <$$font> Because it was their writing , and not mine .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.584

<font> Wilb. <$$font> You are content it should be extant ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.585

to what purpose was that , if you mislik'd it ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.586

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Your Lordship shall yet see further a Letter
of the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , written to the <font> Scotish
<$$font> Queen , wherein the whole Plot and Course of Treason is plainly
set out at large ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.587

the Letter came to the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen's hands while my
Lord Steward was there , which my Lord Steward affirmed .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.588

So the Letter was read . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.589

<font> Duke . <$$font> The Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> is no
sufficient Witness against me , for the Causes I have declared .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.590

<font> Attorney . <$$font> I leave his Credit to my Lords here to
consider , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.591

let them weigh it as they see cause . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.592

Now come to consider your own Doings ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.593

since your last Imprisonment , Letters have been conveyed unto you ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.594

and you have sent Letters abroad , by many subtle and secret Ways of
Conveyance . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.595

One Letter you sent out , written with Red-Ocre , wherein plainly
appeareth that you feared the Matter , and that something was confessed
, and that you were afraid of more ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.596

you willed the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> should take all upon him
, because he was an Embassador , and that a Bag of Writings should be
sought out and burned . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.597

Here the Letter written in Red-Ocre was read , which the Duke confessed
to be his own . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.598

<font> Attorney . <$$font> This Letter gave occasion to seek the Bag ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.599

and so were the Writings found under Boards fast nailed ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.600

and thereby was understood that <font> Quarante <$$font> was the Duke ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.601

and so by God's Work broke out the whole Practice of the Treason .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.602

This Letter was directed to nobody . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,107.603

<P_108>

<font> Duke . <$$font> It was written to <font> Bayly <$$font> ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.605

and <font> Bayly <$$font> received it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.606

I can answer this Letter well enough . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.607

Here I am charged with two Matters , for matter of my Confessions , and
for burning the Bags of Letters . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.608

As for that which is there said , that I confessed nothing but what I
saw confessed by others , the truth is , I received a Letter , wherein I
was charged , that I had accused some falsely .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.609

I wrote to satisfy , that I had not accused any of any matter of Treason
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.610

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Where is the Letter whereby you were charged
that you had accused falsely ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.611

<font> Duke . <$$font> I kept it not ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.612

think you I would keep Letters ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.613

Burned Letters do no hurt . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.614

As for burning the Writings in the Bag , it maketh nothing against me in
this Case ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.615

for they were nothing but private Letters of the <font> Scotish <$$font>
Queen's , written before , and when I was last in Trouble , long before
this Matter . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.616

At <font> Bannister <$$font> 's coming up at <font> Easter <$$font> last
, he brought them to me , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.617

and I willed <font> Barker <$$font> to lay them up :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.618

What needeth such searching for elder Matters ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.619

I bad them be made away , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.620

for they were but private Matters between the <font> Scotish <$$font>
Queen and me . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.621

<font> Attorney . <$$font> There was the Letter that disclosed you to
be <font> Quarante <$$font> , whereby the Treason was known :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.622

now here is also another Letter of your own , which you secretly sent
out of the <font> Tower <$$font> , which sheweth your Guiltiness in the
matter of the great Treason with <font> Rodolph <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.623

Here the Duke's other Letter was read . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.624

<font> Duke . <$$font> This was only , as I have declared before , for
my Conference with <font> Rodolph <$$font> , for the Matter of Money ,
both touching mine own Recognizance , and procuring of money for the
<font> Scotish <$$font> Queen , for her Necessity .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.625

<font> Attorney . <$$font> By the whole Course of the Matter that goeth
before , it is for the Treason , and not for the Money .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.626

Here is also another Letter of your own , which carrieth manifest
Presumptions of the Treason , where , among other things , you will
<font> Barker <$$font> to confess no further , if he love his Life :
besides other most manifest suspicious Matters .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.627

<font> Duke . <$$font> I wrote it not in respect of any fear that
<font> Barker <$$font> could hurt me , when I willed that <font> Barker
<$$font> should confess no more , as he loved his Life :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.628

For indeed he might touch himself in Treason , <paren> as he hath done
<$$paren> but not me , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.629

for I never consented to it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.630

<font> Attorney . <$$font> Now shall you see how the Matter proceeded
further : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.631

After the dispatch of <font> Rodolph <$$font> , in <font> Lent <$$font>
last , as he had made shew before , that he intended to go over Sea ,
and was all this while practising about this Treason ; at length being
frighted with these Messages , he came to sue to the Queen's Majesty for
a Pass-port , which was granted him , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.632

and he carried over two Geldings with him , which is evident Proof that
he went over . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.633

Now shall you see what effect it took , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.634

and by the Answer you shall discern the Message and Practice :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.635

Being beyond the Sea , and having done his Message , he sent
Advertisement to the Duke how he sped , and likewise from {COM:sic} the
Pope ; which plainly discloseth the whole Purpose and Plot of the
Treason , as shall be declared unto your Lordships .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.636

Here began Mr. Sollicitor . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.637

<font> Sollicitor . <$$font> For that the time is spent , and your
Lordships , I think , are weary , I will not now make any Collection
what hath been gathered of the attempt of Marriage with the <font>
Scotish <$$font> Queen , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.638

only I will deal with the Matter of <font> Rodolph <$$font> 's Message ,
and the effect thereof : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.639

And the Duke's adhering to the Queen's Enemies and Rebels , shall be
another part . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.640

In this Matter of <font> Rodolph <$$font> , hath been laid before you a
plain Plot for a Rebellion , and for Invasion of the Realm , set forth
in the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen's Letter , which was deciphered by
<font> Hickford <$$font> , by the Duke's Commandment , as hath been said
unto you ; the effect whereof was as hath been declared .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.641

And here he repeated the Effect of that Letter , containing the Device
of putting Men into the Field , and to seize the <font> Scotish <$$font>
Queen . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.642

Now if the Device were follow'd , and if the Duke were a Doer in it , if
he were a Consenter unto it , if <font> Rodolph <$$font> were practised
with for the Journey , if he received his Message to that end , if he
went and pursued it , if he sent Answer accordingly ; then it must needs
be that here is matter of High-Treason , and the Duke of <font> Norfolk
<$$font> guilty of it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.643

It hath been shewed by the Declaration of <font> Barker <$$font> , and
of the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , how <font> Rodolph <$$font> was
the Pope's Factor , was commended by the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen
for a fit Messenger in this Matter , was conferred with about it ,
Articles were devised , they were shewed the Duke , and the Duke himself
hath confessed that he spake with <font> Rodolph <$$font> , and that he
saw the Instructions . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.644

Now is the question , How far the Instuctions extended , whether to
matter of High-Treason , as hath been alledged , or no ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.645

The Duke saith for his excuse , That the Instructions were but for a
private cause of Money , and that when <font> Rodolph <$$font> required
him to write his Letters , the Duke refused and cast him off .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.646

See how this accordeth : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.647

If it were but a private Cause , whereto served that refusal to write ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.648

As well he might by Letters , as by Instructions , pursued in a private
Cause . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.649

What needeth that secret coming in the Night-time about a private Cause
? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.650

The Duke himself confesseth , that the Instructions were shewed him
before <font> Rodolph <$$font> came to him ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.651

he confesseth also that <font> Rodolph <$$font> was commended by the
<font> Scotish <$$font> Queen ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.652

the Instructions have here been shewed , containing the Matter of his
Journey , and extending to the Treason : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.653

He came to confer with the Duke . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.654

Now let your Lordships judge why , and about what Matters they conferred
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.655

The Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> and <font> Barker <$$font> do , of
their own knowledge , declare , how , for Furniture of this Message ,
there were Letters of Credit devised in the name of the <font> Scotish
<$$font> Queen and the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> , to the Pope ,
the <font> Spanish <$$font> King , and the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font>
; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.656

the Duke refused to subscribe them , for fear , if he should deal too
openly , the Treason might perhaps to some appear :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.657

therefore a Device was found out how to salve the matter , That he
should , by his Servant , affirm the Letters to the <font> Spanish
<$$font> Embassador , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.658

and so they should , by the <font> Spanish <$$font> Embassador's
Commendation , pass with as good credit as if they had been subscribed .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.659

This Device was performed , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.660

his Assent was witnessed , and the Letters of credit confirm'd
accordingly . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.661

<font> Rodolph <$$font> went over to the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> ,
and from thence to the Pope ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.662

he return'd answer of his Message , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.663

and gave Advertisement to the Duke . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.664

Did not he send his answer concerning the very Instructions that have
been alledg'd , and the matter of Treason , and not of a private Cause ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.665

And to whom ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.666

Sent he not answer to the Duke , by the name of <font> Quarante <$$font>
? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,108.667

Would <font> Rodolph <$$font> make answer <P_109> to , and advertise him
that never sent him , and of a Matter that he never sent him about ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.668

By this you may see the intent of the Message .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.669

Now shall you see what Answer was return'd .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.670

The Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , after this , sent over a Servant
of his , one <font> Charles Bayly <$$font> , to fetch certain Books that
were printed in those Parts ; Books containing very seditious Matter ,
whereof I have seen some , by permission , tending to these ends .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.671

First , therein is conveyed to the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen a Title
to the Crown of <font> England <$$font> , a Descent above the Conquest ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.672

and so labouring to impair the Interest of all our Kings that have
reigned since the Conquest . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.673

Then the Judgment of the Right of the Crown of this Realm is reduc'd to
an universal Law , which they call <font> Jus Gentium <$$font> , and the
discerning thereof exempted from the Laws of this Realm .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.674

And of that universal Law they establish one universal Judge , whom they
insinuate to be the Pope , whose Bulls you see have pass'd in prejudice
of the Queen's Majesty's undoubted Right . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.675

This <font> Charles Bayly <$$font> being in those parts for this
occasion of the Books , met with <font> Rodolph <$$font> at <font>
Brussels <$$font> , after that <font> Rodolph <$$font> had had his
dispatch from the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> , and was hasting to the
Pope ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.676

and therefore having haste of his Journey , and much to write , and
small leisure , he desired <font> Charles Bayly <$$font> to write for
him two Letters for two Noblemen of this Realm , both in Cipher :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.677

but to whom the Letters were directed , <font> Charles <$$font> himself
could not tell ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.678

for <font> Rodolph <$$font> subscrib'd the Letters himself , one to
<font> Quarante <$$font> , the other to <font> Trente .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.679

Charles Bayly <$$font> bringing their Books and Letters , was taken at
<font> Dover <$$font> , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.680

the Books were brought to the Council , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.681

the Pacquet of Letters were convey'd away to the Bishop of <font> Rosse
: <$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.682

And daily more and more grew the Suspicion , by reason of the repair of
the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> 's Servants to the <font> Marshalsea
<$$font> , where <font> Charles <$$font> was .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.683

At length there were Letters taken between the Bishop of <font> Rosse
<$$font> and <font> Charles <$$font> , mentioning the recovery of <font>
Rodolph <$$font> 's Pacquet . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.684

In this Pacquet was the Advertisement of the Success of the Voyage ,
from <font> Rodolph <$$font> to the Duke , by the name of 40 .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.685

This Letter of <font> Rodolph <$$font> 's was sent to the Duke from the
Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> by <font> Barker <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.686

<font> Barker <$$font> deliver'd it to the Duke , from whence it was
sent back again to the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> by <font> Gutbert
<$$font> , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.687

and by <font> Gutbert <$$font> it was deciphered , and carried again to
the Duke by <font> Barker : <$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.688

Upon this occasion <font> Gutbert <$$font> was sought for ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.689

the Duke convey'd him away , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.690

and this conveying away of <font> Gutbert <$$font> , the Duke hath
confessed . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.691

If this be thus , then must it needs be that <font> Rodolph <$$font> was
sent by him , and to such end as the Letter bringeth answer of .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.692

In the Letter , this was contain'd , That <font> Rodolph <$$font> had
spoken with the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> ; That he had very good and
loving Alliance ; That the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> lovingly
promis'd all the help he could ; and that he would commend the Cause to
the King of <font> Spain <$$font> his Master :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.693

And he advised <font> Rodolph <$$font> to go forward to the Pope ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.694

and that he said he could not do further without more Warrant , which he
would seek to procure . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.695

Also certain questions were ask'd by the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> ;
as , What Fort was between the Haven where they should land and <font>
London ? <$$font> How near <font> London <$$font> it was ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.696

So the nearness of <font> London <$$font> was respected , how
incommodious soever your Lordship saith the Place was for Horsemen .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.697

These Questions belike depended upon the Matter propounded , which touch
the Plot of the Treason , and not a private Cause , as your Lordship
pretendeth . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.698

The Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> confesseth the receipt of these
Letters , and the deciphering of them . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.699

So <font> Charles Bayly <$$font> , by <font> Rodolph <$$font> 's Request
, wrote the two Letters in Ciphers ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.700

<font> Rodolph <$$font> himself directed them to 40 and 30 .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.701

<font> Charles <$$font> being taken , and confessing the writing , and
bringing of these Letters , and the Matter contain'd in them in <font>
April <$$font> last , yet knew not who was 40 or 30 .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.702

This was strangely convey'd , Treason known in Matter , and yet the
Person not known to himself that wrote it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.703

Here was read <font> Charles Bayly <$$font> 's Confession , <font> ad
<$$font> 3. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.704

<font> Sollic. <$$font> Now you see to what End the Effect of the
Message tended ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.705

you see what it was , and how it was done ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.706

you see how it was receiv'd , and the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> 's
Questions upon it : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.707

now you shall see the Contents of the Answer , by the Examinations of
the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , and <font> Barker <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.708

the receipt of the Letters of Answer the Duke himself hath confessed .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.709

<font> Duke . <$$font> Where they say this Message was sent by my
Privity , by reason that I was meant by 40 , I deny it ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.710

I never wrote by <font> Rodolph <$$font> , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.711

I refus'd to do it , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.712

I knew not his Letters were to me , but as <font> Barker <$$font> said :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.713

And it was not likely they should be to me ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.714

for it was a Matter which I was not privy of , and in a Cipher which I
had not ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.715

<font> Rodolph <$$font> left no Cipher with me .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.716

As for the taking of the Pacquet , I knew nothing of it ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.717

the Letter I never saw in Cipher ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.718

<font> Barker <$$font> brought me a Decipher , telling me , That 40 was
for me , and 30 for the Queen of <font> Scots <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.719

When he told me first he had the Cipher , I ask'd what I should do with
it , and how I should read it , having no Cipher ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.720

<font> Barker <$$font> answered , that it was left with <font> Gutbert
<$$font> ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.721

for <font> Rodolph <$$font> , at his departure , had told him , That he
would write answer of the Money for the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen ,
and that he would leave the Cipher with <font> Gutbert <$$font> ; and
that he had so done , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.722

and in the Letters deciphered did appear , that the Duke of <font> Alva
<$$font> had promised aid of Money for the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen
for her Necessities ; but he could not yet do it for want of Commission
, but as soon as he had Commission he would .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.723

When I heard of this I mislik'd this dealing with the Duke of <font>
Alva <$$font> , having before refus'd to write to him in the Matter at
<font> Rodolph <$$font> 's Request ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.724

and I threatned <font> Barker <$$font> if he so dealt any more with me .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.725

The Letters might be to me , as <font> Barker <$$font> said ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.726

but I knew not so much . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.727

<font> Sollic. <$$font> This your Answer is in all no more than a bare
denying , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.728

and so be all your Speeches , all upon your own Credit only .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.729

Here was read <font> Barker <$$font> 's Confession , ad <$$font> 2 , & 3
, concerning <font> Rodolph <$$font> 's Letters in Cipher , and the
Deciphering by <font> Gutbert <$$font> , and the Port where the <font>
Walloons <$$font> should have landed , & <font> c <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.730

Then was read the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> 's to the 12 and 13 ,
to the same effect . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.731

Then Mr. Sollicitor recited again the Effect of the Letters , and the
said Confessions of <font> Rosse <$$font> and <font> Barker <$$font> ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.732

and proceeded further thus : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.733

You see all these agree in one concerning the Contents of the Letter ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,109.734

now the Letter being deciphered by <font> Gutbert <$$font> , and <font>
Gutbert <$$font> being able to discover the whole , this <font> Gutbert
<$$font> , when he was sent for by the Council , <P_110> was convey'd
away by the Duke's means , as the Duke himself hath confessed .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.735

<font> Duke . <$$font> It may be <font> Barker <$$font> received this
Letter as you spake of , and that <font> Gutbert <$$font> deciphered it
, and that it contain'd the Matters that you alledge ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.736

it may be that they kept that Letter still to themselves , and might
bring me another Letter , containing only such Matter as I was contented
with , containing the private Cause . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.737

<font> Sollic. <$$font> An unlikely matter ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.738

but thus you see the Duke confesseth the Receipt of the Letter ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.739

he only denieth that it was to this effect .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.740

It was confessed , that a Letter to this effect was written to 40 ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.741

he also confesseth , that 40 was for the Duke himself .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.742

The Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> 's Questions prov'd the form of the
matter ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.743

the Duke read that Letter . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.744

<font> Duke . <$$font> I read not that Letter , but of another Matter ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.745

and you bring but one Witness to prove it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.746

<font> Sollic. <$$font> There be two Witnesses , <font> Barker <$$font>
and the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , severally examined , who
agreed directly , expressing it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.747

And <font> Bayly <$$font> also wrote the Letter himself containing the
Treason , and not knowing to whom the Letter was directed , accordeth
with them . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.748

<font> Duke . Barker <$$font> and <font> Gutbert <$$font> might make
the Letter themselves , and put in and out what they list .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.749

<font> Sollic. <$$font> Why did <font> Rodolph <$$font> write you a
Letter at all ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.750

<font> Duke . <$$font> I know not . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.751

<font> Barker <$$font> presented me the Letters out of Cipher ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.752

and I had not the Cipher , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.753

nor saw any such Letter as you alledge . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.754

<font> Sollic. <$$font> It appeareth further , how after this dispatch
with the Duke of <font> Alva , Rodolph <$$font> went forward on his
Message to the Pope ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.755

and having also good Success there , he so advertis'd again .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.756

The Pope sent Letters to the Duke and the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen
, to this effect , That he liked well of their Enterprizes , & <font> c
<$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.757

Would <font> Rodolph <$$font> have gone to the Pope and procur'd Letters
, if he had not had Instructions accordingly ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.758

The Duke himself hath confessed such a Letter , conceived there came
Letters , both of one Tenour ; the one by the way of <font> France
<$$font> , the other by the way of <font> Flanders : <$$font>
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.759

the effect you have heard , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.760

and the Receipt is confessed . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.761

<font> Duke . Barker <$$font> indeed brought me about six or seven
Lines , written in a Roman Hand in <font> Latin <$$font> , beginning
thus , <font> Dilecte fili , salutem <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.762

I asked what it was ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.763

and <font> Barker <$$font> told me , it was a Letter from the Pope to me
: Wherewith I was offended , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.764

and said , A Letter to me from the Pope ! THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.765

What have I to do with him , that is Enemy to my Religion and Country ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.766

How cometh this to pass ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.767

So I received it , and not otherwise : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.768

and <font> Barker <$$font> excus'd it , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.769

and said , That <font> Rodolph <$$font> had procur'd it for his own
Credit . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.770

Here was read <font> Barker , ad <$$font> 29 .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.771

<font> Sollic. <$$font> Thus you see the Effect of this Letter , and
how this was directed to the Duke from <font> Rodolph <$$font> , also by
the name of 40 , deciphered by <font> Gutbert <$$font> , and delivered
to the Duke by <font> Barker <$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.772

The Duke received it THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.773

and read it , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.774

and said , <font> Rodolph <$$font> hath been at <font> Rome <$$font> ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.775

I perceive there will nothing be done this year .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.776

By this it appeareth , that he reproved not <font> Barker <$$font> at
all for bringing it unto him , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.777

for <font> Barker <$$font> brought it him twice :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.778

Would he have brought it him the second time , if the Duke had been
angry with him for it at the first ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.779

<font> Duke . <$$font> I knew not at the first time what it was ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.780

for it was in Cipher . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.781

Then was read <font> Barker <$$font> 's Confession to the 8th .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.782

<font> Duke . Barker <$$font> is not of Credit ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.783

he accuseth me falsely . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.784

<font> Sollic. <$$font> He was your Servant , and of near Place and
Credit about you ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.785

why should he accuse you wrongfully ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.786

<font> Duke . <$$font> He was not of Credit about me ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.787

for I used him not this fourteen Years . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.788

<font> Sollic. <$$font> That is not so , as hath well appeared .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.789

Besides this , the conveying away of <font> Gutbert <$$font> , which was
done by your means , and who deciphered this Letter , and could have
disclosed the Matter , proveth a great Guiltiness in you .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.790

<font> Duke . <$$font> He was convey'd away at his own Request made ,
and not for my Safety . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.791

<font> Sollic. <$$font> You caused him to be convey'd away ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.792

and were privy to his conveying . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.793

<font> Duke . Barker <$$font> removed him : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.794

indeed I was not privy . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.795

<font> Sollic. <$$font> You moved <font> Bowes <$$font> to join with
<font> Barker <$$font> to do it . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.796

Then Mr. Sollicitor said further to the Peers , I have also , my Lords
, one thing more to say to you from the Queen's Majesty's own Mouth :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.797

The Lords that be here of the Privy-Council do know it very well , not
meet here in open Presence to be uttered , because it toucheth others
that are not here now to be named ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.798

but by her Highness's Order , we pray that their Lordships will impart
it unto you more particularly . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.799

In <font> Flanders <$$font> , by the Embassador of a foreign Prince ,
there the whole Plot of this Treason was discovered , and by a Servant
of his brought to her Majesty's Intelligence ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.800

the Minister not meaning to conceal so foul and dishonourable a Practice
, gave Intelligence hither by Letters , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.801

and hath therein disclosed the whole Treason in such Form as hath here
been proved unto you : Wherefore I refer the more particular Declaration
thereof to the Peers of the Privy-Council . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.802

Then began Mr. <font> Wilbraham <$$font> , Attorney of the Wards ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.803

and said to this effect . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.804

<font> Wilbraham . <$$font> There is yet something unspoken ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.805

it consisteth in two Points , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.806

I will be short in both . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.807

The Matters are plain , and easy to understand .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.808

Let my Lord answer , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.809

and your Lordships shall easily judge of them .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.810

Here have been set forth before you the imagining and practising of the
Deprivation and Death of the Queen's Majesty , with bringing in of
Strangers into the Realm to invade , and levy War , with the
Appurtenances both miserable and many . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.811

This Request I am now to make , that for proof of these Treasons , that
I will intreat you to have in memory what hath before been said ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.812

for tho' the Proofs of these Treasons we divide to several Parts , for
Ease and Shortness , as the seeking of the Marriage , <font> Rodolph
<$$font> 's Voyage , the Success thereof , and the Residence that
remaineth , ought all to be compared together ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.813

any one appearing plainly true , giveth Credit to the rest .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.814

The Queen's Majesty's Proceeding in this Trial is very honourable , mild
, and gracious ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.815

the Confessions have been made by the Parties freely , without Torture
or Constraint . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,110.816

You shall see each of them , and each part so prove the other , as the
whole shall be clearly out of doubt ; Where the Earl of <font>
Northumberland <$$font> and his Wife , the Earl of <font> Westmoreland ,
Richard Norton <$$font> , and others in the North Parts raised
Rebellions , and levy'd open War against the Queen's Majesty within her
Realm ; and being overthrown by the Queen's Power , fled into <font>
Scotland <$$font> , and there were received by the Duke of <font>
Chastelleroy <$$font> , the Lord <font> Harris <$$font> , the Lord
<font> Hume <$$font> , the Lord <font> Buccleugh <$$font> , and others ,
and by them were comforted <P_111> and detained against the Queen's
Majesty , requiring to have them delivered .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.817

Her Majesty being denied to have them restored , publish'd and
proclaim'd open War against those Detainers of her Rebels ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.818

and appointed the Earl of <font> Sussex <$$font> her Lieutenant-General
, with an Army to invade <font> Scotland <$$font> , and there to pursue
those her Enemies , sparing the rest . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.819

He entered into the Land , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.820

made open War upon them , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.821

blew up their Houses with Powder , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.822

wasted their Countries , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.823

and drove the Rebels out of <font> Scotland <$$font> .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.824

The one Matter now that I am to disclose , is , That the Duke of <font>
Norfolk <$$font> knowing all this , yet did adhere unto , comforted and
relieved the said Rebels ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.825

he procured Money to be distributed to the Earl of <font> Westmoreland
<$$font> , the Countess of <font> Northumberland <$$font> , and other of
them ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.826

and this is manifest Treason . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.827

The other Matter is , That the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> knowing
all this to be true , adhered unto , comforted , and relieved the said
Lords of <font> Scotland <$$font> , the Queen's Enemies , Receivers and
Detainers of her Rebels ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.828

and this is also Treason . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.829

And first for the aiding of the Rebels : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.830

After this Rebellion , and their Overthrow by the Queen's Power , they
fled into <font> Scotland <$$font> , <paren> a very bare Country
<$$paren> where they were driven to hard Shifts ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.831

so were they enforced to sue to the Pope for help ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.832

they wrote to him , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.833

the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen wrote in their favour to the Pope's
Nuncio , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.834

the Matter was pursued for them by one <font> D. Morton : <$$font>
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.835

this <font> Morton <$$font> was he that was the Procurer of the Bull
that was sent over against the Queen's Majesty ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.836

this <font> Morton <$$font> was he that reconciled the Earl of <font>
Northumberland <$$font> to the <font> Romish <$$font> Church , by a Bull
of Absolution : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.837

he went to the Pope on their Message ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.838

the Pope granted them Relief , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.839

and wrote Letters in the mean time to comfort them , which were directed
thus ; Thomae & Carolo Northumbriae & Westmorlandiae <font> Comitibus ,
reliquisque Nobilibus Catholicis partium Borealium Regni <$$font>
Angliae : <font> To <$$font> Thomas <font> and <$$font> Charles , <font>
Earls of <$$font> Northumberland <font> and <$$font> Westmoreland ,
<font> and other of the Catholick Noblemen of the North Parts of the
Realm of <$$font> England . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.840

Belike , so calling them noble in the fulfilling of <font> D. Story
<$$font> 's Promise , that by their rebellious Enterprize they were now
of Worshipful become Honourable . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.841

Here was read the Effect of the Pope's Letters to the Rebels .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.842

The Letters hereof came to the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.843

the Money was assigned in <font> Flanders <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.844

the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> sent to the Duke of <font> Norfolk
<$$font> for his Advice , and for his Help to convey the Money to them .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.845

The Bishop thought it best to have the Money sent by the West-Borderers
, where the Lord <font> Harris <$$font> was , and with him <font>
Leonard Davis : <$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.846

the Duke , for their special displeasures to <font> Leonard Davis
<$$font> , was not willing that <font> Leonard Davis <$$font> should
have part of it ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.847

but had more mind to have his Brother of <font> Westmoreland <$$font>
relieved , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.848

and to that end he devised with <font> Bannister <$$font> for the
sending of the Money . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.849

In the mean time , behold how that course was interrupted :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.850

The Queen's Majesty had a Treaty with the Queen of <font> Scots <$$font>
, wherein one special Article was , That the Rebels should be delivered
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.851

This the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen was loth
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.852

and liked not to do ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.853

she asked the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> 's Counsel in it ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.854

he advised that in no wise they should be delivered ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.855

for that were too much against her Honour : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.856

nevertheless , for that he feared that the Article concerning the
delivery of the Rebels might be some stay to such conclusion , as
otherwise they might have liked of , he gave advice that the Rebels
should depart out of <font> Scotland . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.857

Rosse <$$font> wrote to them to that end , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.858

and therewith sent them the Pope's Letters , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.859

and so they all departed out of <font> Scotland <$$font> into <font>
Flanders <$$font> , except only <font> Leonard Davis <$$font> , who
remained with the Lord <font> Harris <$$font> and the Earl of <font>
Northumberland <$$font> , who would also fain have been gone if he might
; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.860

and so by this occasion , and by <font> Bannister <$$font> 's means ,
was this sending of the Money into <font> Scotland <$$font> disappointed
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.861

Then was there another Device taken , to distribute it in <font>
Flanders <$$font> : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.862

and because it should not all be suddenly wasted , it was agreed by the
Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> , that it should be distributed monthly
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.863

This Order was opened to the Duke by <font> Barker <$$font> ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.864

the Duke liked well of it , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.865

and willed it to be done accordingly . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.866

A Man was sent over for this purpose , and the Money distributed .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.867

The Countess of <font> Northumberland <$$font> wrote over to the Bishop
of <font> Rosse <$$font> a Letter of Thanks .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.868

Hereupon report was made to the Duke , that it was done as he had
appointed . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.869

Now the Duke will ask us , What proof we have hereof ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.870

We say , The Confessions of <font> Rosse <$$font> and <font> Barker
<$$font> . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.871

Against this he taketh exception ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.872

his only answer is his bare denial , and his defacing of their Credit .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.873

He saith they are Traitors , and have confessed Treason against
themselves , and not to be received for sufficient Witnesses against him
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.874

This hath been well answered already by my Lords the Justices , that by
the Law they are sufficient Witnesses . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.875

You may not stand upon your Honour and difference of Degree , and
thereby limit how far they are to be credited .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.876

But now let us examine their Credit , and their likeliness to tell Truth
, and how meet in this Case they are to be believed .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.877

First , For the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.878

he is a wise Man , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.879

he is learned , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.880

he is a Bishop , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.881

he is an Embassador , a great Friend to the Duke of <font> Norfolk
<$$font> ; so far in Credit with the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen ,
that he hath been the principal Doer of all her Affairs ; so the fittest
Man for this Treason , the meetest Man to be used in it , since the
<font> Scotish <$$font> Queen's Title is the ground of the Treason .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.882

Who then but such a Man was fit to be used ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.883

Who meeter to be heard in such a matter than he ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.884

A <font> Scot <$$font> , a wise Man , well acquainted with the matters ,
well able to deal in them , ever at hand , and every way the meetest Man
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.885

He was a <font> Scot <$$font> , say you ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.886

the more to blame the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> to deal so with
him , against the express Commandment of his Sovereign upon his
Allegiance , and against his own Faith , Submission , and Promise , and
so himself unworthier Man to be believed than the <font> Scotish
<$$font> Witness . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.887

Why should the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> accuse him falsely ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.888

What should move him to it ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.889

He accuseth you , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.890

he also proveth it against you ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.891

he is the aptest Man to know it , the aptest of all other to repeat it .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.892

And why will you say he is so oft produc'd for every matter against you
? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.893

Surely great Cause , great Difference between him and all other ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.894

he knew all ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.895

he dealt in all , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.896

and where the rest had every one but his Part to play , the Bishop of
<font> Rosse <$$font> continually kept the Stage ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.897

he had a long Part , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.898

he answered all Men ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.899

when every Man brought forth their Tallies , he kept the Stocks of all ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.900

he speaketh of that he understandeth , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.901

he speaketh credibly , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.902

he carrieth Proof and Consent of other . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.903

Speaketh he of Malice against the Duke ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.904

That can@ @not be , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.905

the Duke never offended him ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.906

the Duke was ever his greatest Friend , and he the greatest Friend to
the Duke , and the chief Advancer of the Marriage that the Duke so
earnestly sought , as most beneficial ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,111.907

he hath in his Confession touched his own Mistress , upon whom <P_112>
he depended , to whom he ought no Malice ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.908

he hath disclosed the Treacheries of the Pope ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.909

him he hath offended , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.910

he gets no more Benefices at his hand ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.911

he hath offended the King of <font> Spain <$$font> and the Duke of
<font> Alva <$$font> , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.912

he is fallen out with all his Friends , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.913

he is fallen from all his commodious Hopes by his Confession .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.914

Besides that , How hath he told it ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.915

Not at the first as of Malice , and desirous to do the Duke a shrewd
turn ; but with leisure , after other former Confessions .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.916

He held off , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.917

and disclosed nothing , till his Face <paren> tho' it were a Face of
Brass <$$paren> could no longer withstand apparent Truth disclosed by
others ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.918

except he had been mad and a stark Fool , as he is very wise , he would
not have thrust himself into all those Hardinesses , to tell an untruth
to his own so great Loss and Hindrance . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.919

Would he , being wise , for Malice to the Duke of <font> Norfolk
<$$font> , undo his own Mistress the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen ; and
bring upon himself the hatred of the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> , the
<font> Spanish <$$font> King , and the Pope ; and so lose all his
Friends , and make them his Foes , and indanger himself , and undo
himself , with confessing Treason against himself , for only Malice of
the Duke of <font> Norfolk ? <$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.920

It can@ @not be true ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.921

I must needs believe him , because it is Treason that he speaketh of the
Man's own Faculty : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.922

He is a credible Traitor . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.923

If he had told us a matter of Virtue , good Life , and true Religion ,
it had been a Vanity to hear the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> speak ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.924

but speaking of Treason , he is the skilfullest Man , and meetest to be
heard . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.925

As for <font> Hickford <$$font> and <font> Bannister <$$font> , they be
both still in Credit , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.926

the Duke excepteth not against them , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.927

and yet they accuse him deeply . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.928

For comparison of their Values and Credit , the Duke is noble ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.929

and these are said not able to spend five Marks .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.930

What then ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.931

Indeed their Honour is less , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.932

but their Understanding is great , and their Credit sufficient .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.933

<font> Barker <$$font> is misliked , and counted by the Duke not worthy
to be believed . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.934

It is misliked that he is still brought forth ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.935

he is as the base Instrument still play'd on .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.936

There is good cause why the Duke so continually used him :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.937

You must understand that things must be done by Means and Instruments :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.938

The Heads need the Service of inferior Members ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.939

the Heads do devise , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.940

the Hands and the Feet do put in execution .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.941

If the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> should , for every Message and
Matter to be treated with the Bishop of <font> Rosse , Rodolph <$$font>
, and the <font> Spanish <$$font> Embassador , or other , have himself
trotted thro' dirty <font> Smithfield <$$font> , and the Streets of
<font> London <$$font> , unto <font> Thames-street <$$font> , and other
Places , it must needs have been wondered at ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.942

and would not have been without notable Suspicion .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.943

But <font> Barker <$$font> , a sly Fellow , sufficient for Skill ,
exercised in the Matters , acquainted with the Practices , might well go
dreaming to all Places without Suspicion . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.944

Sometimes upon Robbery or a shrewd Turn done , the length of a Foot in
the Snow , or in the Mire , hath betrayed the Doer ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.945

so the Foot may sometimes accuse the Head . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.946

<font> Barker <$$font> was one of the Duke's Secretaries , privy to his
greatest Affairs , the Writer of his Ciphers , the common Carrier of
ciphered and deciphered Letters , the common Conveyer and Sender of his
Messages and Letters between him and the Queen of <font> Scots :
<$$font> THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.947

The Duke himself agreeth with them in confessing of sundry Circumstances
of the Matters , which he calleth his Errors and inferior Faults ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.948

with these Men he dealt in them himself , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.949

gave them Credit , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.950

therefore it is no reason himself should take from them the Credit of
their Confessions . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.951

But he saith there are but two of them ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.952

the Fault is in the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> there are no more ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.953

for there are {COM:sic} more if they were here ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.954

and by the Duke's means they are absent : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.955

<font> Liggons , Gutbert <$$font> , and <font> Rodolph <$$font> could
tell it also . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.956

The one of them , <font> Liggons <$$font> , he hath sent away ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.957

and findeth him in <font> France . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.958

Gutbert <$$font> , as the Duke himself hath confessed , the Duke hath
caused to be carried away . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.959

<font> Rodolph <$$font> is , by the Duke himself , sent out of the Realm
on his Message , and not return'd THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.960

<paren> it is no reason that their absence excuse him <$$paren> ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.961

for it is not reason that he should take advantage of his own Wrong ,
that hath made them absent ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.962

so their absence must stand for great Testimony against him , and be
judged to concur with them that are present , and have confessed .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.963

<font> Rodolph <$$font> , the greatest Testimony of all , is in Person
withdrawn ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.964

but his Letters speak lively . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.965

He hath testified by his Letters against the Duke , and of a matter that
himself well knew , not constrained , not examined , but with the Tenor
and Course of the Proceeding of the Treason , advertising the Duke of
the answer of his Message . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.966

You say he dealt for you in other private Matters , not in the Treason :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.967

If that were so , then the Pope had not given him charge to deal with
the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen and you ; the <font> Scotish <$$font>
Queen had not commended him to you ; the Instructions had not been so
penned ; the Answer had not been so return'd .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.968

But saith the Duke , It is true , <font> Rodolph <$$font> talked with me
indeed , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.969

he required my Letters to the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> , for the
<font> Scotish <$$font> Queen ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.970

he moved me about these matters ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.971

but I was angry with him , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.972

I would not write by him , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.973

I departed from him in anger , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.974

and thus in anger away he went . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.975

And whither went he ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.976

Even strait to the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> , and from thence to the
Pope , even to the same Places and Persons to whom he should have gone
for the Duke , if the Duke had been without anger , best pleased and
contented with his Journey . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.977

To what Intent , and of what Message went he thither ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.978

Even the same that the Duke said he was angry to be moved of , and
refused to write in . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.979

What effect hath it ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.980

Gentle Audience , great Promises and Agreement to the Requests , as if
he had travailed not for a Man angry at the matter , but most desirous .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.981

What Answer return'd he ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.982

Even the same that accordeth with the Instructions concerning the
Treason , the very Plat and Ground of his Message .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.983

He reporteth Questions asked by the Duke of <font> Alva <$$font> ,
agreeing only with the matter of the Treason , and no private Case .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.984

Would he have written answer to him that sent him not ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.985

Would he have written as to please him with good News of a good Audience
that sent him not ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.986

From whence departed he in anger ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.987

He writeth of the Course to be kept in Execution of the Treason , which
he would not have done to him that was angry to hear of it .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.988

He braggeth of his 10000 <font> Walloons <$$font> , old beaten Soldiers
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.989

If the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> had been a true Man , and angry
with the matter , as he now saith , and done his Duty ; tho' they had
come , his <font> Walloons <$$font> , his old beaten Soldiers , might
have been so new beaten of the old <font> English <$$font> Fashion , as
they were never so swinged in their Lives . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.990

This Point Mr. Attorney spake with such a Grace , such Chearfulness of
Heart and Voice , as if he had been ready to be one at the doing of it ;
like a hearty true <font> Englishman <$$font> , a good Christian , a
good Subject , a Man enough for his Religion , Prince and Country .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,112.991

<P_113>

If the Duke says it was the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen's Message only
, and not his <paren> for advancement of her wrongful Claim by force
<$$paren> he knowing this , Why sought he to marry her against the
Queen's Majesty's Will , and to pursue it by force ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.993

If he say it was <font> Barker <$$font> 's single Device , to send these
Messages , to procure these Treasons , and work all these Mischiefs of
his own head ; to what end I pray you should <font> Barker <$$font> do
it , but to advance the Marriage of the Duke his Master , and the <font>
Scotish <$$font> Queen ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.994

And was this without the Duke's privity ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.995

Could <font> Barker <$$font> compel the Duke to take a Wife at his
pleasure ? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.996

Examine now all these Witnesses , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.997

and weigh their Credits together ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.998

consider them severally , their Credits are great ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.999

join them all together , they be much greater ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1000

but severally examin'd , and all according to one , they be greatest of
all , and not possible to be false . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1001

Add to that the Duke's own Confessions of Circumstances concerning
himself , and their uttering of matters of Treason against themselves ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1002

consider the difference of dangers in telling truly or falsely :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1003

for if they utter'd it , and it were true , then stood they but in
danger of their bodily Life ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1004

if they should falsely accuse , yet that Accusation suffering against
themselves for Treasons , they lost both Body and Soul , in falsely
accusing others . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1005

The Duke was their Master , they his Servants , and his true Servants ,
and such as were to gain by his Prosperity ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1006

would they untruly accuse him , the stay of their Preferment ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1007

For tho' they be Traitors , and howsoever they be otherwise without
Credit , yet against the Duke of <font> Norfolk <$$font> they are well
to be believ'd . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1008

Now on the other side against the Duke's own Credit , which he hath by
his own doings impaired and made inferior to these of lower degree : You
have heard of his Oath especially taken for the Commission at <font>
York <$$font> , to deal truly and sincerely ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1009

he kept it not , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1010

he so dealt as if an Oath were of no great weight with him .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1011

His Oath of a Counsellor he hath broken , both in disclosing of Secrets
, and in giving advice to a foreign Prince , and a Competitor of the
Queen's Crown , against the Queen's Majesty his Sovereign Lady .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1012

Now may it not be that these Men of mean degree and value , against whom
it is not alledg'd that they have been at any time perjured , may be
produced and credited against him that hath so little esteem'd his Oath
? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1013

I have heard also , that there was an Oath wilfully taken upon a Bible ,
in denying of things laid to his charge , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1014

and yet the matter was found true , and by himself within a short space
confessed : so that his Oath , his Hand , and his Word , bear no sway
with him . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1015

He submitted himself , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1016

he subscribed his Submission , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1017

and seal'd it ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1018

he added solemn Promises upon his Faith and Allegiance , not to proceed
in the Marriage between the <font> Scotish <$$font> Queen and himself :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1019

but he kept not touch , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1020

he broke Promise also , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1021

and yet he saith his Hand , Mouth and Heart go together .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1022

If they go together in the right way , it is well ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1023

but when they go together in Untruth , it is evil and dangerous :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1024

therefore it is not for my Lord of <font> Norfolk <$$font> to stand so
much upon the discrediting of the Witnesses , and advancing of his own
Credit , which himself hath so much decayed .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1025

Now I will go to the Proof . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1026

<font> Duke . <$$font> I shall hardly come , after so smooth a Tale as
Mr. Attorney of the Wards can tell ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1027

yet one good Proof I have to my Comfort , that they be as please your
Lordships to weigh them . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1028

If you would not have dealt thus untruly with me , I would not have
taken exception against them , tho' I chiefly challenge none but <font>
Barker <$$font> , in whom you may see what Fear may do ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1029

besides that they have confessed themselves Traitors , and so Men of no
Conscience or Credit . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1030

It is well known that <font> Barker <$$font> 's Stomach is nothing ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1031

he hath been known well enough . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1032

Fear hath done much in him . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1033

The Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> is also a fearful Man .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1034

As touching <font> Barker <$$font> and the Bishop of <font> Rosse ,
Bracton <$$font> hath a Saying , That Witnesses must be Freemen and not
Traitors , neither outlawed nor attainted .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1035

<font> Catlin . <$$font> None of them be outlaw'd , attainted , or
indicted . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1036

<font> Duke . <$$font> I mean not that they were indicted ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1037

but they be in as ill Case , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1038

for they have confessed themselves Traitors .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1039

He saith also , they must be <font> Legales <$$font> , lawful Men ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1040

and so can@ @not Strangers be , as the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font>
and <font> Rodolph <$$font> ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1041

it is these Strangers that charge me only , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1042

the other having dealt so disloyally , and confessed it against
themselves , are not to be believ'd . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1043

As for <font> Barker <$$font> , I have not used him as my Secretary
these thirteen years : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1044

he entered with the Bishop of <font> Rosse <$$font> ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1045

and dealt with him in these Matters against my Knowledge .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1046

<font> Catlin . Bracton <$$font> indeed is an old Writer of our Law ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1047

and by <font> Bracton <$$font> he may be a Witness ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1048

a Stranger , a Bondman may be a Witness : THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1049

Ask you all the Judges here . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1050

And the Judges affirmed that he may . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1051

<font> Duke . <$$font> If a Stranger be to give Evidence whereby Lands
should be recovered , you shall not recover upon that Evidence given by
a Stranger . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1052

<font> Wilbraham . <$$font> This were a strange Device , that <font>
Scots <$$font> might not be Witnesses ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1053

for so , if a Man would commit Treason , and make non privy but <font>
Scots <$$font> , the Treason were unpunishable ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1054

and so were a kind of Men found out , with whom a Man might freely
conspire Treason . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1055

<font> Duke . <$$font> You say my Indictment is only upon the Statute
of 25 <font> Edward <$$font> III . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1056

That Statute standeth upon three points , compassing the Death of the
Prince's Person , levying of War against the Prince , and aiding of the
Prince's Enemies ; THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1057

and all these must be prov'd Overt-@ @fact .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1058

If by any way , by any Overt-@ @fact , you can prove that I have
directly touch'd the Prince's Person , or done any of the said things
that the Statute extendeth to , I will yield myself guilty .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1059

If any thing be doubtful , the Statute referreth it to the Judgment of
the Parliament . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1060

<font> Catlin . <$$font> Usage is the best Expounder of the Law , that
is , the common Use how the Statute hath been taken and expounded ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1061

and the same Statute is but the Declaration of the common Law .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1062

<font> Duke . <$$font> The Preamble of the Statute is to bring the Laws
of Treason to a certainty , that Men may certainly know what is Treason
. THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1063

<font> Attorney-Gen. <$$font> You complained of your close keeping ,
that you had no Books to provide for your Answer ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1064

it seemeth you have had Books and Counsel , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1065

you alledge Books , Statutes , and <font> Bracton <$$font> ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1066

I am sure the study of such Books is not your Profession .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1067

<font> Duke . <$$font> I have been in Trouble these two Years ,
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1068

think you that in all this time I have not had cause to look for myself
? THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1069

<font> Attorney-Gen. <$$font> But if you stand still upon proof ,
whether you have done any thing to the Destruction of the Prince's
Person , if the Lords upon the Evidence already produced , do think the
Matters true in Fact that are already alledged against you , surely the
same must needs be construed a compassing of the Queen's Death ;
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,113.1070

for the Law of Treason hath ever been <P_114> largely construed for the
Prince's Safety . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,114.1071

Think you that practising to levy War within the Realm is not Treason ?
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,114.1072

Yes indeed is it ; and a compassing of the Prince's Death .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,114.1073

Sir <font> William Stanley <$$font> 's Case was this :
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,114.1074

He did but send <font> Clifford <$$font> over Sea , to hearken and send
him word what <font> Perkin Warbeck <$$font> was ; that if he thought
<font> Perkin <$$font> was such a Man as he was said to be , he would
take his part . THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,114.1075

This was <font> Stanley <$$font> 's Case , THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,114.1076

and this was judged Treason , and a compassing of the King's Death .
THOWARD2-1571-E2-P2,114.1077
