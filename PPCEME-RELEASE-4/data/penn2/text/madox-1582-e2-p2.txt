and on Fryday M. Hood took a dolphin which was indeed a fyne whyt meat

Being as we suppozed within 5 degrees of the lyne or lesse we descryed a
hygh land abowt 9 leags of at east northeast which we deemed to be Capo
de Palmas or Capo de Verga so that Luk Ward with his master and pilat
seeing us cast offward cam aboord and wyshed that in_as_much as we did
ly bwelting at the sea and cold doe noe good wee shold stand in with
some harboroe for the releif of our cumpanyes .

Than was the cowncel cawled to <P_153> se wher we wer
MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.302

and now every mans reconyng was behind the ships way above 50 leags
wherby I did perceav that ether they had not geven yt alowance to
leeward as the ships lyst required or els ther ran some current which
set us to the eastward under the wether bow MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.303

and so I think yt trew MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.304

for at nyght we wer in a very rugh race {GLOSS:current} at 65 fadom of
soft sandy oze lyke bran and brayd {GLOSS:beaten} pepper , which I
judged to be St. Annes Shole . MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.305

Wel when the viceadmiral was come aboord with his master and Blackoller
, our general , which had cast to the offard west northwest , at the

good for some of us wer dead and many syck cauled the matter in cowncel

and proposed the question wher we wer , shewing his own accownt and
others . MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.307

M. Whood sayd the land we saw was Capo de Palmas or els hee wold fyrst
be hanged and after cut in 1000 peeces . MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.308

Such an insolent spech men wold not for modesty sack crose , althogh
ther wer reasons to the contrary . MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.309

Than was demanded whether were {TEXT:missing_"were"} better go forward
to the east or go back agayn to the norwest . MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.310

M. Haukins with good probable reasons shewd that the further we passed
eastward the further wer we fro the river of Plate
MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.311

and better therfore to passe to the Surliona MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.312

for yf we wer ether caulmed or fownd the wynd in any part of the sowth
we myght harbor ther with great safety , MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.313

but yf northerly we myght put of to our great advauntedge .

for when Sir Frances Drake did ther water they set one the potage pot
with ryce every meale . MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.316

The general was loth to go thither pretending that he feared the health
of his men because al had spoke yl of the cuntrey ,
MADOX-1582-E2-P2,153.317

but the very truth was , he feared lest fynding ther suffyciency for our
provision he shold have than no pretence to passe to the westward
notwithstanding M. Hawkins objecting that the {TEXT:missing_"the"}
further we went eastward the further we wer from our mark and in more
danger to be <P_154> calmed , MADOX-1582-E2-P2,154.318

he yelded to go back to Sera Leona except the wynd served .
MADOX-1582-E2-P2,154.319

Capten Ward as I perceived undertaking this viage as wel for the hope of
his experience as of his profyt and rather more was desyrows to se the
shore MADOX-1582-E2-P2,154.320

and on this agreement we departed MADOX-1582-E2-P2,154.321

but presently after the wynd comyng agayn to the sowthwest which was

having seen sune or stars for 14 days , MADOX-1582-E2-P2,154.327

but of truth we were not so far to the sowthward by 3 degrees at the
least toward the sowth MADOX-1582-E2-P2,154.328

and therfor whether the current set to the nornorest by the reset and
yeynwal of Brazil or whether the streames of Rio Grande or other rivers
that fawl myghtyly into the sea cause some current or whether yt always
do foloe the wynd , sure I am we wer no nyer than 8 degrees to the lyne
MADOX-1582-E2-P2,154.329

and I think further of MADOX-1582-E2-P2,154.330
