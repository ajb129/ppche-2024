The Dutch fleet , we heard yesterday , were at y=e= North Forland .

We doe our utmost endeavor to get to them , if they have a mind to fight
us . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,11.33

To y=e= westwards of y=e= Downes they may easely be w=th= us ;
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,11.34

but we judge there designe is to ingage us amongst the sands , w=ch=
posibly they may be deceaved in there expectation .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,11.35

God Almighty goe along w=th= us RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,11.36

RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,11.41

My deare Betty , The 18th instant , w=ch= was Satuarday last , I wrote
the by one of the yachts , and as thou advised .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,12.76

Y=e= next day we saw the Dutch fleet . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,12.77

We drew ours into a lyne of bataile , the French leading , we in the
reare , all prepared to fight , haveing stav'd and heft over bord all
ours , and I think all the cabins of the whole fleet .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,12.78

The Hollanders stood over for y=e= Flaunders Banks and y=e= Weelings .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,12.79

About 7 at night we were up w=th= them in a lyne , as they lay in the
same posture very orderly to rec=e= us ; RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,12.80

but , finding it would have bine darke before we could have well began
with them , being about 4 or 5 miles to leewards of us , y=e= wind at
W.S.W. , we thought it not convenient to ingage them .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,12.81

Y=e= night following , upon there tacking of , we tackt in y=e= reare ,
y=e= whole fleet following to keep them to <P_13> leewards of us , as we
did y=t= night by our twice tacking againe . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.82

Yesterday morning it proved a very thick fogge .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.83

We w=th= our division anchored , standing in w=th= the Banks of
Flaunders of Oostend . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.84

About 10 in y=e= morning , upon cleareing up , we wayed anchor , y=e=
Dutch fleet 3 miles to leewards of us . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.85

We stood of RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.86

and mett our fleet standing in . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.87

Y=e= Dutch stood of w=th= us . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.88

This day it proved much wind , that we could not fight them ; whereupon
we stood in to our shore N.W. , RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.89

and about 1$$2 seas over we anchored all night .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.90

This morneing we saw y=e= fleet again . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.91

We stood of towards them , expecting they would have stood w=th= us ;
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.92

but they stood of intending to draw us over amongst those shoulds , to
fight them there . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.93

We keeping our wind , and they bearing away , as we suposed , from y=e=
wind , we lost sight of them . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.94

It blowing hard we tackt , RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.95

and now come neare to Sowle Bay , where I supose we may stay a day or
two to watter our fleet . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.96

This day came into us the Katherine , Princes , and Advice , w=th= 2
fire ships more ; soe y=t= I supose we are neerer 90 then fowerscore men
of warr , upwards 25 fireships , amongst w=ch= my unckle R.H. is come .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.97

The Dutch fleet not soe many men of warr as we , I beleive , by 8 or 10
saile , many small vessels and fire ships . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.98

Had it pleased God yesterday to have given us faire weather , God
assisting , we had given a good acc=t= of o=r= actions ; our men briske
and brave and very ready and willing to fight .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,13.99

Am glad we gote hither , RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,14.114

for stormy weather may shatter us and disable us more then a bataile .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,14.115

God Almighty be our guard and defence , RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,14.116

On bord the R. Charles , RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.128

this 29th May , 1673 ; RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.129

7 leagues of Oostend . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.130

My dearest Love , These are to give the an acc=t= of God's goodnes to me
. RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.131

I am very well and in health , praised be His name therfore .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.132

Yesterday , the 28th instant <paren> y=e= same day twelve month they
atacqued us in Sowle bay <$$paren> , we atacqued the Dutch fleet ,
consisting of 74 or 76 men of warr and 20 fire ships , as the Dutch
prisoners informe us . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.133

We set upon them in the Schoon Velt , the wind at W.N.W=t=. ,
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.134

but changed to y=e= N.N.E. in the bataile towards evening .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.135

We buoyed the outward banks w=th= our smacks and ketches ,
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.136

and had a smart brush with them from 12 at noone as long as day light
lasted . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.137

The damage we have done them we certainly know not .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.138

Severall of ther ships we disabled , w=ch= we forced into leewards :
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.139

Trump , whose squadron we ingaged w=th= ours , shifted his ship once ,
if not twice . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.140

What number of men we have lost in the fleet not yet known {SIC:know} ;
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.141

I believe not 500 . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.142

In our ship not above 20 , as I can learne ; RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.143

some mortally {SIC:mortality} wounded , others dismembred .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.144

Amongst our dead men is poore Capt. Wasey , who first lost his arme
close to his shoulders and about 6 howers after dyed of his wounds .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.145

My brother Joseph very well ; RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.146

was w=th= me last night after y=e= bataile . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.147

My unckle Richard very well : RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.148

he hath burnt his ship ; RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,19.149

was faire to burne De Rutter within his length , when they shote his
masts about his eares ; for w=ch= indeavoured service y=e= Prince hath
given him one_hundred pounds , and gratified <P_20> also his oficers ,
&c. RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.150

I supose we shall not atacque them in that place againe .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.151

Our greatest care was to keepe cleere of the sands in that narrow hole .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.152

Our ship , so tender with a saile that we fought w=th= the watter some
tymes comeing into our lower tire of ports , w=ch= was very
disadvantagious , could not do that service intended by us .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.153

There is severall Cap=ts= killed that we have already an account of ;
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.154

I hope no more . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.155

Capt. Finch in the Yorke , Capt. Tempest in the Sweepestakes , Capt.
Fowles in the Lyon ; and Capt. Werden , in the Heneretta , mortally
{SIC:mortality} wounded . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.156

We have severall of our ships shattered , not above two disabled , and
none , as I heare of , lost , but 2 or 2 {COM:sic} fire ships burnt .
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.157

We ride now w=th=in 3 leagues of the Dutch fleete ;
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.158

they ride in the place we atacqued them in , and we in our former birth
, only about 2 leagues further of the shore . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.159

How soone we shall fight them againe can@ @not resolve ,
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.160

but in y=e= place they now ride I iudge we shall not atacque them a
second tyme . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.161

I beleive the Prince may shift his ship and goe into some other ;
RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.162

but of y=t= in my next . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.163

I desire that thanks and prayes may be returned to Almighty God for his
preservation of me . RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.164

My humble duty to my deare mother ; RHADDSR-1673-E3-P2,20.165
