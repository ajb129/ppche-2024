Fifteen_hundred Pound a year , and a great Bag of Money ;
VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.240

the Match is concluded , VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.241

the Writings are drawn , VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.242

and the Pipkin@ @'s to be crack'd in a Fortnight -
VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.243

Now you must know , Stripling <paren> with Respect to your Mother
<$$paren> your Brother@ @'s the Son of a Whore .

and has promis'd me as much more in ready Money upon the Day of Marriage
, which I understand by a Friend , he ne'er designs to pay me ;
VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.247

if therefore you will be a generous young Dog , and secure me
Five_thousand Pounds , I@ @'ll be a covetous old Rogue , and help you to
the Lady . VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.248

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> I'gad , if thou can'st bring this about , I@

This plump Partridge , that I tell you of , lives in the Country , Fifty
Miles off , with her Honoured Parents , in a lonely old House which
nobody comes near ; VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.252

she never goes abroad , VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.253

nor sees Company at home : VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.254

To prevent all Misfortunes , she has her breeding within doors ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.255

the Parson of the Parish teaches her to play on the Base-Viol , the
Clerk to sing , her Nurse to dress , and her Father to dance :
VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.256

In short , no body can give you admittance there but I ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.257

nor can I do it any other way , than by making you pass for your Brother
. VANBR-1696-E3-P2,30.258

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> And how the Devil wilt thou do that ?

desperately in Love , as soon as you see her ; make that your Plea for
Marrying her immediately , VANBR-1696-E3-P2,31.265

and when the Fatigue of the Wedding-Night@ @'s over , you shall send me

<font> Miss . <$$font> Psha , if you had , you@ @'d ne'er a thought
much on@ @'t . VANBR-1696-E3-P2,78.778

<font> Nurse . <$$font> O but 't@ @is a Sin - Sweeting .
VANBR-1696-E3-P2,78.779

<font> Bull . <$$font> Nay , that@ @'s my business to speak to , Nurse
; VANBR-1696-E3-P2,78.780

I do confess , to take two Husbands for the satisfaction of the Flesh ,
is to commit the Sin of Exorbitancy ; VANBR-1696-E3-P2,78.781

but to do it for the Peace of the Spirit , is no more than {it_is} be
drunk by way of Physick ; VANBR-1696-E3-P2,78.782

besides , to prevent a Parent's Wrath , is to <P_79> avoid the Sin of
Disobedience ; VANBR-1696-E3-P2,79.783

for when the Parent@ @'s angry , the Child is froward . So that upon
the whole Matter , I do think , tho' Miss shou'd Marry again , she may
be sav'd . VANBR-1696-E3-P2,79.784

<font> Miss . <$$font> I Cod , and I will marry again then ,
VANBR-1696-E3-P2,79.785

and so there is an end of the Story . VANBR-1696-E3-P2,79.786
