and lay in a room together ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,162.9

fastend , ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,162.15

but , forcing it open , found them weltring in thier blood and craling
to ask one another pardon . ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,162.16

T@ @is sayed there was little hopes that either could recover .
ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,162.17

Some letters say the eldest was already dead , tho <P_2,163> wone can@
@not say this is certain ; ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,163.18

there are so manny letters that speake of it y=t= there relations are
fearfull it is too true . ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,163.19

Y=e= 31 of De. , 1694 {COM:preceding_word_"1694"_emended} .
ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,209.26

My Lord , The sad confirmation last nights letters brought me of the
death of my most deare mistress , the Queen , gives me so just an
affliction that I am but little thoughtfull of my neerest concerns .
ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,209.27

The want of coach horses has , since my Lords going , hinderd me from
waitting of y=r= Losp. , and the news this last week of her illness
from sending to know how you did . ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,209.28

God has been pleased to shorten her days as a reward of her sufferings ,
w=ch= in this world were not slight , w=ch= , w=th= the goodness of her
owne nature , had formed in her so great a degree of vertu , it might
truely be sayd the world was not worthy of her .
ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,209.29

A poore lamentation is all the gratitude that can be payd her now for
that favor so undeservedly she bestowed on me ,
ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,209.30

is all that now can be returned by , my Lord , Y=r= most obedient ,
duttyfull daughter , A. Nottingham . ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,209.31

Twelfth Day , 1695 {COM:preceding_word_"1695"_emended} .
ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,209.33

My Lord , My Lord Nottingham has so great a share in this loss himself ,
that his owne affliction makes him apprehend mine .
ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,209.34

I must be <P_2,210> excesively ungratefull to that incompareable
Princess , to be unconcerned that she is gone ; and yet more ungratefull
to God , to be insensible of those many blessings he still continues to
me . ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,210.35

I can@ @not express myself better upon this sad occasion then as the
Dean of Pauls has already done : ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,210.36

We must be dumb and not open our mouths , because God did it .
ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,210.37

I have obeyed y=r= Losp. commands to the two Lady Marys , who give you
their humble service and hope I shall return from London so soon , they
may w=th= me waitt of you . ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,210.38

I should have been very glad to have waitted of you as I went up ,
ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,210.39

but my coachman tells t@ @is much the worse way ,
ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,210.40

and , I confess , upon this occasion I am desirous to have as few delays
as I can in that performance of my poore remaining dutty to my deare
mistress . ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,210.41

Essex I thinke to take w=th= me , ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,210.42

and the others have not yet got there mourning .
ANHATTON-1693-E3-P2,2,210.43

At my return I hope they may waitt of you , w=th= y=r= Losp. most
obedient , duttyfull daughter , A. Nottingham .
