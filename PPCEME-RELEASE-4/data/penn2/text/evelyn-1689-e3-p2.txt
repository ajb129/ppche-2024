EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,925.73

I went after all publique devotions were finish'd to visite the Bishop
of St. Asaph <paren> the Queens Almoner who was now entered upon the
sole Regal Government during her husbands Absence <$$paren> where was
the Bishops of Lond. & Worcester & Deane of Paules Dr Tenison &c: all
of them not a little surpriz'd at what had happned in <font> Savoy
<$$font> , among the <font> Voudois <$$font> , who being so neere their
destruction & final extirpation by the French , as that they were
generaly given up as to slaughter , & that every body expected to heare
of their calamities & final destruction : It pleased God that
{COM:preceding_word_"that"_emended} the Duke of <P_926> Savoy <paren>
hitherto joyning with the French in persecution of those poore
Christians , & now pressed by the French to deliver Verrue
{COM:preceding_word_"Verrue"_emended} & Turin as Cautionary to the
French , upon their suspicion that he might at last come into the German
Princes Confederacy <$$paren> having seacretly concerted with the
Confederats , & adjusted the Condition &c , not onely declared for the
Confederats , but invited those poore Christians from their <font>
dispersions & Latebrae <$$font> among the Mountain whither they had fled
; but restor'd them to their Country , Dwellings , Exercise of the
Religion , beged pardon for the ill usage they had received , & charging
it upon the cruelty of the French , who forced him to it &c: These being
the Remainder of those persecuted Christians , whom
{COM:preceding_word_"whom"_emended} the Bishop had so long time ,
affirmed to be the 2 Wittnesses spoken of in the Revelation who should
be Kild , & brought to life againe ; EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,926.74

It was looked on as an extraordinary thing ; That this Prophetique Bish:
should perswade two fugitive Ministers of the <font> Vodois <$$font> to
returne to their Country , & furnish them with 20 pounds towards their
journey , at that very time , when it was believed nothing but universal
destruction was to be expected , assuring them , & shewing them from the
Text in the Apocalypse that their Country men should be returned safely
to their Country , before they arived , let them make what hast they
could : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,926.75

This so hapning contrary to all expectation & appearance , did
exceedingly credit the Bishops Confidence how that prophesy of the
Witnesses , should so come to passe , so just at the time & very moneth
of which he had spoken some yeares before : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,926.76

I went afterwards with him to visite Mr. Boyle & Lady Ranelagh his
sister , to whom he explaind the necessity of its so falling out by the
Scriptures in a very wonderfull manner , which he most skillfully &
learnedly made out ; with what events were immediately to follow of the
French Kings ruine , The Turkes , & Calling of the Jewes to be neere at
hand ; but that the total Kingdom of Antichrist , would yet not be
utterly destroyed til 30 years , when Christ should
{COM:preceding_word_"should"_emended} begin the Milennium , not as
himselfe personally {COM:preceding_word_"personally"_emended} reigning
in Earth Visibly ; but that the true Religion & universal peace , should
obtaine thro all the world : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,926.77

he shewed how Mr. Brightman , Mr. Meade , and other Interpreters of
their Events , failed , by mistaking & reckoning the yeares as the
Latines & others did , to consist of the present Calculation & so many
<P_927> dayes to the yeare ; wheras , the Apocalyps , reckons after the
Persian account , as Daniel did whose Visions St. John all along
explains , as meaning onely the Christian Church : &c.
EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,927.78

My Lady Sunderland acquainted me at large of {TEXT:missing_"of"} his
Majestie taking away the Seales from her husband , & of her being with
the Queene to interceede for him : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,891.335

It is conceiv'd he grew remisse of late in pursuing the Interest of the
Jesuitical Counsels , EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,891.336

some reported one thing , some another ; EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,891.337

but there was doubtlesse some seacret betraied , which time may discover
: EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,891.338

There was a Council now cald , to which were summon'd the A:Bish of
Cant. &c {COM:preceding_word_"&c"_emended} : Judges , Lord Major &c:

birth , which was recorded , both at the Council board , & at the
Chancery a day or two after : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,891.340

This procedure was censur'd by some , as below his Majestie to
condescend to , upon the talke of Idle people :
EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,891.341

Remarkable on this occasion , was the refusal of the A_Bish Marq:
Halifax , Earles of Clarendon & Notinghams refusing to sit at the
Council Table in their places , amongst Papists , & their bold telling
his Majestie that what ever was don whilst such sate amongst them was
unlawfull , & incurr'd praemunire : if at least , it be true , what I
heard : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,891.342

I din'd with my Lord Preston , now made Seccretary of state in place of

assurance . EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,892.360

A Man was taken with divers papers & printed Manifests , & carried to
Newgate after examination at the Cabinet-Council :
EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,892.361

There was likewise a declaration of the States , for satisfaction of all
publique Ministers in their Dominions , the reason of their furnishing
the Prince with their Vessels & Militia on this Expedition , which was
delivered to all the Ambassadors & publique Ministers at the Hague
except to the English & French : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,892.362

There was in that of the Princes , an expression as if the Lords both
Spiritual & Temporal &c had invited him over , with a deduction of the
Causes of his enterprise : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,892.363

This made his Majestie Convene my L: of <font> Cant: <$$font> & the
other Bishops now in Towne , to give {COM:preceding_word_"give"_emended}
them an account of what was in the <font> Manifesto <$$font> : & to

heard the newes of the Prince of Orange@ @s , being landed at Tor-bay ,
with a fleete of neere 700 saile , so dreadfull a <P_893> sight passing
through the Channell with so favorable a Wind , as our Navy could by no
meanes intercept or molest them : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,893.380

This put the King & Court into greate Consternation ,
EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,893.381

now employed in forming an Army to incounter their farther progresse :
EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,893.382

for they were gotten already into Excester , & the season , & wayes very
improper for his Majesties forces to march so greate a distance :
EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,893.383

The A_Bish of Cant , & some few of the other Bishops , & Lords in Lond.
were sent for to White-hall , & required to set forth their abhorrency
of this Invasion ; EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,893.384

They assured his Majestie they had never invited any of the Princes
party or were in the least privy to this Invasion , & would be ready to
shew all testimonies of their Loyalty &c: EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,893.385

but as to a publique declaration , they being so few , desired that his
majestie would call the rest of their brethren & peeres , that they
might consult what was fit to do on this occasion , not thinking it
convenient to publish any thing without them , & untill they had
themselves seene the Princes Manifest , in which it was pretended he was
invited in by the Lords Sp. & temporal : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,893.386

This did not please his Majestie : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,893.387

So they departed : EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,893.388

There came now out a Declaration , prohibiting all people to see or
reade the Princes Manifest ; in which was at large set forth
{SIC:set-forth} the cause of his Expedition , as there had ben once
{COM:preceding_word_"once"_emended} before one from the States :
EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,893.389

These are the beginnings of Sorrows , unlesse God in his Mercy prevent
it , by some happy reconciliation of all dissentions amongst us , which
nothing in likelihood can Effect but a free Parliament , but which we
can@ @not hope to see , whilst there are any forces on either side :
EVELYN-1689-E3-P2,893.390
