<P_201>

<font> Attorney Gen. <$$font> Yea , my Lord , you had three_hundred Men
in Arms in your House ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.3

why did you not dissolve them , being commanded upon your Allegiance
from the Queen to do it ? ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.4

<font> Essex . <$$font> They hearing rumours of Men about my House
against them put them into such a Fear and Extasy , that it was not in
my power suddenly to dissolve them , or to quench their Passions ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.5

and the rather , for that Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> desired Sir
<font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> to leave their Company , or else they
would all be lost ; so that they stood amazed , and knew not what to do
. ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.6

<font> Southampton . <$$font> Mr. Attorney , you speak all this as if
it were as true as Gospel . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.7

<font> Essex . <$$font> Good my Lord , let me intreat you to mark the
Circumstances : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.8

Word was brought that Men were sent for into the Country , to take us in
our own Houses ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.9

then we conceiving the thirsty Appetite of our private guard Enemies ,
took our selves to our Arms , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.10

and were glad to stand upon our guard for our own Defence .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.11

But as for the Lords of the Council that came to my House , we being
before advertised that we should be beset , thought it the securest way
for those of the Council to keep them there , not knowing what Mischief
would ensue . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.12

<font> Attorney Gen. <$$font> My Lord , your Grace sees that this is
without Colour or Question ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.13

for my Lord Chief Justice had proved it plain , that they would not
dissolve their Company that was up in Arms , being charged upon their
Allegiance so to do . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.14

<font> Essex . <$$font> Good my Lord , know whether it were in my Lord
of <font> Southampton <$$font> 's power or in mine to withhold their
Purposes so suddenly : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.15

For , not long before Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> had sent to my
House to have Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> come to him to
<font> Durham-House <$$font> ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.16

and we fearing him to be a private Enemy , would not suffer Sir <font>
Ferdinando <$$font> to go thither , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.17

but returned answer , that he would meet him on the Water upon equal
Terms : where Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> used the former
Speeches to Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> , wishing him to leave
our Company , or else he would be undone . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.18

And whereas we are charged to have dealt with Papists , I assure your
Lordship , and it is most true , that Papists have been hired and
suborned to witness against me ; as by the means of one <font> Sudall
<$$font> , who was a Seminary Priest , and sent into <font> Ireland
<$$font> to deal with Sir <font> Christopher Blunt <$$font> , whom he
thought to be inward with me , to touch my Honour and Reputation .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.19

Then <font> Bales <$$font> , the Scrivener in the <font> Old Baily
<$$font> , hath confessed under his hand to forge and counterfeit my
Hand in at least two Letters ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.20

and these two honest Gentlemen can witness it .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.21

<font> Attorney Gen. <$$font> Ay , by my troth this is true ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.22

but it was by the Procurement of one of your own Men .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.23

<font> Essex . <$$font> Thou swearest it , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.24

but it is not on a Book ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.25

that Man thou sayest I procured to do it , his name is <font> John
Daniel <$$font> , an arrant Thief , one that broke a Standard of mine ,
and stole a Casket of my Wife's , and many other things .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.26

It is very probable that I should trust him so far , that had before
betrayed me , is it not ? ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.27

But it is well known who set him at work to attempt against me so much
as he hath done , to procure my hand to be counterfeited ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.28

and yet this Man , by your Judgment , must be a Practiser in such
Matters by my own Consent . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.29

Well , Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> , I thank God you are not my Judge
this Day , you are so uncharitable . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.30

<font> Attorney Gen. <$$font> Well , my Lord , we shall prove you anon
what you are , which your Pride of Heart , and aspiring Mind , hath
brought you unto . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.31

<font> Essex . <$$font> Ah ! Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> , lay your
Hand upon your Heart , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.32

and pray to God to forgive us both . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.33

<font> Raleigh . <$$font> That Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font>
told me upon the Water , that my Lord of <font> Essex . <$$font> had
put himself into a strong Guard at <font> Essex-House <$$font> , and
this is like to be the bloodiest day's work that ever was , wishing him
to go to Court with speed for prevention thereof :
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.34

Then Sir <font> Walter <$$font> wished Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges
<$$font> to refuse their Company , else he would be undone .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.35

To this Sir <font> Walter <$$font> was sworn .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.36

<font> Essex . <$$font> Whatsoever Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>
hath said , differeth altogether from that which Sir <font> Ferdinando
Gorges <$$font> told us at <font> Essex-House <$$font> , upon his return
from the Water . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.37

<font> Attorn. Gen. <$$font> Well , my Lord , what can you devise to
say for Sir <font> John Davis <$$font> , another of your Adherents ,
that Papist ? ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.38

for he hath confessed that he is a Papist and a Catholick , and drawn in
by Sir <font> Christopher Blount <$$font> , one of your chiefest Counsel
, and that he called for a Seminary Priest upon his Convertment to
absolve him . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,201.39

<font> Essex . <$$font> If Sir <font> John Davis <$$font> were such a
Man , it can@ @not be but strange to <P_202> me to hear it ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.40

altho' I can@ @not search into the Secrets of his Heart to accuse him
inwardly , yet I have seen him dutifully come to Prayers , and to the
Service of God in my own House with me , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.41

and behaved himself very godlily ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.42

and of this I can be witness . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.43

And as for <font> Blunt <$$font> <paren> God is my Witness <$$paren> I
have been so far from Popery , as I have so earnestly dealt with him to
reform himself , insomuch that he hath told me , I have been very
passionate . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.44

But whereas you say , we have committed Treason , first prove that true
. ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.45

<font> Serjeant Yelvert. <$$font> Why , my Lord , if you deny the
raising the Power , why should so many Men come to your House that day ?
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.46

<font> Southampton . <$$font> By your favour , Mr. Serjeant <font>
Yelverton <$$font> , a word , I hope ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.47

for my coming thither , it was not strange news ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.48

and when I came that same morning to <font> Essex-House <$$font> , I
protest I had not above ten or twelve men attending me , which was but
my usual Company , therefore far from purposing to raise a Tumult .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.49

<font> Attorn. Gen. <$$font> Why , the reason of that was , for that
you thought all <font> London <$$font> would have risen with you ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.50

but , good my Lord , I beseech your Grace to hear the Oath of Sir <font>
Ferdinando Gorges : <$$font> whose Evidence was read ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.51

and himself there in person did justify the same .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.52

<heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> Ferdinando Gorges <font> his Confession . <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.54

<$$heading>

He deposeth , That in <font> January <$$font> last the Earl of <font>
Essex <$$font> wrote to him a Letter , wherein he complained grievously
of his Misfortunes , and the miserable Estate he stood in , whereof he
purposed shortly to free himself , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.56

and therefore prayed Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> to come up to
<font> London <$$font> to him : who coming accordingly , the Earl told
him how mightily he was crossed and discredited by his private Enemies ,
which he could not endure ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.57

for , saith he , I have 120 Earls , Barons , and Gentlemen , that
participate in my discontented Humour , and will join with me ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.58

and I desire your Help and Counsel therein .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.59

One special Friend I have in the Court , whereby I have intelligence
from time to time : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.60

And I hold our selves indifferently affected by the Citizens of <font>
London <$$font> , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.61

and hope to have a good Party in <font> Wales <$$font> .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.62

He confessed also , that they had two several Meetings at <font>
Drury-House <$$font> , to consult of these Matters ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.63

and the Projects were , Whether it were better first to surprize the
Court , or to take the Tower of <font> London <$$font> , or to stir in
the City . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.64

But most agreed , first to surprize the Court .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.65

And then and there Sir <font> John Davis <$$font> took Pen , Ink , and
Paper , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.66

and set down , That some should keep the Hall , some the Court-Gates ,
some the Guard-Chamber , and some the Presence-Chamber ; saying , many
of the Guard had been the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> 's Servants ,
and were preferred to the Queen by him , and will be more indifferent to
deal with than others ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.67

and so my Lord shall have a way thro' his own Guards to come to the
Privy-Chamber , and the Presence of the Queen .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.68

And Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> said to the Earl of <font>
Essex <$$font> , Alas ! My Lord , what is so small a number of Men able
to do in so worthy an Action ? ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.69

and so dissuaded the Earl from surprizing the Court ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.70

and rather bade him submit himself to the Queen's Mercy , than proceed
any further . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.71

And that the Earl of <font> Southampton <$$font> said at <font>
Essex-House <$$font> , Is it not three months since this Plot began ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.72

and shall we resolve on nothing ? ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.73

Then upon a sudden they all agreed , first to stir in <font> London
<$$font> , where they assured themselves of great Favour :
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.74

And after the Council was lock'd up , this Deponent followed the Troops
into <font> London <$$font> ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.75

and after some advice the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> sent him back
again with a Token to deliver to the Lord Chief Justice only , by colour
of which Token he set at liberty the Lord Keeper and the rest .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.76

Lastly , he confirmed , that he told Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>
first , upon the <font> Thames <$$font> , of my Lord of <font> Essex
<$$font> 's making his House a Guard , and putting his Friends into Arms
, as it is delivered by Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.77

<font> Queen's Counsel . <$$font> We desire , that the Examination of
Sir <font> Charles Davers <$$font> may be read ; <font> which being
produced , was then read to this effect : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.78

<heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> Charles Davers's <font> Examination . <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.80

<$$heading>

He confesseth , That before <font> Christmas <$$font> last the Earl of
<font> Essex <$$font> entred into Consideration , how he might secure
himself to have access to the Queen's Presence without Resistance ; and
that the Resolution was agreeable to certain Articles written with the
Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> 's own Hand , and sent to the Earl of
<font> Southampton <$$font> to surpize the Court ; and that there were
divers Consultations about it , and the Points were these : First , to
take the <font> Tower <$$font> , for it would command <font> London
<$$font> , then to surprise the Court ; and after , the Court being
taken and possessed , to have assembled the rest of their Friends , and
to have presented themselves to the Queen : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.82

and that being done , and the Guards secured , Sir <font> Christopher
Blount <$$font> should keep the outward Gates of the Court , Sir <font>
John Davis <$$font> the Hall and Water-gate ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.83

Sir <font> Charles Davers <$$font> <paren> this Deponent <$$paren>
should keep the Presence and Guard-Chamber , and seize upon the Halberts
and Pensioners Battle-Axes . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.84

The Intent was to surprize the Captain of the Guard at the Court , or at
his own House , and some others ; and then to surprize the Tower of
<font> London : <$$font> And that the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font>
resolved <paren> these things being accomplished <$$paren> immediately
to have called a Parliament to reform Disorders and private Grievances .
That this Deponent utterly disliked of these Courses ; and after the
Alarm was given at Court , he persuaded the Earl rather to flee into
<font> Wales <$$font> , or other parts beyond the Seas for his Security
, and avoiding the imminent Danger he was fallen into , than to trust to
the City . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.85

And lastly , he protested , for his own part , what he had done in the
business , was merely for the Love he bore to the Earl of <font>
Southampton . <$$font> , and not for any Malice or private Discontent
otherwise . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.86

When this was read , Mr. <font> Attorney General <$$font> produced the
Examination of Sir <font> John Davis <$$font> , which contained in
effect as follows : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.87

<heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> John Davis's <font> Examination . <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,202.89

<$$heading>

He saith , That the Earl's Purpose was , to possess himself of the Court
, and to take the Tower of <font> London <$$font> ; and that they had
several <P_203> Meetings of Consultation , together with the Earl of
<font> Southampton <$$font> , Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges , Jo.
Littleton <$$font> , Sir <font> Christopher Blount <$$font> , Sir <font>
Charles Davers <$$font> , and this Deponent .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.91

And these Matters <paren> he confesseth <$$paren> the Earl of <font>
Essex <$$font> set down all with his own Hand , <font> viz. <$$font>
Sir <font> Christopher Blount <$$font> to keep the outward Gate of the
Court himself , this Deponent the Hall and Water-gate , and Sir <font>
Charles Davers <$$font> the Presence and Guard-Chamber ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.92

then my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> and his Forces would have come by
Land , and so have possessed the Presence of the Queen .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.93

The question was asked the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> <paren> as this
Deponent saith <$$paren> , How he would deal with Offenders , and such
as resisted him , after he should be possessed of these things ?
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.94

He resolved them by way of Answer , That he meant to admit them all to
an honourable Trial . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.95

Then was produced the Confession of Sir <font> Christopher Blount
<$$font> , which was as follows . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.96

<heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> Christopher Blunt's <font> Examination . <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.98

<$$heading>

He confesseth that the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> sent <font> Wiseman
<$$font> , about the 20th of <font> January <$$font> , to visit his Wife
with Letters of Compliment , and to require him to come up unto him to
<font> London <$$font> , to settle his Estate according as he had
written unto him before some few days . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.100

Being demanded to what End they went to the City , to join with such
strength as they hoped for there ; he confesseth , it was to secure the
Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> 's Life , against such Forces as should be
sent against him . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.101

And being asked , What , against the Queen's Forces ? he answered ,
That must have been judged afterwards . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.102

But being further asked , Whether he did advise to come unto the Court
over Night ? he saith , No ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.103

for Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> did assure , that the Alarum
was taken of it at the Court , and the Guards doubled .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.104

Being asked , Whether he thought any Prince could have endured to have
any Subject make the City his Mediator ? or , to gather force to speak
for him ? he saith , He is not read in stories of former times ; but he
doth not know , but that in former times Subjects have used Force for
their mediation . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.105

Being asked , What should have been done by any of the Persons that
should have been removed from the Queen ? he answer'd , That he never
found my Lord disposed to shed Blood ; but that any that should have
been found , should have had indifferent Trial .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.106

Being asked upon his Conscience , Whether the Earl of <font> Essex
<$$font> did not give him Comfort , that if he came to Authority , there
should be a Toleration for Religion ? he confesseth , he should have
been to blame to have denied it . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.107

<font> Counsel . <$$font> There is another Examination of Sir <font>
Christopher Blount <$$font> 's ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.108

I pray let that be read . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.109

John Davis <$$font> , Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges , Jo. Littleton
<$$font> , and this Deponent ; which were to the effect before
remembered . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.113

And further this Deponent remembereth , That the Earl of <font> Essex
<$$font> 's Purpose was <paren> after these things should be over-passed
and settled <$$paren> to alter the State of Government :
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.114

And further this Deponent confesseth himself to be reconciled to the
Pope : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.115

And moreover saith , that the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> said , He
looked not that any should be troubled for Religion , and Liberty of
Conscience ; that he received Letters from the Earl of <font> Essex
<$$font> the 20th of <font> January <$$font> , to come to <font> London
<$$font> , whereupon he came . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.116

and the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> cried , It is for the good of the
Queen , and of you all , my Masters . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.127

First , he went to the Mayor's House , and then to Sheriff <font>
Smith's <$$font> House ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.128

and being in <font> Grace-Church-Street <$$font> , and hearing of the

Let him bring Muskets and Pistols ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.130

ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.141

And he saith , that Sheriff <font> Smith <$$font> was as far in the
Matter as the best of them . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.142

<font> Mr. Attorney . <$$font> Here Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font>
urged , that there was a Combination ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.143

and one <font> Pashell <$$font> affirm'd the burning of a black Purse by
the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> , which my Lord confesseth ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.144

but saith , that there was nothing in it , but a Key of an Iron-Chest ,
which he took out , and burnt a Paper in the same Purse , which did not
contain above five or six Lines of secret Matter : and , for that he
would not have so much as their Names drawn into question , which were
altogether ignorant of these Occurrents , did throw the Purse and Paper
into the Fire . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.145

And also <font> Pashell <$$font> confesseth further , that when the Earl
of <font> Essex <$$font> came out of <font> London <$$font> to his House
, he told them , that he was beloved in the City .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.146

<heading>

<font> Lord <$$font> Monteagle's <font> Examination . <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.148

<$$heading>

He saith , He had no Foreknowledge of these Matters ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,203.150

but confesseth , <P_204> he followed the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font>
down <font> Fleet-street <$$font> , intending to go to the Mayor , and
so to his House in <font> Seething-Lane <$$font> .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.151

And this Deponent being with the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> in <font>
Grace-Church-Street <$$font> , confesseth he did hear the Earl <paren>
when the Lord <font> Burleigh <$$font> came with the Herald at Arms
<$$paren> command some of his Followers to bid the Herald stay ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.152

for he would not hear him abuse the Queen's Name .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.153

He saith also , he went back with the Earl to <font> Ludgate <$$font> ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.154

and they were repulsed . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.155

<font> Mr. Attorney <$$font> . Now , my Lord , I beseech your Grace ,
and you , my Lords , that be the Peers , let the due Consideration of
these several Examinations and Depositions enter into your Hearts ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.156

and do but note , they have all agreed and jumped together in each
particular point , notwithstanding they were all severally examined :
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.157

but I must needs think it the just Judgment of God , in his mere Mercy
towards our Sovereign , to have the Truth so marvellously reveal'd ;
coming from them of their own accords , without Rack or Torture to any
of them . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.158

<font> Essex . <$$font> Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> , I answer , then
, this for that point ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.159

The self-same Fear , and the self-same Examiner , may make these several
Examinations agree all in one , were they never so far distant ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.160

but , good my Lord , let me intreat your Lordship to consider who they
be that testify this against me : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.161

My Lord , they are Men within the Danger of the Law , and such as speak
with a desire to live ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.162

but I think they have much to answer for between God and their Souls and
me . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.163

I see they charge me with the surprizing of the <font> Tower <$$font> ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.164

but upon what ground do they speak ? ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.165

They had only some particular Notes of my Friends Names ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.166

but ever very scornfully dashed at me ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.167

for when my Friends persuaded me to any course , this was my purpose ,
to have come with eight or nine honourable Persons , who had just Cause
of Discontentment <paren> tho' not equal with mine <$$paren> unto her
Majesty , and so by Petition , prostrating our selves at her Majesty's
feet , to have put our selves unto her Mercy .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.168

And the Effect of our Desires should have been , that she would have
been pleased to have sever'd some from her Majesty , who , by reason of
their Potency with her , abused her Majesty's Ears with false
Informations ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.169

and they were <font> Cobham , Cecil <$$font> , and <font> Raleigh :
<$$font> ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.170

For we {COM:sic} thought my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> carried himself
in such factious and dangerous Courses , as he told her Majesty many
Untruths ; which was a principal Cause <paren> as I think <$$paren> of
withdrawing her Favour from us . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.171

And to that intent , to remove such from her Highness <paren> I confess
<$$paren> was the only desire we had to present our selves in all
Humility before her Majesty , but without any purpose of Hurt to her
Highness : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.172

for , I protest before God , I do carry as reverent and loyal Duty to
her Majesty , as any Man in the World . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.173

But now , my Lord , seeing that I have heard the Testimony of Sir <font>
Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> , and himself here in Court to testify it , I
will say no more , but that if it please her Majesty to be merciful unto
him , I will be glad , and pray for it ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.174

yet whatsoever he hath said , let my Life and his Dealing testify the
Truth : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.175

and , Sir <font> Ferdinando <$$font> , speak nothing to touch thy self ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.176

and speak what thou wilt to me ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.177

for I see thou desirest to live , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.178

yet speak like a Man . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.179

<font> Lord Admiral . <$$font> I desire , for the better Satisfaction
of my self and Fellow-Peers , that <font> Gorges <$$font> might unfold
openly what other Secrets have passed between him and my Lord of <font>
Essex <$$font> , touching the State . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.180

<font> Essex . <$$font> Ah ! my Lord Admiral , assure your self , in
faith , no Treason : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.181

But yet , I pray thee , good Sir <font> Ferdinando <$$font> , speak
openly whatsoever thou dost remember ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.182

and with all my heart I desire thee to speak freely .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.183

<font> Gorges . <$$font> All that I can remember , I have deliver'd in
my Examination ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.184

and further , I can@ @not say . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.185

<font> Essex . <$$font> Yes , <font> Ferdinando <$$font> , if ever you
knew any other Matter , which contained any Thought of Treason or
Disloyalty , speak it ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.186

for they are things not to be forgotten . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.187

<font> Southampton . <$$font> Good Sir <font> Ferdinando <$$font> ,
satisfy the Court what was intended among all our Conferences ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.188

and Talk of our Enemies , and Discontentments , and Consultations , and
what was our best Course for our Defence against them .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.189

<font> Gorges . <$$font> Some delivered their Minds one way , some
another ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.190

but , by the Oath I have taken , I did never know or hear any Thought or
Purpose of Hurt or Disloyalty intended to her Majesty's Person by my
Lord of <font> Essex . <$$font> ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.191

<font> Lord Admiral . <$$font> I desire to know , for the better
Satisfaction of my Conscience , whether my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font>
did at any time deliver out any Articles in writing under his hand ,
therein laying open the Projects of his Purpose for surprizing the Court
and <font> Tower <$$font> . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.192

<font> Southampton . <$$font> It was a foolish Action , I must needs
confess , the going thro' the Town , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.193

and that was suddenly passed over : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.194

But my Lord's purpose to have Men planted at the Court , was in regard
he feared hindrance by private Enemies , that would have stopped his
Passage to the Queen ; which , I protest , he intended to no other end ,
but to prostrate himself at her Majesty's feet , and submit to her Mercy
, as ye have formerly heard . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.195

<font> Cobham . <$$font> My Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> <paren> quoth
the Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> , standing up <$$paren> , let me know ,
I intreat you , why you lay such Imputations upon me , as you have
deliver'd . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.196

<font> Essex . <$$font> My Lord , I have forgiven all the World ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.197

and therefore you shall not need to insist upon these Circumstances ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.198

for I lay not my Cause upon aught that shall do your Lordship any harm
for my sake : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.199

For , I protest , my Heart bears you no Malice ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.200

but what I spake was freely , and in God's presence , hoping her Majesty
would have heard us , and our Complaints being true .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.201

And I do further assure your Lordship , that I never spake it out of
fear of Death , or desire of Life . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.202

<font> Bacon . <$$font> My Lord , may it please your Grace , whatsoever
my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> hath here denied , in my conceit it
seemeth to be small . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.203

I speak not to any ordinary Jury , but to prudent , grave and wise Peers
: ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.204

And this I must needs say , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.205

It is evident that you , my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> , had planted
a Pretence in your Hearts against the Government ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.206

and now , under colour of excuse , you must lay the Cause upon
particular Enemies . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.207

You put me in remembrance of one <font> Pisistratus <$$font> , that was
come into a City , and doting upon the Affections of the Citizens unto
him <paren> he having a purpose to procure the Subversion of a Kingdom ,
and wanting Aid for the accomplishing his Humour <$$paren> thought it
the surest means for the winning of the Hearts of the Citizens unto him
, ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.208

and so in that hope he entered the City , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.209

and cut his Body over-thwart , to the end they might conjecture he had
been in danger : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.210

and so by this means held the same Conceit as you and your Complices did
; entering the City of <font> London <$$font> , persuading your selves ,
if they had undertaken your Cause , all would have gone well on your
side . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.211

And now , my Lord , all you have said , or can say , in answer to these
Matters , are but Shadows ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,204.212

and <P_205> therefore , me@ @thinks , it were your best course to
confess , and not to justify . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.213

<font> Essex . <$$font> May it please your Lordship , I must produce
Mr. <font> Bacon <$$font> for a Witness ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.214

for when the Course of private Persecution was in hand , and most
assail'd me , then Mr. <font> Bacon <$$font> was the Man that proffer'd
me Means to the Queen , and drew a Letter in my name , and in his
Brother Sir <font> Nicholas Bacon <$$font> 's name ; which Letter he
purposed to shew the Queen , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.215

and <font> Gosnal <$$font> was the Man that brought them unto me :
wherein I did see Mr. <font> Bacon <$$font> 's Hand pleaded as orderly
, ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.216

and appointed them out that were my Enemies , as directly as might be .
Which Letters I know Mr. Secretary <font> Cecil <$$font> hath seen ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.217

and by him it will appear what Conceit he held of me , and no otherwise
than he here coloureth and pleadeth the contrary .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.218

<font> Bacon . <$$font> My Lord , I spent more hours to make you a good
Subject , than upon any Man in the World besides ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.219

but since you have stirred up this Point , my Lord , I dare Warrant you
this Letter will not blush : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.220

for I did but perform the Part of an honest Man ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.221

and ever laboured to have done you good , if it might have been , and to
no other end ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.222

for what I intended for your Good , was wished from the Heart , without
Touch of any Man's Honour . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.223

<font> Essex . <$$font> Well , my Lord , I do here protest before the
living God , that an honourable , grave , and wise Counsellor hath
lamented and grieved at the Courses he hath seen taken , and therewith
hath wished himself often dead ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.224

and this I speak upon credible and honourable Information :
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.225

But I can prove thus much from Sir <font> Robert Cecil <$$font> 's own
Mouth ; that he , speaking to one of his Fellow-Counsellors , should say
, that none in the World but the Infanta of <font> Spain <$$font> had
Right to the Crown of <font> England . <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.226

Here Sir <font> Robert Cecil <$$font> stepped forth into the Court
<paren> having kept himself private till then <$$paren>
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.227

and humbly desired leave to speak to <font> Essex . <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.228

Sir <font> R. Cecil . <$$font> The Difference between you and me is
great ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.229

for I speak in the Person of an honest Man , and you , my Lord , in the
Person of a Traitor : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.230

so well I know , you have Wit at will . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.231

The Preheminence hath been yours , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.232

but I have Innocence , Truth of Conscience , and Honesty , to defend me
against the Scandal of slanderous Tongues , and aspiring Hearts ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.233

and I protest before God , I have loved your Person , and justified your
Virtues : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.234

and I appeal to God and the Queen , that I told her Majesty , your
Afflictions would make you a fit Servant for her .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.235

And had I not seen your ambitious Affections inclined to Usurpation , I
could have gone on my Knees to her Majesty to have done you good ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.236

but you have a Sheep's Garment in show , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.237

and in appearance are humble and religious ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.238

but God be thanked , we know you : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.239

for indeed your Religion appears by <font> Blunt , Davis <$$font> and
<font> Tresham <$$font> , your chiefest Counsellors for the present :
and by promising Liberty of Conscience hereafter .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.240

I stand for Loyalty , which I never lost ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.241

you stand for Treachery , wherewith your Heart is possess'd :
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.242

and you charge me with high things , wherein I defy you to the vttermost
. ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.243

You , my good Lords , Counsellors of State , have had many Conferences ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.244

and I do confess I have said the King of <font> Scots <$$font> is a
Competitor , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.245

and you I have said are a Competitor : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.246

you would depose the Queen , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.247

you would be King of <font> England <$$font> , and call a Parliament .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.248

Ah , my Lord , were it but your own Case , the Loss had been the less ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.249

but you have drawn a number of noble Persons and Gentlemen of Birth and
Quality into your Net of Rebellion , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.250

and their Bloods will cry vengeance against you .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.251

For my part , I vow to God , I wish my Soul was in Heaven , and my Body
at rest , so this had never been . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.252

<font> Essex . <$$font> Ah , Mr. Secretary , I thank God for my
Humbling ; that you , in the Ruff of your Bravery , came to make your
Oration against me here this day . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.253

<font> Cecil . <$$font> My Lord , I humbly thank God that you did not
take me for a fit Companion for you and your Humours ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.254

for if you had , you would have drawn me to betray my Sovereign , as you
have done : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.255

but I would have you name the Counsellor you speak of ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.256

name him , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.257

name him , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.258

name him if you dare , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.259

if you dare , I defy you ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.260

name him if you dare . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.261

<font> Essex . <$$font> Here stands an honourable Person <paren>
meaning the Earl of <font> Southampton <$$font> <$$paren> that knows I
speak no Fables ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.262

he heard it as well as I . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.263

<font> Cecil . <$$font> Then , my Lord of <font> Southampton <$$font> ,
I adjure you by the Duty you owe to God , Loyalty and Allegiance you owe
to your Sovereign , by all Tokens of true Christianity , and by the
antient Friendship and Acquaintance once between us , that you name the
Counsellor . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.264

<font> Southampt. <$$font> Mr. Secretary , if you will needs have me
name the Counsellor , it was Mr. Comptroller .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.265

Whereupon the Secretary falling down upon his Knees , said , I thank God
for this day ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.266

and upon his knee desired the Lord High Steward , that a Gentleman of
the Privy-Chamber <paren> or one that might have access to the Queen
<$$paren> might go , and humbly intreat her Highness to command Mr.
Comptroller to come before his Grace . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.267

Hereupon the Lord High Steward calling Mr. <font> Knevet <$$font>
<paren> a Gentleman of her Majesty's Privy-Chamber <$$paren> said unto
him , Go , Mr. <font> Knevet <$$font> , unto her Majesty ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.268

and let her understand Mr. Secretary's Demand .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.269

<font> Cecil . <$$font> Mr. <font> Knevet <$$font> , you shall have
free access unto her Majesty ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.270

tell her , that I vow before the God of Heaven , that if she refuse to
send Mr. Comptroller , whereby I may clear my self of these open
Scandals , I will rather die at her foot , <paren> as her Subject and
Vassal <$$paren> than live to do her any more Service in this honourable
degree , wherein her Highness employs me .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.271

And withal , let me adjure you , Mr. <font> Knevet <$$font> , that you
do not acquaint Mr. Comptroller with the Cause why you come for him .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.272

Mr. <font> Knevet <$$font> went , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.273

and not long after return'd with Mr. Comptroller , to whom the Lord
High Steward repeated the Cause why he was sent for ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.274

and desir'd him to satisfy the Lords , whether Mr. Secretary did use
any such Speech in his Hearing , or to his Knowledge .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.275

<font> Mr. Comptroller . <$$font> I remember that once in Mr.
Secretary's Company , there was a Book read , that treated of such
matters ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.276

but I never did hear Mr. Secretary use any such words , or to that
effect . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.277

Whereupon Mr. Secretary thanked God , that tho' the Earl stood there as
a Traitor , yet he was found an honest Man , and a faithful Subject :
withal saying , I beseech God to forgive you for this open wrong done
unto me , as I do openly pronounce I forgive you from the bottom of my
Heart . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.278

<font> Essex . <$$font> And I , Mr. Secretary , do clearly and freely
forgive you with all my Soul ; because I mean to die in Charity .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.279

<font> Bacon . <$$font> My Lord , you may now perceive that my Lord of
<font> Essex <$$font> went about to procure matter , and to give over on
the instant . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,205.280

<P_206>

<font> South. <$$font> Well , I beseech your Lordship , let me satisfy
your Lordship and the rest thus much , that for my own part , I did
never know the Laws . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.282

Now , to shew the Causes that made me adventure so far as I did :
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.283

The first occasion that made me adventure into these Courses , was the
Affinity betwixt my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> and me , I being of
his Blood , and marrying his Kinswoman ; so that for his sake I should
have hazarded my Life : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.284

But what I have by my forwardness offended in Act , I am altogether
ignorant , but in Thought I am assured never .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.285

And if thro' my ignorance in the Law I have offended , yet I humbly
submit my self to her Majesty , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.286

and from the bottom of my Heart do beg her gracious Pardon , if it
please her : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.287

and I hope that neither your Lordship nor any of the Peers will hold any
of the former Resolutions spoken of by these Orators for any certainty ,
which depends no otherwise than one upon another .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.288

For if any foolish Speeches have passed , I protest , as I shall be
saved , that they were never purposed by me , nor understood to be so
purposed by me , to the hurt of her Majesty's Person .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.289

<font> Essex . <$$font> I beseech your Lordship to understand me , and
assure your self , that what I now speak , is not with any desire
<paren> I protest <$$paren> to spare one drop of my Blood ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.290

and because some Honourable Persons are interested in the Cause , I
would <paren> under favour <$$paren> signify , because the Point hath
been so much urged by Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> , that at our being
in <font> London <$$font> when we were past <font> Pauls <$$font> , word
was brought me , that the Chain was drawn at <font> Ludgate <$$font> ,
and that my Lord of <font> Cumberland <$$font> was there : which when I
heard , I was right glad ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.291

for if there had been cause , I would have been glad to put my self into
so honourable a Person's hands as his : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.292

but it was a false Report , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.293

for my Lord was not then come thither . After which I sent to Sheriff
<font> Smith <$$font> 's House , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.294

and after my coming thither , I sent the Sheriff and Mr. Alderman
<font> Watts <$$font> to my Lord Mayor , desiring him to come to us ; if
he would not , to send four of his Aldermen to see if we demeaned our
selves loyally , with intent to put our selves into their Hands to use
us as they would , or to put us into any Prison ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.295

yet in regard of our private Enemies , and the fear of their Treachery ,
we desired them to shut their Gates : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.296

and this was the end for which we went into the City .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.297

<font> Attor. <$$font> My Lord , if you had no other Purpose , why did
you go into <font> Grace-Church-Street <$$font> and <font>
Fen-Church-Street <$$font> , crying out all the way you went , <font>
England <$$font> is bought and sold to the <font> Spaniard ! <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.298

<font> Southamp. <$$font> Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> , I protest
<paren> as I hope to have Mercy in Heaven <$$paren> I never heard my
Lord speak any such Word , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.299

neither did I hear of the Proclamation you speak of , made by my Lord
<font> Burleigh <$$font> and the Herald at Arms ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.300

neither did I see them : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.301

and I deny <paren> my Soul and Conscience bearing me Witness <$$paren>
that I ever knew of any Intent and Meaning , or did ever mean or intend
any Treason , Rebellion , or other Action against my Sovereign or the
State ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.302

but only what I did , was to assist my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> in
his private Quarrel ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.303

and therefore , Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> , you have urged the
matter very far , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.304

and you wrong me therein , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.305

my Blood be upon your Head . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.306

As for my Lord of <font> Rutland <$$font> , whereas he inferreth against
me to be a persuader and inviter of my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> to
these Actions , he wrongeth me exceedingly ;
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.307

for he was never the Man that saw me once discontented ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.308

and therefore had small ground or reason so to say .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.309

And you , Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> , whereas you charge me for a
Papist , I protest most unfeignedly , I was never conversant with any of
that sort ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.310

I only knew one <font> White <$$font> , a Priest , that went up and down
the Town , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.311

yet did I never converse with him in all my Life .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.312

<font> Essex . <$$font> My Lord , and you that be our Peers , I beseech
you give me hearing thus far ; not that I will speak it for the
safeguard of my Life , but with this my desire ,
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.313

I charge the Souls of all them that be our Censurers or Triers : because
out of a Form and Custom of speaking , these Orators would make them
more odious that come to the Bar , that I may not be thought to have
done this upon Revenge : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.314

for within these few days I purposed to have received the Communion , to
be a Testimony that I was far from bearing of Malice to any , not so
much as {I_would_bear} to my private Enemies .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.315

But the falling out between the Earl of <font> Southampton <$$font> and
the Lord <font> Grey <$$font> , happening on a <font> Sunday <$$font> ,
hindered my Intent ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.316

for so soon as I knew of it , I found my Affections to stir on it
exceedingly : ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.317

yet I have since that time laboured , and by my Prayers to God earnestly
desired , that I might be armed with Patience to endure all Afflictions
. ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.318

And here I protest before the ever-living God , as he may have Mercy on
me , That my Conscience is clear from any disloyal Thought or Harm to
her Majesty ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.319

and my desire ever hath been to be free from Bloodshed , as Mr. <font>
Dove <$$font> can witness . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.320

But if in all my Thoughts and Purposes I did not ever desire the good
Estate of my Sovereign and Country , as of my own Soul ; I beseech the
Lord then shew some Mark upon me and my Soul in this place , for a just
Vengeance of my Untruths to all the World .
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.321

And God , which knoweth the Secrets of all Hearts , knoweth that I never
sought the Crown of <font> England <$$font> , nor ever wished to a
higher degree than a Subject . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.322

I greatly endeavoured to have brought my Conscience to peace , only by
seeking to secure my Access to the Presence of the Queen , that I might
speedily have unfolded my Griefs unto her Majesty against my private
Enemies ; but not to have shed one drop of their Blood :
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.323

And this , my Lord , I speak , to the end I might put off all imputation
of being an Hypocrite , or an Atheist ; ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.324

for I was never Papist , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.325

neither did I ever favour any Sectary <paren> as my Lord of <font>
Canterbury <$$font> knoweth , and can testify <$$paren> :
ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.326

for my Religion , it is sound , ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.327

and as I live , I mean to die in it . ESSEXSTATE-1600-E2-P2,206.328
