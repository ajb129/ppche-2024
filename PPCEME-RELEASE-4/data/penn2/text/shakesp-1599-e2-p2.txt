Next to be compas'd like a good Bilbo in the circumference of a Pecke ,
hilt to point , heele to head . SHAKESP-1599-E2-P2,53.C1.518

And then to be stopt in like a strong distillation with stinking
Cloathes , that fretted in their owne grease :
SHAKESP-1599-E2-P2,53.C1.519

thinke of that , a man of my Kidney ; SHAKESP-1599-E2-P2,53.C1.520

it was a miracle to scape suffocation . SHAKESP-1599-E2-P2,53.C1.522

And in the height of this Bath <paren> when I was more then halfe stew'd
in grease <paren> like a Dutchdish <$$paren> to be throwne into the
