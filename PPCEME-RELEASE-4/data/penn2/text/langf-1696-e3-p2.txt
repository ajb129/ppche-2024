<P_46>

<font> Sect. <$$font> 4 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,46.3

I am now going to discribe another way that I never read of , neither
ever knew more than one that used it , and he a skilful Gardiner and
us'd it very much : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,46.4

Knowing no name for it I have given it the name of <font> Side-graffing
<$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,46.5

It@ @'s done by preparing the <font> Scion <$$font> as in <font>
Whip-graffing <$$font> ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,46.6

then without cutting off the head of the <font> Stock <$$font> , <paren>
but making it thin of side Branches <$$paren> from a smooth place of it
on the <font> West-side <$$font> , take off as much <font> bark <$$font>
as the <font> Scion <$$font> will cover <paren> as in <font> Packing
<$$font> <$$paren> LANGF-1696-E3-P2,46.7

and slit both <font> Scion <$$font> and <font> Stock <$$font> ,
according to the directions given of Lipping or Tonguing in the end of
the last <font> Section <$$font> , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,46.8

and fix them together accordingly : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,46.9

Bind it close LANGF-1696-E3-P2,46.10

and <font> clay <$$font> it . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,46.11

If it grow , at a years end cut off the top of the <font> Stock <$$font>
at the <font> graffed <$$font> place slopewise , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,46.12

and <font> clay <$$font> it . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,46.13

<P_47>

Some done thus grow well , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.15

and I have used it successfully , the transient sap uniting it well to
the <font> Stock <$$font> , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.16

and it groweth fast if the head of the <font> Stock <$$font> be not too
big to rob it of the sap and drop upon it , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.17

therefore suffer not the top of the <font> Stock <$$font> much to
over_grow the <font> Scion <$$font> the first year before it@ @'s cut
quite off . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.18

There is another way of this kind , I have known used ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.19

and is easier done than the former , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.20

that is , to slit the <font> bark <$$font> of the <font> Stock <$$font>
in the form of a great T , and loosening it with the point of a Knife ,
and then clapping in a <font> Scion <$$font> , prepared as hath been
said before , <paren> but without the slit for <font> Lipping <$$font> ,
<$$paren> LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.21

<font> bind <$$font> and <font> clay <$$font> it .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.22

This can be used only when the bark will part from the <font> Stock
<$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.23

<font> Sect. <$$font> 5 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.24

The next way is that which is called <font> Graffing <$$font> in the
<font> Cleft <$$font> , and is very ancient , and still used by <font>
common-Planters <$$font> , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.25

and it@ @'s thus performed . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.26

Cut off the head of the <font> Stock <$$font> even and smooth ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.27

cleave it with a strong <font> Knife <$$font> , or <font> Chissel
<$$font> , <paren> hereafter described when I speak of <font> Pruning
<$$font> big Trees <$$paren> LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.28

let the slit run near two inches deep , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.29

let it be as near the middle of the <font> stock <$$font> as you can ,
but not in the <font> pith <$$font> or <font> heart <$$font> ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,47.30

have in readiness a stick of hard Wood , near a foot <P_48> long , at
one end made like a <font> wedge <$$font> ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.31

when you have taken out the <font> Cleaver <$$font> , put the <font>
wedg <$$font> into the <font> slit <$$font> , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.32

and open it so wide as to put in the <font> Scion <$$font> , when it@
@'s prepared . Which is by cutting it down <font> slope <$$font> on
each side , about an inch in length , beginning at the joynt , but
leaving it much thinner on that side that goeth into the <font> Stock
<$$font> than the other that is outward , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.33

<paren> that side must be outward that will cause it to lean rather
<font> outward <$$font> than <font> inward <$$font> ; <$$paren>
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.34

you may let it have a shoulder on one side , or both , or neither ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.35

all these ways are used ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.36

but shouldering takes up more time , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.37

and makes the <font> Scion weaker <$$font> , and so apter by any chance
to be broke off . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.38

Then with your Knife cut away any <font> jags <$$font> , or <font>
roughness <$$font> , or <font> blackness <$$font> that remains after
cleaving on each side of the <font> cleft <$$font> within ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.39

and so put in either <font> one <$$font> or <font> two Scions <$$font>
<paren> according as your <font> stock <$$font> is in bigness ,
<$$paren> LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.40

place them so as the passage of the <font> sap <$$font> betwixt the
<font> bark <$$font> and <font> wood <$$font> , both of the <font> Stock
<$$font> and <font> Scion <$$font> , may meet all along the <font> cleft
<$$font> , as near as you can ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.41

draw then forth your <font> wedge <$$font> , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.42

and if the stock be a big strong stock , and do pinch the <font> Graffs
<$$font> , drive a little wedge of dry wood into the <font> slit
<$$font> , but not so as to let the <font> Scions <$$font> loose ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,48.43

<P_49_misnumbered_as_59>

or for such strong stocks cut the <font> Graffs <$$font> as thick on
that side that goes into the stock , as on the outside , which will
prevent the stocks hurting the sappy part and <font> bark <$$font> of
the Scion . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.45

Many cleave big stocks cross-wise again ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.46

and put in two more <font> Scions <$$font>
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.47

but cleaving hurts the stock so much that you had better <paren> if you
will have more than two <font> Scions <$$font> in one stock <$$paren>
<font> Graff <$$font> the other two in the bark , according to the
<font> second <$$font> way of <font> Graffing <$$font> , forecasting one
of them to be on the <font> West-side <$$font> of the <font> stock
<$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.48

<font> Sect. <$$font> 6 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.49

There is another way , called <font> Graffing <$$font> by <font>
Approach , Ablactation , <$$font> or <font> Enarching <$$font> , which
is by having a <font> stock <$$font> , or <font> stocks <$$font> grow so
near another Tree , whose <font> Fruit <$$font> you would propagate ,
that the <font> stock <$$font> and the <font> branch <$$font> of that
Tree may be joyned together in the manner following ; or else <font>
stocks <$$font> raised in <font> Pots <$$font> , that may be placed near
the Tree of whose kind you would propagate ; as is commonly used for
<font> Orange-Trees <$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.50

Cut the side of the <font> Branch <$$font> and of the <font> stock
<$$font> <paren> where they will meet <$$paren> about three inches in
length , till you come near the <font> pith <$$font> of each ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.51

and fit them both together , that the passages of the sap may joyn , in
which posture <font> bind <$$font> and <font> clay <$$font> them :
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.52

As@ @soon <P_50> as you find the <font> Scion <$$font> and <font> Stock
<$$font> to be well cemented together , cut off the head of the <font>
Stock <$$font> , about four inches above the binding ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,50.53

and in <font> March <$$font> following , cut off the stub you left of
the <font> Stock <$$font> , and also the <font> Scion <$$font>
underneath , close to the Graffed place , that it may subsist by the
Stock only . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,50.54

It@ @'s also used to be done by cutting off the head of the <font> Stock
<$$font> at first , and sloping half off about two inches long , and
joyning the <font> Scion <$$font> thereunto , being cut accordingly .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,50.55

<font> See the figure . <$$font> LANGF-1696-E3-P2,50.56

This manner of <font> Graffing <$$font> is unnecessary , and scarcely
practicable in the <font> Fruit-Trees <$$font> , chiefly intended in
this Book ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,50.57

but for <font> Oranges , Limons , Pomgranates , Vines , Jessamins
<$$font> , and such like <font> shrubs <$$font> it may be practis'd .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,50.58

Also it@ @'s said that Trees of different kinds will sooner take this
way than otherwise . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,50.59

Among all these sorts of <font> Graffing <$$font> , the second way for
<font> Apples <$$font> , and the first for all other <font> Fruit-trees
<$$font> , are to be preferred before all the rest .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,50.60

The Figures with these directions , I hope will make all easie to any
mans understanding . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,50.61

CHAP. VI . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,51.64

<font> Observations concerning Graffing . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,51.65

<$$heading>

Sect. <$$font> 1 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,51.67

If the <font> Plants <$$font> that you removed out of your <font>
Seed-plot <$$font> into the <font> Nursery <$$font> , and such <font>
Stocks <$$font> for <font> Stone-fruit <$$font> in the <font> Seed-plot
<$$font> as you intend to <font> Graff <$$font> , be half an inch over
in thickness , where they are to be <font> Graffed <$$font> , or little
more , it@ @'s enough : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,51.68

It@ @'s best not to have them above an inch in the diameter , both that
you may lose no time , and that the <font> Stock <$$font> may be easier
covered by the <font> Scion <$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,51.69

<font> Sect. <$$font> 2 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,51.70

In providing <font> Scions <$$font> or <font> Graffs <$$font> of <font>
Pears , Plums <$$font> and <font> Cherries <$$font> you must observe to
cut them in <font> January <$$font> , or at the very beginning of <font>
February <$$font> , having respect to the forwardness or backwardness of
the Spring , and the warmth or coldness of the Country you live in ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,51.71

but you must be sure to cut them before the buds have any speck of white
appear upon them . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,51.72

<font> Scions <$$font> for <font> Apple-trees <$$font> will seldom be
too forward any time before the beginning of <font> March <$$font> .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,51.73

Choose strong and well grown <font> Scions <$$font> , that grow at the
top or outside of a <font> Tree <$$font> that bears well , and good
fruit of its <P_52> kind , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.74

and cut not off the tops of the <font> Scions <$$font> till you <font>
Graff <$$font> them , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.75

for so they will keep the better . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.76

I have always found a <font> shoot <$$font> or <font> branch <$$font> of
the year next foregoing to thrive best ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.77

and though in <font> Graffing <$$font> old Trees in <font>
Hereford-shire <$$font> , some commend and use <font> Scions <$$font> of
<font> two <$$font> or <font> three <$$font> years growth , yet those
are seldom found to have convenient <font> buds <$$font> to put forth at
, LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.78

and often times have <font> blossoming <$$font> buds on them ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.79

and make not so good a growth , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.80

neither have they so good a <font> joynt <$$font> to <font> Graff
<$$font> at , as those of the last year . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.81

When you get them , you had best cut off at least a hands breadth of
that which grew the year before with them , besides the last years
<font> shoot <$$font> ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.82

for so they will keep the better , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.83

and you must use about an inch of that old wood in every <font> Scion
<$$font> when you <font> Graff <$$font> it . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.84

<font> Sect. <$$font> 3 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,52.85

In <font> January <$$font> or <font> February <$$font> , as you find the
weather grow warm , the wind not being <font> North <$$font> , or <font>
North-East <$$font> , you may Graff <font> Plums , Cherries <$$font> ,
and <font> Pears <$$font> , but not <font> Apples <$$font> till the
<font> bark <$$font> of the <font> Stocks <$$font> will <font> rise
<$$font> or <font> peel <$$font> from the wood , which is seldom before
the middle of <font> March <$$font> , and often not till <font> April
<$$font> , because this is necessary for the best way <P_53> of <font>
Graffing <$$font> them ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,53.86

but if you will <font> Graff <$$font> any <font> Apples <$$font> in the
<font> cleft <$$font> , you may do it a little sooner .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,53.87

Perhaps you may not have several sorts of <font> Plums , Cherries
<$$font> or <font> Pears <$$font> , so near you as that you may get
<font> buds <$$font> fresh enough for <font> Inoculation <$$font> .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,53.88

In this case you may procure <font> Scions <$$font> and <font> Graff
<$$font> them , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,53.89

and they will continue fresh though you should send for them from beyond
Sea . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,53.90

<font> Sect. <$$font> 4 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,53.91

These <font> Scions <$$font> may be kept three <font> weeks <$$font> ,
or a <font> month <$$font> after they are cut , before they are used ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,53.92

and there ought to be a <font> fortnight <$$font> or <font> three weeks
<$$font> betwixt the time of their being <font> cut <$$font> , and of
their being <font> Graffed <$$font> , that the <font> Stocks <$$font> in
that time may be more replenisht with <font> sap <$$font> , and the
<font> Scions <$$font> be more empty of it . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,53.93

To keep your <font> Scions <$$font> or <font> Graffs <$$font> after they
are cut , you need not , as some direct , bury them in <font> moist mold
<$$font> , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,53.94

for this may be a means to make them swell and bud forth , by receiving
moisture from the <font> Earth <$$font> ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,53.95

and then when by <font> Graffing <$$font> they are exposed to the cold
open <font> Air <$$font> , they will be in danger to wither and die
before they have nourishment from the <font> Stock <$$font> .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,53.96

<P_54>

You may lay them in a dry house , so it be near no heat , or under an
old Tree , or Hedge , and cover them all over with <font> dry mold
<$$font> , that the <font> Air <$$font> may not have too much influence
upon them : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,54.98

though they seem somewhat dry , yet if they cut with a fresh colour ,
and be not much withered , they will not grow the worse , but rather the
better ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,54.99

yea some that have seemed withered , being carried in a Cloak-bag <font>
seventy <$$font> or <font> eighty <$$font> miles have grown well .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,54.100

Suffer not the <font> buds <$$font> to be hurt , or rub'd in the <font>
binding <$$font> or <font> carriage <$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,54.101

<font> Sect. <$$font> 5 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,54.102

There be some indifferent whether they <font> Graff <$$font> at a <font>
joynt <$$font> or no , but forecast to have a <font> bud <$$font>
directly behind the <font> shoulder <$$font> of the <font> Scion
<$$font> : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,54.103

If <font> Scions <$$font> with <font> joynts <$$font> were scarce , you
might practise so on small <font> Stocks <$$font> that will be speedily
cover'd , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,54.104

but if <font> Scions <$$font> can be had with <font> joints <$$font> ,
never <font> Graff <$$font> with others , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,54.105

for these will cover the <font> Stocks <$$font> sooner .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,54.106

It will do well in <font> Graffing Stocks <$$font> for large <font>
Standards <$$font> , to put but one <font> Scion <$$font> into a Stock ,
and if it put forth several <font> shoots <$$font> to cut off all but
one , that is the straightest and strongest . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,54.107

But for <font> Dwarfs <$$font> and <font> Wall-fruit <$$font> put in
<font> two Scions <$$font> , if the <font> Stock <$$font> be big enough
. LANGF-1696-E3-P2,54.108

Let the latter be <P_55> <font> Graffed <$$font> near the ground , the
former at such height as the <font> Stock <$$font> will allow .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,55.109

<font> Sect. <$$font> 6 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,55.110

In <font> Graffing <$$font> or <font> Inoculating <$$font> , it may be
necessary to have some <font> mark <$$font> , to know what kind of
<font> Fruit <$$font> is put upon each Stock ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,55.111

if you Graff many of one kind , <paren> as it@ @'s necessary for <font>
Syder-Fruit <$$font> <$$paren> you may observe to make every <font> row
<$$font> to consist but of one kind , and no other ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,55.112

but in a Book , that such a row hath such a kind of <font> Fruit
<$$font> in it , and it@ @'s but entring where there are several in one
row , there may be a Stake knockt into the ground at the beginning of
every new sort , and so entred in your Book ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,55.113

and where you have very few of a kind <paren> or for your whole <font>
Nursery <$$font> , if you please <$$paren> you may make <font> marks
<$$font> of several <font> figures <$$font> or shapes , in the <font>
bark <$$font> of the <font> Stocks <$$font> ; which <font> marks
<$$font> enter into your Book , and what <font> kind <$$font> it denotes
, LANGF-1696-E3-P2,55.114

and at two or three years when you remove it , the mark will be very
visible ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,55.115

and by renewing the marks sometimes , you may continue it as long as you
please , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,55.116

and if any Tree be stolen you may own it by the mark .

CHAP. VIII . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,56.120

<font> Of Planting Wall-Fruit . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,56.121

<$$heading>

Sect. <$$font> 1 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,56.123

<font> Stone-fruit <$$font> will be first ready to remove ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,56.124

for after two years growth in the Seed-plot or Nursery , after they are
Inoculated , or Graffed , you may well remove them , be they for <font>
Wall <$$font> or <font> Dwarfs <$$font> , which you ought to do in
<font> October <$$font> or <font> November <$$font> ; early removing ,
being advantageous for all <font> Fruit-Trees <$$font> , both for the
security of their growing , and for their well growing .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,56.125

Young <font> Trees <$$font> , having been taken up about <font> November
<$$font> , and the ends of the roots cut off , and laid in the Earth
till <font> March <$$font> to be Planted , being then taken forth again
, it hath appeared that they have put out many fibrous roots , at the
ends of those big roots that were cut off ; which had they done in the
place they were to grow in the next Summer , this would have been a good
preparation against Spring ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,56.126

and it@ @'s always seen that Trees set in <font> February <$$font> or
<font> March <$$font> , make generally a much less growth the next
<P_57> year , than those that were set before Winter .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.127

If a dry Summer happen to succeed , it often kills some of the late set
Trees , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.128

and puts such a stop to others , that they recover not of many years .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.129

In sharp Frosts , though you could dig , it@ @'s not good to remove
Trees . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.130

Yet if you have a few small <font> Trees <$$font> near hand to remove ,
you may make advantage of a small <font> Frost <$$font> , by removing
them , in getting up the <font> Earth <$$font> whole about the roots of
the Tree , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.131

and set it presently letting as little Earth <font> fall <$$font> from
them as may be , whereby the Tree may be scarcely sensible of <font>
removing <$$font> : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.132

And at all times if you have not far to carry the <font> Trees <$$font>
to set them , knock not off the mold from the <font> roots <$$font> ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.133

but preserve as much as you can about them . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.134

<font> Sect. <$$font> 2 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.135

Make a Trench by the Wall-side you are to set them up to , about two
foot broad , and as deep , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.136

and in every place where a Tree is to be set , about a yard square ,
mingle good <font> old rotten Neats-dung <$$font> , with the Earth ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.137

and fill it up lightly , near as high as you intend the borders to be ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.138

and tread it down ; So that it be not above half full in the places you
designed to set the trees , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.139

as to the borders make them up when you please .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,57.140

<P_58>

But if you design no borders , make then only a hole for each Tree , of
the square before mentioned : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,58.142

And if your <font> Soil <$$font> be <font> wet <$$font> , or <font>
binding gravel <$$font> , or such like , very bad in the bottom , go not
so deep , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,58.143

it will be better to set them shallow , and raise the Earth about them .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,58.144

I knew an excellent <font> Planter <$$font> , that in a blewish clay
ground , used at the bottom of the <font> hole <$$font> to set a broad
stone , to prevent the Roots of the <font> Trees <$$font> in runing
downward , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,58.145

and certainly where the Land is spungy or bad in the bottom , you can@
@not set the Trees too shallow ; so that the Earth be deep enough above
them to prevent the Sun's burning them the Summer .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,58.146

As to the distance <font> Wall-fruit-trees <$$font> are to be set at ,
where they are apt to grow , you may learn that best by considering
their aptness to spread : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,58.147

<font> Apricocks <$$font> and <font> Pears <$$font> spread most ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,58.148

the <font> May Cherry <$$font> and some others are of very small growth
: LANGF-1696-E3-P2,58.149

it@ @'s impossible to give rules for all , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,58.150

but the general distance is about four yards asunder .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,58.151

<font> Sect. <$$font> 3 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,58.152

If it be not a manur'd Land you set them in , have in readiness some
very <font> fine rich Mold <$$font> , or <font> shovellings <$$font> of
a yard <P_59> where Cattle are frequently lodged or fed , that hath lain
on heaps till it@ @'s <font> mellow <$$font> , and become dry , or
<font> rotten Neats-dung <$$font> , which you may mix with the Earth
that came forth of the hole , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.153

and so order it , that it may be as good or better , than that out of
which your Trees came : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.154

Fill the hole half way up with this , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.155

and tread it down in such form <paren> having respect to the <font>
roots <$$font> of the Tree that is set in it <$$paren> that the <font>
roots <$$font> may rest close upon it . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.156

Cut off the ends of all the <font> roots <$$font> ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.157

<paren> if it chance to have one long downright <font> root <$$font> ,
you may cut it almost half off , <$$paren> LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.158

try <paren> by setting the Tree in the hole <$$paren> which side will
stand best to the Wall , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.159

and then cut off such branches as grow directly toward , and fromward
the Wall , leaving only the side branches , to be nail'd unto it ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.160

then clap your Tree in , placing it as far from the Wall as the <font>
top <$$font> will allow , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.161

that must be spread upon it , that the <font> roots <$$font> may have
the more liberty to spread backwards : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.162

fill up the hole with the <font> mold <$$font> , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.163

and use all diligence to place the <font> roots <$$font> of your Tree in
the same posture they were in before you removed it .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,59.164

If the Tree be young , and the <font> Roots <$$font> slender , this can
be performed no way but by throwing in a little soil at a time , <P_60>
and then raising up with your hands such <font> Roots <$$font> as are
pressed down by it below their proper situation , spreading them on the
soil you have cast in , and then throwing in more , and ordering the
Roots as before , so continuing to do till you have filled up the hole .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,60.165

Old Trees with sturdy Roots do not require so much curiosity ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,60.166

but you must be sure that the mold lie close under , betwixt , and among
the Roots . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,60.167

If the <font> Soil <$$font> be <font> light <$$font> , you must press it
down gently with your foot , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,60.168

when you have finished placing the Earth about them , you may <paren> if
the Land be stiff , cold , wet , or barren <$$paren> cover the Earth
with Dung , round about the Tree , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,60.169

but if the Land be good , or that you can@ @not spare Dung , then in the
end of <font> February <$$font> following cover the Earth with <font>
Fearn <$$font> or <font> Straw <$$font> almost a foot thick ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,60.170

and this do then , rather than when you set the Tree that Earth may have
more benefit of the Frost and Wet in the Winter to temper it .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,60.171

And some in setting Trees esteem it best to put no Dung into the holes ,
but the soil that came forth of it , both under and about the <font>
Roots <$$font> , placing the smallest and best mold next them , <P_61>
laying a good quantity of Dung on the top of the Earth about them .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.172

<font> Sect. <$$font> 4 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.173

Every year it will be necessary to <font> prune <$$font> and <font> nail
<$$font> them to the Wall , <font> twice <$$font> , or <font> thrice
<$$font> , according as they grow more or less ; wherein you must
observe , to bend down the strongest <font> shoots <$$font> <paren> that
would grow upward <$$paren> towards the sides , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.174

otherwise they will be apt to run straight upward , and not cover the
space you design for them , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.175

and by their luxurious growth , will extreamly rob the side branches of
their nourishment . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.176

There will branches enow spring out fresh to run upwards out of them
when they are so bowed . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.177

Lay none a-cross or under one another , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.178

but let them spread as the fingers of your hand when it is expanded .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.179

Cut off such as grow directly outward close to the body ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.180

if you cut a part of any branch off , do it at the bud , that the cut
may be covered with a fresh sprig . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.181

The <font> Winter pruning <$$font> may be done as soon as the <font>
fruit <$$font> , and leaves are fallen , or any time before <font>
February <$$font> , except <font> Nectarines <$$font> , and <font>
Peaches <$$font> , which are apt to die , if prun'd before the Sap raise
. LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.182

Mr. <font> Rea <$$font> saith , the best time to Prune them , is after
they flower . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,61.183

<P_62>

Shreads of Wollen Cloth are the best things to Nail them up with ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,62.185

some use gentle Leather , or an old Hat , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,62.186

any of these may serve turn . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,62.187

<font> Sect. <$$font> 5 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,62.188

Sometime in the Winter , after <font> two <$$font> or <font> three
<$$font> years , if the <font> Soil <$$font> the <font> roots <$$font>
are to spread into , be not <font> rich <$$font> enough , open the
ground at the outside of the <font> holes <$$font> you made at setting ,
as near round about , as the Wall will permit . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,62.189

If you find no roots bare , let it lye open a month ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,62.190

and then fill it up with the Earth that came forth , well mixt with such
a <font> manure <$$font> as suits with it . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,62.191

<font> Sect. <$$font> 6 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,62.192

Where the natural <font> soil <$$font> is not good enough of it self ,
whether it be in <font> Garden , Orchard <$$font> , or <font> Field
<$$font> , there it ought to be by skill assisted , and better'd , at
least-wise for such a compass as the <font> roots <$$font> of every Tree
take up for some time , if not so far round as they are ever like to
extend themselves . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,62.193

And this must be done by mixing such <font> Manures <$$font> with the
<font> Soil <$$font> , as suit best with its temper .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,62.194

If the <font> Soil <$$font> be <font> clay <$$font> , or <font> clay
<$$font> mixt with <font> gravel <$$font> , or <font> wet heavy Land ,
hot Dung <$$font> , as that of <font> Horses <$$font> , or <font>
Poultry <$$font> , is best to mix with it , to bring it to a due
temperament . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,62.195

<P_63>

And if the <font> soil <$$font> be a <font> light , hollow , eskie
<$$font> , or <font> sandy land <$$font> , then <font> Marl , Mud
<$$font> out of a Pond or River , or <font> shovellings <$$font> of
<font> dirty yards <$$font> or <font> high-ways <$$font> , if they be
not <font> sandy <$$font> , and be well <font> mellowed <$$font> , by
lying on heaps , and especially if those heaps are mixed with Lime , are
proper to mend it . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,63.197

If this last <font> soil <$$font> be <font> barren <$$font> likewise ,
you may properly add a mixture of <font> Neats-dung <$$font> .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,63.198

If your Land be too rich <paren> which is seldom seen <$$paren> you may
mix Gravel or cold clay with it . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,63.199

I have seen an <font> Apple-tree <$$font> on a <font> Hemp-but <$$font>
, which was constantly Plowed , and Manur'd to a great richness , bear
more <font> Apples <$$font> than four such Trees in an <font> Orchard
<$$font> would do . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,63.200

And it@ @'s constantly seen in <font> barren hungry Land <$$font> ,
Trees thrive poorly , grow <font> Mossey <$$font> , or <font> Bark-bound
<$$font> , bearing very little , and that a very poor <font> Fruit
<$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,63.201

Only <font> Wallnut-trees <$$font> and <font> Pear-trees <$$font> , do
not necessarily require a very <font> rich ground <$$font> ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,63.202

and will prosper best on stony and light Land . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,63.203

<font> Sect. <$$font> 7 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,63.204

When your <font> Wall-trees <$$font> are grown old , and full of big
Wood , you may in three or four years time renew them , by cutting out
some of the biggest <font> stems <$$font> , or <font> boughs <$$font> ,
yearly ; cutting <P_64> each branch off at some small twig , <paren> if
it may be <$$paren> that either it , or a fresh branch may {SIC:my} grow
over the cut place ; which must be kept covered with Clay ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,64.205

and so go on yearly , till all the big wood is cut out .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,64.206

Or if you dislike the kind of <font> Fruit <$$font> , you may <font>
Inoculate <$$font> , or <font> Graff <$$font> the boughs with a better
sort of <font> Fruit <$$font> , but not all in one year , but some one ,
and some another . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,64.207

By either of these ways , you may renew a decaying Tree , and keep your
<font> Wall <$$font> almost still furnished , with less trouble and
charge , or loss of time than by taking up the old one , and <font>
planting <$$font> a young one in its stead . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,64.208

If the <font> Tree <$$font> be so old , that you resolve to take it up ,
and plant another in its place , if you have none ready , nor are
willing to buy , the speediest way to be supplyed , you may find
directed in Chapter the first , Section the Ninth .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,64.209

<font> Sect. <$$font> 8 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,64.210

IN furnishing your <font> Walls <$$font> with <font> Fruit-trees
<$$font> , observe always to Plant <font> Peaches <$$font> and <font>
Nectarines <$$font> up to the <font> Wall <$$font> that is most <font>
South-ward <$$font> ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,64.211

the <font> East-Wall <$$font> is to be allotted to <font> Apricocks
<$$font> , early <font> Cherries <$$font> , and the choicest <font>
Plums <$$font> ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,64.212

the <font> West <$$font> may be set with <font> Pears , Cherries
<$$font> , and <font> Plums <$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,64.213

<P_65>

Some of the coursest <font> Pears <$$font> and <font> Plums <$$font> ,
you may set to the <font> North-@ @Wall <$$font> , both to cover the
<font> Wall <$$font> handsomely , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,65.215

and many years they will bear as well on it , as on <font> standards
<$$font> ; especially if your <font> wall <$$font> stand not directly
<font> North <$$font> , but so as to have some considerable benefit of
the Sun ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,65.216

<font> Nut-trees <$$font> likewise are proper for this <font> wall
<$$font> , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,65.217

and will prosper well up to it . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,65.218

For those Autumnal and winter <font> Pears <$$font> , that ripen late ,
the most <font> South <$$font> and highest wall , doth improve them ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,65.219

and they deserve it , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,65.220

neither will some come to maturity in our Climate <paren> some years
<$$paren> without such a wall . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,65.221

I would willingly bestow the best place I had upon one <font>
Winter-Boncreisten <$$font> , two <font> Buryes <$$font> or <font>
Butter Pears <$$font> , two <font> Virgulees <$$font> , and two <font>
Chasseryes <$$font> , a St. <font> Germans <$$font> , St. <font>
Michael <$$font> , the <font> Crasson <$$font> , the <font> Bon-Gerson
<$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,65.222

If your conveniencies will allow it , and you are to build a new <font>
Wall <$$font> , it is much better to have your <font> Garden walls
<$$font> not to stand directly towards the <font> four points <$$font> ,
than otherwise , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,65.223

and then the worst wall will be much better , and the best good enough
for your purpose . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,65.224

<P_66>

As thus , the <font> East-wall <$$font> , to incline to the <font> South
<$$font> ; the <font> South <$$font> , to the <font> West <$$font> ; the
<font> west <$$font> , to the <font> North <$$font> ; the <font> North
<$$font> to the <font> East <$$font> ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,66.226

or contrary , but not so well . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,66.227

In the first way the two first walls will be extraordinary good , and
the two latter good enough for ordinary <font> Fruit <$$font> .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,66.228

<font> Sect. <$$font> 9 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,66.229

In building a new Wall , it would be very advantageous , to make it with
half rounds , each semi-circle being eight yards round in the inside ,
and about six yards in the face or diameter , each taking two Trees ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,66.230

and betwixt every half round , let there be two foot breadth of plain
walling , where you may place a <font> Flower-pot <$$font> on a <font>
pillar two foot <$$font> high , or Plant a <font> Vine <$$font> to run
up it , which every Summer , you may let spread it self a little into
the <font> half rounds <$$font> on each side it .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,66.231

I know an honourable Gentleman , in somewhat a cold Country , that hath
his Garden walls so made , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,66.232

and his Trees bear Fruit plentifully in such years as his neighbours
generally fail . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,66.233

I also saw a <font> wall <$$font> made thus for raising <font> Melons
<$$font> under , by a pattern or directions from <font> Italy <$$font> .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,66.234

<P_67>

I have also seen <font> Grapes <$$font> ripen delicately on every side
the <font> cluster <$$font> , that grew in a <font> half round <$$font>
. LANGF-1696-E3-P2,67.236

By means of these <font> rounds <$$font> , every <font> wall <$$font>
will one time of the day or other , have a share of the Sun ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,67.237

and the best <font> walls <$$font> <paren> by reason of such a
reflection , and collection of the Sun-beams as will be in every <font>
round <$$font> <$$paren> will be exceeding hot , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,67.238

and the <font> Trees <$$font> be more secure from winds .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,67.239

Having said thus much here of the <font> Wall <$$font> that <font> Fruit
trees <$$font> are to be set up to , thus much more may not improperly
be here added . That a <font> Pale <$$font> is as good for this purpose
, and in respect of ripening <font> Fruit <$$font> better than any thing
else it can be raised up to , if the <font> Pale <$$font> be made of
sawed boards , nine or ten foot high , and exactly joined , that no wind
may come through : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,67.240

Next to this in goodness is a <font> Brick-wall <$$font> , and then a
<font> Stone-wall <$$font> , and the worst of all that which is made of
<font> Timber <$$font> and <font> Mortar <$$font> ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,67.241

but in this every one can@ @not be his own chooser ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,67.242

but must comply with what the <font> Country <$$font> he lives in will
permit him to do for his best convenience . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,67.243

When you <font> plant <$$font> your <font> Garden <$$font> with <font>
Fruit trees <$$font> , you may do well to draw <P_68> the <font>
Platform <$$font> of it in Paper , and so set down the name of every
Tree , according to the place it stands in , whether in <font>
Wall-fruit <$$font> or <font> Dwarf-trees <$$font> ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,68.244

the same course you may use about your <font> Orchard <$$font> ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,68.245

and you will find it both satisfactory and useful , that you may readily
at any season of the year , know what kind of <font> Fruit <$$font>
every Tree beareth : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,68.246

The <font> Fruit <$$font> planted in <font> Fields <$$font> , not being
of so much variety , may be easily distinguished without this help .

<font> Concerning Dwarf-Trees . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,68.250

<$$heading>

Sect. <$$font> 1 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,68.252

These <font> Trees <$$font> have been of late much affected and coveted
, because they are of special advantage for Table-fruit , <paren>
whether <font> Pears , Apples , Plums <$$font> <paren> {COM:sic} or
<font> Cherries <$$font> <$$paren> being but of low Stature ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,68.253

and may be <font> planted <$$font> in the <font> borders <$$font> of
<font> Garden-walks <$$font> , without doing any thing else there about
them any prejudice , by overshadowing them ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,68.254

and their <font> fruit <$$font> will be as well secured , and <P_69>
commodious for gathering as the <font> Wall-fruit <$$font> .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,69.255

<font> Sect. <$$font> 2 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,69.256

<font> Plants <$$font> for this purpose must be provided , and prepared
somewhat differently from those for <font> Orchards <$$font> , or <font>
Fields <$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,69.257

The <font> Quince-tree <$$font> is generally used , and best for <font>
Stocks for <font> Pears <$$font> , both for <font> Dwarfs <$$font> and
<font> Wall <$$font> ; as well because it may possibly somewhat
meliorate the <font> Pear <$$font> as <paren> and that chiefly <$$paren>
because it groweth not to that bigness , as on a <font> Pear-stock
<$$font> it would be apt to do . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,69.258

<font> Sect. <$$font> 3 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,69.259

For <font> Dwarf-Apple-trees <$$font> the best <font> Stocks <$$font>
are such as are raised of the <font> cuttings <$$font> of other <font>
Apple-trees <$$font> , as of the <font> Gennet-moil <$$font> , the
<font> Kentish-Codling <$$font> and others . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,69.260

That these are more proper for <font> Dwarf-trees <$$font> , than <font>
Crab-stocks <$$font> , appears ; 1. Because the <font> Fruit <$$font>
will be rather better'd , and not tainted with any asperity , or
roughnesse , as possibly it might be , if <font> Crab tree-stocks
<$$font> were made use of ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,69.261

and one chief design in these <font> Trees <$$font> is to have choice
and delicious Fruit for eating . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,69.262

2 . <font> Apple-trees <$$font> that are raised on such <font> Stocks
<$$font> , will not grow so big as those on <font> Crab-stocks <$$font>
, LANGF-1696-E3-P2,69.263

but are with ease and certainty kept <font> Dwarfs <$$font> .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,69.264

Mr. <font> Rea <$$font> judging <P_70> the <font> Paradise-Apple
<$$font> of somewhat slow growth in bringing forward a <font> Scion
<$$font> , advises to <font> graff <$$font> a <font> Paradise <$$font>
on a <font> Crab-stock <$$font> , and the <font> Fruit <$$font> you
would have , on that <font> Paradise <$$font> , that the <font> Crab
<$$font> might yield plenty of <font> juice <$$font> or <font> sap
<$$font> to the <font> Paradise <$$font> , and the <font> Paradise
<$$font> retard the growth of the <font> Apple planted <$$font> on it ,
so as to keep it a <font> Dwarf <$$font> ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,70.265

but besides loss of time , I doubt the success of this , because the
<font> Crab <$$font> will put forth strong Root ; and yield plenty of
nourishment : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,70.266

For why <font> Apple-trees <$$font> raised by <font> cuttings <$$font>
grow not to be very large Trees , I take to be , their putting forth
such small <font> Roots <$$font> , by which means the Tree hath <font>
sap <$$font> conveyed to it accordingly . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,70.267

3 . By using these <font> cuttings <$$font> for <font> Stocks <$$font>
, you shall get at least four years time , reckoning from sowing the
<font> Crab-kernel <$$font> , and the setting the <font> Stem <$$font>
or <font> Cutting <$$font> , being duly ordered ; As , 1. By setting
the <font> Stem <$$font> in the place you intend the <font> Dwarf-tree
<$$font> shal grow . 2. And setting it in good Earth ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,70.268

for then after one years growth you may <font> Graff <$$font> it ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,70.269

and you will easily discern the advantage in point of time .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,70.270

<P_71>

If it be said <font> Crab-stocks <$$font> ready grown may be made use of
instead of <font> cuttings <$$font> ; there@ @'s this Answer ready ,
They must grow <font> two <$$font> if not <font> three <$$font> years
after they are set before they are fit to <font> graff <$$font> , and in
respect of their large growth will not be fit for <font> Dwarfs <$$font>
. LANGF-1696-E3-P2,71.272

Some <font> Nursery Men <$$font> have made advantage to themselves by
this speedy way of raising Trees by <font> Cuttings <$$font> ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,71.273

but to the disadvantage of them they put them off for <font> planting
<$$font> in <font> Orchards <$$font> , because they are never like to
make large , or long_lasting Trees . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,71.274

<font> Sect. <$$font> 4 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,71.275

The way then to provide these <font> Stocks <$$font> is thus :
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,71.276

In <font> October <$$font> from such <font> Trees <$$font> whose <font>
cuttings <$$font> will grow , take such <font> stems <$$font> , or
<font> branches <$$font> that grow straightest , and which <paren> in
the place where they shall be <font> graffed <$$font> <$$paren> are an
<font> inch <$$font> or more thick , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,71.277

if they be near <font> two inches <$$font> it@ @'s so much the better ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,71.278

cut them off , if you can , a hands breadth below such <font> knots
<$$font> or <font> burrs <$$font> as are on them ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,71.279

for at those <font> burs <$$font> they principally put forth their
<font> Roots <$$font> <$$paren> {COM:no_matching_open_paren}
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,71.280

and cut off the top , that they be not above a yard long ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,71.281

if you can@ @not get them so long of <font> Quinces <$$font> <$$paren>
{COM:no_matching_open_paren} you must be content with shorter ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,71.282

<paren> if they be <font> two foot <$$font> it may do <P_72> reasonably
well {COM:no_matching_close_paren} : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,72.283

Cut off also all side <font> branches <$$font> close to the body ,
except one small twigg near the top , for the Sap to vent it self at ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,72.284

set these presently in <font> beds <$$font> as your <font> Seed-plants
<$$font> were , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,72.285

or rather if your <font> Garden <$$font> be laid out <paren> that you
can know the places they shall stand in <$$paren> set them there .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,72.286

You need not fear setting these as deep , as the length will bear , so
that there be about a <font> foot <$$font> above ground , because they
will shoot out <font> roots <$$font> all along , almost to the top of
the ground , and to spread their <font> roots <$$font> in the good Soil
; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,72.287

and by setting them something deep they are in less danger of dying ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,72.288

and this prevents the trouble of covering the ground about them with
<font> Fearn <$$font> or <font> Straw <$$font> ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,72.289

and by this means likewise they will stand the firmer in the loose
<font> Garden-land <$$font> , for <font> graffing <$$font> at a years
end , and better support a <font> spreading top <$$font> afterwards .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,72.290

<font> Sect. <$$font> 5 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,72.291

But because it@ @'s hard to meet with great plenty of such <font>
branches <$$font> , thus to be cut , and set for <font> stocks <$$font>
, that have <font> burrs <$$font> or <font> knots <$$font> upon them ;
<font> Planters <$$font> have therefore found out a way <paren> which is
called <font> Circumposition <$$font> <$$paren> to bring these <font>
knots <$$font> or <font> burrs <$$font> upon <font> Branches <$$font> ,
that had them not before , and to mend and improve those that before had
them , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,72.292

and the way of it is as followeth . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,72.293

<P_73>

About the beginning of <font> February <$$font> next before you design
to cut these <font> stems <$$font> , directly above the place you intend
to cut them off at , for about a <font> foot <$$font> in length , fasten
about them some Earth in an <font> old Hat <$$font> , or <font> Boot
<$$font> , or <font> Bag <$$font> , made of some strong Cloth : And in
that Earth they will have put forth Roots against the <font> October
<$$font> following , when you are to cut them off to set them .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,73.295

Or <paren> which is a quicker and readier way <$$paren> you may dawb
some <font> wet Earth <$$font> or <font> Clay <$$font> about the place ,
and wrap a <font> Hay-band <$$font> about it , putting some moist Earth
likewise betwixt the <font> rounds <$$font> of the band , and then
running it about again over the spaces betwixt those first <font> rounds
<$$font> of the <font> Hay-band <$$font> and making fast the ends of it
. LANGF-1696-E3-P2,73.296

If the <font> stem <$$font> have no <font> burr <$$font> before you go
either of these ways to work , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,73.297

then first take off here and there a little <font> slice <$$font> of
<font> Bark <$$font> about an <font> inch <$$font> long round about it
near the middle of the place to be covered as hath been directed .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,73.298

Some direct , That before this application of the Earth , about an
<font> inch <$$font> breadth of the <font> Bark <$$font> be taken off ,
round about the part of the <font> branch <$$font> , that is to be
surrounded with the Earth , that <font> roots <$$font> may shoot out in
greater quantity , by coming <P_74> out in the upper <font> skirts
<$$font> of that <font> circle <$$font> , as well as in the lower ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,74.299

but this is but a Crotchet , and grounded <paren> as my Lord <font>
Bacon <$$font> hath truly observed <$$paren> upon the opinion of the
<font> Descension <$$font> of the <font> Sap <$$font> ; whereas indeed
there is no such thing , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,74.300

for the whole mass of <font> Sap <$$font> is always ascending ; in
lesser quantity in the Winter , because the Tree is then only to be
nourished , and kept alive , to which end a small supply is sufficient ,
and yet necessary ; and in greater plenty than {COM:sic} the Summer , to
furnish the Tree with leaves , fruit , and new yearly growth .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,74.301

And the true reason why the <font> leaves <$$font> and <font> fruit
<$$font> fall off towards Winter is , not because the <font> sap
<$$font> returns downward from them , but because they have arrived to
their full ripeness , and the Tree fails by degrees , to convey up so
much Sap as it did in the Summer to them , to produce fresh ones ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,74.302

and therefore consequently that@ @'s an idle mistake too , to think that
the <font> sap <$$font> or <font> juice <$$font> in the Winter , is laid
up in the Roots as a <font> repository <$$font> , as appears plainly ,
inasmuch as they are ever found dryer in the Winter than in the Summer .
So that upon the whole , this taking the <font> Bark <$$font> off round
the <font> branch <$$font> , is good for nothing , but to endanger it ,
by intercepting <P_75> the <font> juice <$$font> or <font> sap <$$font>
, which rises in greatest quantity betwixt the <font> bark <$$font> and
the <font> wood <$$font> ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,75.303

but if , as before was hinted , you take some little <font> slices
<$$font> of the <font> bark <$$font> off round the <font> branch
<$$font> , here and there , leaving the Bark intire in some places ,
this may , by checking the Sap , cause it the more abundantly to pass
into <font> Roots <$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,75.304

But to proceed to the business in hand , you have seen the way of
preparing <font> cuttings <$$font> by <font> circumposition <$$font> ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,75.305

and though some will pretend to raise Trees of any kind by the use of it
, yet it@ @'s certain it avails not , but only in such as by a peculiar
property are apt to put forth <font> Roots <$$font> , being cut off and
set into the ground ; LANGF-1696-E3-P2,75.306

and , those generally known , and made use of this way , are the <font>
Kentish-Codling <$$font> , the <font> Gennet-moil <$$font> , some sorts
of <font> Sweet-Apples <$$font> , and <font> Bitter-sweets <$$font> ,
the <font> Quince-tree <$$font> , the <font> Mulberry-tree <$$font> ,
and the <font> Paradise-Apple-tree <$$font> ; which last is much
commended by the skilful Mr. <font> Rea <$$font> , for to raise <font>
Stocks <$$font> for <font> Dwarf-Apple-trees <$$font> .
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,75.307

<font> Sect. <$$font> 6 . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,75.308

Another way to raise <font> Stocks <$$font> for <font> Dwarf trees
<$$font> , is to cut down some one Tree of little worth , of such a kind
as you want <font> Stocks <$$font> of about a <font> foot <$$font> , or
more from the ground : LANGF-1696-E3-P2,75.309

This will make some kind of Trees very apt to cast forth <P_76> very
good <font> Suckers <$$font> from the old <font> Roots <$$font> ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,76.310

such as are two years growth may be <font> transplanted <$$font> , or
<font> inoculated <$$font> where they stand before removal ;
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,76.311

and the Stump above ground , will also put forth abundance of young
Shoots . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,76.312

After these young <font> shoots <$$font> have grown out of the stump one
year , cast <font> Mold <$$font> , or <font> Earth <$$font> about them ,
a good height ; so that you cover not the <font> tops <$$font> of any of
them ; where let them grow two years more , and they will be well rooted
, LANGF-1696-E3-P2,76.313

then cut them off from the old <font> Stock <$$font> , <paren> which
after that may yield fresh ones again <$$paren> LANGF-1696-E3-P2,76.314

and set the <font> shoots <$$font> you take off as before hath been
directed about Cuttings . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,76.315

These will be about three years longer before they be ready to <font>
graff <$$font> than <font> Cuttings <$$font> , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,76.316

but will be very good young fresh <font> Stocks <$$font> ,
LANGF-1696-E3-P2,76.317

and is a good way to raise <font> Stocks <$$font> of the <font>
Quince-tree <$$font> for <font> Pears <$$font> ; because <font>
Quince-trees <$$font> generally grow so crooked and irregular , that it@
@'s difficult to procure any considerable quantity of them by <font>
Cuttings <$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,76.318

You may gain time in raising <font> Trees <$$font> this way if you
inoculate these young <font> suckers <$$font> or <font> shoots <$$font>
where they stand , as soon as they are big enough , and let them
continue <P_77> there to make one years growth ; by which time they will
be well rooted , and ready to remove . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,77.319

If they shoot up tall after they are molded , you had best top them at a
convenient height , LANGF-1696-E3-P2,77.320

it will make them grow the more in bigness , and so be sooner fit to
<font> graff <$$font> . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,77.321

But if you have a desire to have any of the same kind as the old Tree
was , you need not top them . LANGF-1696-E3-P2,77.322

And by this means if you want <font> Quince-trees , Codlings <$$font> ,
&c. you may be furnished with plenty , that will make better and
handsomer Trees than if you raise them by <font> Cuttings <$$font> .
