Sweette Harte , I nowe begin to thinke my selfe in London , But so to
thinke on it , as I wish my selfe hartely at home againe at little
Thorpe in thy pretty little Armes . KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,86.4

My busines , I hope , wil@ @be at a good periode this weeke , if I can
finde my Lo: Keeper at some convenient Leisuer to Attend him about my
Tower busines . KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,86.5

I have nowe found out all ther cheating plotts , which weare no more
then I have formerly susspected , KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,86.6

And had not my Lo Keepers integritye binn Above ther honesty , I had
been Long since Quitt of that office . KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,86.7

But nowe I am in some hopes that my Lo: Keeper will make good the olde
pattent , And so that I may have it in statue quo prius .
KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,86.8

My other busines with my greate Adversarye , I thinke , will have an end
with his Life , which thay say can@ @not continue Long , he Liing at
this instant very weake & full of disseases besides olde age .
KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,86.9

My best intelligence of his estate is from his Apothecarye , who comes
every day to my cosin Knyvett , KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,86.10

And he sweares he can@ @not hould out because his spirritts are much
spent . KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,86.11

Christian charitye bindes me to praye for his good passage into another
world , And the best way , which I praye God I may really and truly
performe , KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,86.12

But I thinke I shall not hurt my selfe with to much mourninge for him ,
goe when he will . KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,86.13

My Lady yor mother , I thanke God , is very well and cheerly ,
KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,86.14

{COM:preceding_word_"abreaking"_emended} , <P_87> so that over another
weeke I hope it wil@ @be good travailing . KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,87.21

Deere Harte , I exspected this day to have had a returne of some good
newes of yor wellfares at Quidd'nham , KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.201

but I heare that letters are intercepted & the post arreasted by the way
, so that I feare yo=r= letters are amongst them .
KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.202

Howesoever I can@ @not but write the faithfull tender of my affection to
thee , hopeing I shall finde some trusty messenger to convaye my love ,
althoughe but a day before I bringe it my selfe .
KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.203

My only staye nowe is to see howe it will please God to deale with my
cosin Knyvett , KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.204

for in my Judgment he can@ @not subsist many dayes .
KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.205

All o=r= good hopes of him are within these 2 dayes utterly dasht ,
KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.206

& this very day his Phisitions , which weare 3 in number , had a meeting
of consultation aboute him , KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.207

& hath given him over & set him at Liberty to eate or drinke what he
will or can , which is Just nothing . KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.208

He hath a continuall scoureing , KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.209

& that with a great deale of tormenting paine , which hath made him very
impatient with@ @all people aboute him , KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.210

but as his spirritts decaye so he growes Quietter .
KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.211

God of his mercye comforte him . KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.212

And nowe , sweet harte , let me tel you I would not for 500@ @=l=. but
that I had made this Journye although {SIC:althouge} it be chargeable to
me . KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.213

for he is nowe past discoursing of any busines .
KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.215

Yet , poore man , hath he neglected his owne estate so much as his will
is yet to perfect , which much troubles him although I veryly beleeve
his Inventory will not be greate . KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.216

I hope my Landlord Elsing shall get into the office .
KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.217

He doth much Labore for it , KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,92.218

& I doe wish with all <P_93> my harte he may obtaine it ,
KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,93.219

for he is a very loving kind_harted man , KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,93.220

And suerly , if he gets it , we shall not want of a stowage whensoever
we have a minde to come to London . KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,93.221

This day was ther made a younge Pegg , KNYVETT-1637-E2-P2,93.222
